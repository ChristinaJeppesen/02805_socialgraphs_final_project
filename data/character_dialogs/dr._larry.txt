oh well im sorry but we cant buy those from you now
im afraid the government has just put a ban on stem-cell research
too many people were upset about using aborted fetal tissue for a study its too bad too we really coulda helped a lot of people
this is where the bulk of our research was being done but due to the government ban were mostly just packing things up
look you have trillions of cells in your body heart cells skin cells brain cells and so on but before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell its what we call a stem cell sort of like a blank cell do you understand
because these cells are blanks they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them you see this rat earlier this year we surgically removed the middle of her spine then we injected her with some stem cells and they became the missing part of the spine
nerve cells damaged by parkinsons disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells
thats the theory
well no to build another shakes it would be better to use lumber
but unfortunately the government has banned stem cell research and so well never know
where are you going
hey kid give em hell give em hell
oh hey kid good luck good luck
