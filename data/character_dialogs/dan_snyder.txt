my name is dan snyder im the president and owner of the washington redskins
thank you but i will stand
young man we ask that you please stop using the name washington redskins for your organization
because we are the washington redskins and we are a football team you have no right to use our name to get attention
look dont you see that when you call your organization "the washington redskins" its offensive to us
we are a proud team mr cartman we have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing
uh i know i cant legally make you stop using our name but but wont you just do it out of decency
is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to isis you have to do something commissioner goodell what are you going to do about this
what
thats the most ridiculous nothing answer ive ever heard what are you gonna do now
ugh this thing is broken
get all the nfl owners on skype this thing is broken again
and so i call upon the help of all owners you cannot let my people be belittled like this
the stupid thing isnt working
look my team is starting to lose hope you have to use your influence to make these people change their name
and so im alone what if they ridicule the 49ers team next or make fun of jerry jones because his eyes are too far apart
uh i guess we can live with that
thank god
caw-caw caw-caw hoohoo hoohoohoo
no no we cannot give up we have been through too much together we have fought eagle and bear the eagles only beat us by three points
dont let them break you dont let them win
hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut
hut hut hut
