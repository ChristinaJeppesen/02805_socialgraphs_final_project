havent you ever been curious about the insanity barbra streisand exhibits
more than a bitch shes a calculating self-centered egotistical bitch she was born in a small town her mother was a jackal and her father was an insurance salesman
when she was five she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer but by the time she was six her ambitions became to rule the universe she learned of an ancient diamond the diamond of pantheos
before she was seven the keepers of pantheos learned of this insane little girls wish the diamond was split up and buried at opposite ends of the world but then during the shooting of my fair lady barbra streisand found one of the triangles
yes mr chef if babs gets a hold of that other triangle she will fulfill her prophecy and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind mecha-streisand
