theyre never gonna catch the serial killer hes too smart do you want to see my cotton panties
you you give everyone else credit for my work because you fail to see my greatness
because of you nobody knows the extent of my deeds
you are obviously a big fan of my work
but i am the serial killer the one whose rightful place in history you have smirched
and now you will have a place of honor as my nineteenth victim
before you die let me show you the things that ive done so you will understand the breadth of my transformation this is me at the grand canyon do you see this is me at mount rushmore do you see
do you see
here i am at the alamo in san antonio this was just outside of the gift shop do you see
look look at the things ive done here i am at yellowstone national park do you see here are pictures of my trip to cheyenne for frontier days do you see
god
thats it no more pictures time to die
your hand will be one with the others
