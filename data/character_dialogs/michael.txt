so lame why doesnt everyone just die
hey come over here look
thats real pain right there
she said that her parents called her an emo and she had to go to this camp for two weeks
i dont know she texted from the bus they put her on then she said she wasnt even allowed to have her cell phone where she was going then all of a sudden her texts went dark
i just cant believe it i cant believe parents would do that to their child
yes they called her an emo
emos suck theyre vile self-pitying depressed assholes
because shes goth and some ignorant people dont know the difference
alright alright think of it this way a goth believes that deep down the world is totally fucked up but an emo thinks that deep down they are totally fucked up
okay okay look emos are more prone to suicide
but goths are more prone to be depressed that so many people commit suicide
wait i thought we were cynical whatever it doesnt matter
oh yeah youre right
shes only been there two weeks they cant have changed her that much can they have
oh my god its worse than we thought they made her emo
has she said one word to either one of you guys
she wont even look at us all she does now is hang out with the douchebag emo kids
there must something else going on here
its not your mom its me
what did they do you at that camp
dont take this the wrong way but i think that place turned you into an emo
then why are you listening to sunny day real estate i was thinking maybe they just made you confused at that place maybe they didnt know what they were doing but then i started thinking maybe that place turned you emo on purpose like maybe they knew what they were doing
what
nooo waaaaay
omigodnowaaaaaaaaay
no waaay no way no waaaaaay
its worse than we thought
no i mean henrietta i confronted her and she was all like "i am emo and emos are going to rule the world" and i was like "no waaay" and she was like "yeah soon it will be too late" and i was all "no waaay"
