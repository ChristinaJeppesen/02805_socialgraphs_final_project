but what about the violence the lives lost if we found a country it should be founded on peace and diplomacy
dont you call us unpatriotic were protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our colonies you are all unpatriotic for leading the colonies into a war that half of them dont want
we cannot found a country based on war
right if the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish then some will support the war and some will protest it
