ey you guys know the rules nobody can show the image of mohammad anymore its dangerous
look im not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network lets just forget aboat it okay guys aw come on guys give me a break
ey i run this network not you guys and if you ask me your show has become so preachy and full of messages that youve forgotten how to be funny no mohammad
i doubt it ill bet that right now somebody is on their way to fox network to demand that that episode be pulled
okay lets discuss the fall lineup
all right lets get this over with
i feel terrible its so easy to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face
little boy will you talk to the family guy writing staff if your story touches their hearts like it has ours perhaps theyll back down from demanding we air the episode
take this noble child over to the family guy offices if he can scare them like he has us maybe we can pull the mohammad episode after all
what was that
i dont understand it whats wrong with them
but nobody took any idea balls out of the tank did they
then why are they refusing to write i agreed to show mohammad uncensored i did what you asked what do you want from me
youre right its time i stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do im pulling the mohammad episode you got that and if you all dont want to work tomorrow you can just find other jobs how long before family guys supposed to air
i gotta hurry
