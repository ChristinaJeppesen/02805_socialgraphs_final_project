i took the job to try and make canadas health care system better what could that have to do with my wife
thanks guy
have you ever had someone you love queef in your face
im sorry im calling everyone in the canadian health care system to find out if theyre pleased with their health care is this ike broflovski
your brother receives his medication from us so we just wanna be sure hes satisfied with the service
before this meeting continues i should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores
people all over the world get their medication from canada
thats impossible the canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with intellilink
sure no problem now what is your brothers canadian medicares smartname
"strangetamer" uh yep there it is ahh yes here we go i see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last may ah yes im afraid intellilink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast
yes thats right
its fine it works fine just give it some time god you sound like my wife my my wife
and thats why she queefed in my face
it was a mistake
trying to reform canadas health care system and being too stubborn to admit that it wasnt working and even when my wife said the system was too complicated i wouldnt listen
i deserved it anyone who thinks streamlining health care into an integreated health care system would go smoothly deserves a giant queef in their face thank you my lady
yes ive upgraded to the gold package within no time canadians everywhere will be getting their correct medications and going back to normal
