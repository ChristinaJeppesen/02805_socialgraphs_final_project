take a free spin double your odds
how can i help you noble sir
a what
uh i can help get you some credit or a comp meal perhaps
look kid this is just a casino i cant help you you know not every british person knows about wizards and dragons and curses
the rune stone of gaelic where did you get this
the skire once spoke of such a stone come we must see the sorcerer
these americans wish to see the skire
how could you foolish americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness
didnt you realize "shit" is a curse word
ha leave it to americans to think that "no" means yes "pissed" means angry and "curse word" means something other than a word thats cursed
saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing its only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place
