when i say "go" you slam your electric wheelchair into high gear okay timmy

alright get ready timmy
dude maybe we dont have to rip a tooth out of kennys mouth
yeah lets go
no timmy wait
come on fatass
did the tooth fairy come
four dollars
no more money
cartman whats going on
what do you mean "theres no tooth fairy"
that cant be my parents wouldnt lie to me
youre wrong if my dad says something is real then its real
its not true
dad there is so a tooth fairy huh
oh my god you did lie to me
peter pan too
what about moses and abraham
probably is atlantis real

fun for children fun for children look at me dad i dont even know whats real anymore weaaaah
what about dan rather do you think hes real
all made up not real nothings real
oh my god what if im not real
i mean what if im just part of my parents reality
what if this is all just somebodys dream
two years
cartman
see ya
dude this book says there could be infinite alternate realities to every reality
oh my god this book says that negative and positive are the same thing that real and not real are one
dude this book says i dont exist unless i think i do but what if i dont
i cant deal with it stan i mean all the stuff ive been reading i really dont think i exist
but i cant because what if thinking about it is the only thing keeping my space-time together
sometimes i think i can see time slowing down and my own existence fading
light is a wave unless its observed that means all matter is just a wave nothings real reality in a nuh- oh god its happening
i am nothing and everything
hunh that was pretty weird
yeah but you know ive learned something today you see the basis of all reasoning is the minds awareness of itself what we think the external objects we perceive are all like actors that come on and off stage but our consciousness the stage itself is always present to us
oh yeah
phil collins hill on saturday you got it
fatass
what the hell are they doing
dont worry dude that little truck just runs on d batteries its gonna run out of juice soon
yeah cartmans weight was what gave us speed so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides cartman
yeah okay get over here clyde
yeah fatass get your fat butt on the sled
awwgh hey dude we dont even have enough weight to move
yeah why dont you go eat some more pork rinds or something you fat fuck
we killed kenny
well that didnt work what else can we try
if only we had realized how special our time with his gigantic ass was
how
sweet lets go
hey fatass hows prison
yeah so you gotta bust out of here so we made you this cake theres a ailnay ilefay inside of it
an ailnay ilefay
listen aggotfay an ailnay ilefay so you can eakbray out of isonpray
they ontday why the ellhay otnay it ooktay ourfay ourshay to akebay this od-damnedgay akecay and ownay were otallytay ewedscray
well we got some cigarettes but we dont think you should be smoking each year over a million people die of smo-
me too
dont fart on your way out you might make little smoke signals
so now what do we do
dude i didnt know tolkien lived so far away
yeah but isnt tolkien the only one
killer
well then youve got to call the jail right now and tell them that you forgive cartman for being a dumbass
dammit son of a bitch dammit oh sorry
huh
why not
i dont start you start
and we think that that is a savage hypocrisy because all crimes are hate crimes if a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife is that not a hate crime
but instead we should all be treated the same with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes for in that way cartman can be freed from prison and we will have a chance to win the sledding race on thursday
hes gotta show up hes just got to
dude i guess weve just got to try it without him
on the sled fatass
go fatass
oh no the girls are gonna win
we won we won
its good to have you back cartman
yeah but there was so much of it i was up until two in the morning
the declaration of independence
hey wait i think maybe i have attention diffunction disorder
i am eight
no way
he looks pretty happy to me
dude did you see that stuff phil collins was saying about timmy
we all have attention deficit disorder so we all started taking ritalin
thats correct chef
yes but now we dont have any homework so we can go see timmy play downtown at mile high stadium
no not at all
gee you seem a little stressed mr garrison why dont you try some ritalin

you know something i think thats good it was wrong to make timmy a singer
yeah i think phil collins rocks the house
bastard
phil collins is playing lalapalalas and because were all doing so well in school now our parents said they would take us
yes his flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us
come see him with us
yeah
yeah what the hell were we thinking boooooo
yeah
yeah tim-my tim-my
awwww
how long does this thing last
whoa
those contorting romanian chicks rule
cartman what the hell are you talking about theyre identical
hey we should start our own cirque du cheville

heheh we could make you say whatever we wanted

ah

hey man if youre jewish you get presents for eight days
hey you guys look what i have
four tickets to the lion king on stage
aww come on you guys its supposed to be really cool
what doughboy
what
what
goddamnit cartman what are they gonna say on cop drama
theyre gonna say "shit" on television
bu- but i got these tickets to see lion king on stage
its just a marketing ploy by the network like that time they had the first male-to-male kiss with terrance and phillip
its stupid
no i dont have sand in my vagina i just think its a little immature for us to be standing around talking about one dumb word being on tv
hey butters i got tickets to go see lion king tonight and i decided to invite you before anybody else
how many ways are there to take it its just a stupid word
im going to the kitchen this is stupid
i dont really give a fuck
well i hope it lived up to all the hype you must feel so much better now
do you really think anythings gonna be any different now do you really think that this will have the tiniest smallest effect on the world its still the same old world out there look what the hell
oh whatever
this is ridiculous just because they say it on tv its alright
its not new im gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it
theres no sand in my vagina
you guys you guys ive looked up the word "shit" i think it might have something to do with people dying
havent you noticed everyone getting sick it all started when they said "shit" on television
i am not full of meecro- what look the word "shit" first showed up in english in the 1340s the same time as something called "the black death"
look it might be a coincidence but i think wed better ask someone come on
chef do you know where "shit" comes from
no no the word "shit"
ungh it said in my book that the word "shit" started exactly the same time as something called "the black death"
right but in the 1340s people in england stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit" the same year as the black plague
a curse word
cartman this is serious
dude this plague is spreading like wildfire
weve gotta do something chef if we dont we dont stop that network "shit" will become an even more acceptable word
cartman stop being an asshole
we think that you might have caused it by helping make "shit" an everyday word
its true we think that word might be plaguing our friend kenny
no
now what
we need some help identifying an ancient english stone
and asshole
wait
its okay the curse has been lifted
you see weve learned something today swearing can be fun but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems
were all saying the s-word too much
the knights of standards and practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum "curse words" theyre called that because they are a curse we have to go back to only using curse words in rare extreme circumstances
thats pretty cool dude
hes a magician named david blaine dude he kicks ass
wow thats cool
damn that guy is the coolest guy in the universe
"david blaine workshop learn all about david blaine at the center for magic" dude we gotta go

no no this isnt possible
no i mean this is impossible stan cartman is the biggest asshole in the world how is it that god gives him a million dollars
why how could you do this there are people starving in alabama and and you give cartman a million dollars
do you know what happened to me this morning stan this morning i woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass i felt down there and and found this big sore lump on my ass stan i couldnt even sit down so i i had to tell my mother which which was humiliating she took me to the doctor which was more humiliating a- a- nd he told me i-i have a hemorrhoid its like an infected blood vessel on your ass im nine years old and i have a hemorrhoid stan i have a hemorrhoid and cartman has his own theme park
do you do you stan because all my life i was raised to believe in jehovah to believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us i make mistakes but every week i try to better myself im always saying "you know i learned something today" and what does this so-called god give me in return a hemorrhoid he doesnt make sense what is your logic ow
great
its my seat ring i have to sit on it because of my hemorrhoid ow
so how are things going at cartmans theme park
hunh i guess youre right
where are we going
ah ow hey it hurts owie-ow help ow that hurts

lucky
oh im swell stan i popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into cartmanland and it got infected i really need to go to the bathroom but if i do it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out how are you
but its okay stan because i finally figured it out you see if someone like cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park then there is no god theres no god dude
why why mom because if i do something bad will happen to me because if i do your god might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids
no i finally do understand there is no justice there is no god do you hear me i renounce my faith
agh agghh
awesome
ive had enough of the bible what has it gotten me
satan talked to god
and thats it thats the end
thats the most horrible story ive ever heard why would god do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to satan

stan oh well no theres nothing here from stan but well stans gonna come and see you real soon i bet kenny
neat huh kenny
he said his wish is not to die
he said madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago and that now she suddenly speaks with a british accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself
he just he just stopped breathing and it was over
he just said "wheres stan"
what cartman
i actually hugged you i held you in my arms and and cried with you
aaargh
aha and ill have the city chicken
okay not-kenny
dude thats today
excuse me could we get through here
dude did you really lose all that weight eating nothing but sub sandwiches
them
oh "a i d e s" aides
well thats not really what you say in the commercial
but youre lying to people if they knew that you didnt eat just all the sandwiches you want you might not be so popular
it matters dude
that penisbutt didnt lose weight eating sub sandwiches he lost weight because he ate less of them and exercised
tha- thats diarrhea
thats a great idea
but butters isnt fat
yeah dude youll be just like jared
city wok brought him down to a size 4
chef we need butters to gain about fifty pounds fast
yeah none of us wanna marry butters
you have to here have some more mayonnaise
twenty-two point three years thats how long it takes for something tragic to become funny
wow he looks great
nope we wanna show the world how healthy your food is our fat friend here is going to lose forty pounds eating at shitty wok
because then you can pay us to use our friend in commercials
yeah were all set
well what do you mean
wow
yeah youre still fat
why are you doing this to us
okay it says here the operation begins with a one-inch incision in the ab-do-men on the left side just above the hip
okay now put one end of the tube a half an inch into the incision
the liposuction is a process of siphoning out the excess fat
alright its working
its out of control
to city wok so we can make our money god
yep
wow that was pretty good
we have great news our friend has lost forty pounds eating your city wok food heres the before and after photos
uh why not
wait youre all making a mistake
aw just forget the whole thing then
yeah but you know ive learned something today it would have been wrong to exploit butters weight loss because then lots of fat people would have believed it and then gone and eaten a ton of chinese food instead of dieting properly theyd still be fat and wed be responsible for their shattered dreams
no dude youre supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee
what
go on ike

thats bull-crap tv shows are gay
they were wearing cowboy hats did you see did you see

lame
but we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend lame as they were
were sorry butters our mind is made up
phew
hm he took that pretty well i think
tweek now theres an interesting choice tweek has a lot of qualities that i look for in a friend
towelie is a tough choice because even though i can see how always having a towel around can come in handy hes just always so high
but right now id say if were gonna have a retard for a friend i i have to pick timmy because timmy doesnt tell lame jokes
tolkien clyde craig timmy
pip jimmy jason towelie luigi
tweek
this looks pretty good
youre such a fatass cartman
tolkien
timmy
tweek pip
towelie
jimmy
anything thatll impress us tolkien
well tolkien was a definite winner of the talent show but then we decided to take everyone to a baseball game to see how we got along there
yeah isnt this great
towelie is cool but he gets stoned all the time you cant really rely on him for anything
eh now come on you guys we cant take this decision lightly whoever we pick is going to be the person we do everything with from now on
so youre a smartass
good point
cool
just stick it on
yeah
well tweeks okay but hes certainly no kenny
yeah
no way
nuh uh
no way
only sixteen dollars they cant be cool if theyre only sixteen dollars
ah alright
i told you cartman
hey lets pour them in the teachers coffee tomorrow morning
see were just watching cartoons like always nothings changed
oh god
yeah but youre our new friend and that makes you cul p-piable
we dont know who else to talk to
wow i guess this really is a big deal
theres nothing here
yeah its ms choksondik alright
ms choksondik stinks inside
quick hide
got it
it is
oh really
im so glad were not murderers
whoa
whoa
well what are you gonna do
wow thats a lot of sea men youve got there cartman
huh
hey we paid for the sea people too how come theyre not making statues of us
yeah so
hey its tweek
the sea people from cartmans side are suicide-bombing the buildings on tweeks side
yep but i guess this proves that war is the natural order of life
hey dudes
what are you guys doin
in your butts
why would he put anything in your butts
hm
calm down tweek there has to be a rational explanation
yeah
cartman thats the dumbest thing youve ever said - this week
it wouldnt work
i dont need to it wouldnt work
youre on fat boy
well cartman
well go on smartass and do it
no because youll just crap out your butt and then say it came out of your mouth
get the fuck out of here
what
go fuck yourself cartman
get up fat boy im gonna kick your ass
so you crapped out of your mouth good for you its still stupid and immature
it is stupid and immature so you got people to crap out of their mouths what do you want a freakin medal
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
so
cartman theres something i need to tell you
you were totally one hundred percent right
you won the bet you were totally accurate about being able to crap out your mouth and ive just been frustrated because i didnt think of it first i want you to enjoy that money because you really impressed me with your insight and im proud to have you as a friend
no dude spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make et more pc
why dont they leave those movies alone we liked them the way they were
yeah what if they had modified the roman coliseum every year it would just be another big douchey stadium now
yeah well be the "save films from their own directors" club
"free hat"
calm down tweek fifteen might be enough
tweek its okay look maybe these people all turned out because they believe in saving films maybe they dont even care about the free hats
we believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers
what
yah
you why
me
alright fine youre the spokesman cartman but youd better not screw it up
we believe that films have to be taken away from people like steven spielberg and george lucas because theyre insane
ah we thought we were speaking for the children
dude dont you see that its not itd be like changing raiders of the lost ark
no noo
nonono we need to do this first
were just gonna fly to california and break into george lucass house whats stressful about that
this looks like the right room
thats it
do with us what you will mr lucas but please dont change raiders of the lost ark
but you cant melt ice with a cool song r-tard
well then were gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song
its not too late to do whats right give us the print theres still some good in you mr lucas we know there is
you yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films you understand why films shouldnt be changed
when an artist creates whatever they create belongs to society
dont listen to him you still have a chance to preserve your film
what
yup
come on tweek blow it up
yeah i i think so
what
do you think we did a good thing stan i mean no one even seemed to notice
she did but now theyre saying we have to start going back to school anyways its totally gay

god-damnit
hes right dude we have to define our style if were ever going to make a platinum album i mean ah im a fusion guy but kennys background is more latin jazz
i think out band better buy a whole bunch of music cds to listen to for inspiration
christian rock
thats a retarded idea cartman
just get the hell out of here cartman youre not serious and youre a detriment to the band
youre on fat boy
what a stupid asshole
dad can i borrow three hundred dollars
our band cant find a stylistic direction to go in we need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of cds to listen to so we can define our sound
ugh cant you see this is my dream music is my life
hold it pops ive got the music inside me its in my soul and i know my place is up on that stage im gonna make it to the top and i just want your blessing pops
aw come on dad dont be such a jew
aaaargh
it didnt work my stupid jew dad wont lend me money for cds
really
all right cool lets download some metallica and some stevie wonder
judas priest wow downloading music for free is awesome
i dont know let me go check
i dont know
um sir-
we d-didnt think it was that big a deal
whats the matter with him
we didnt realize what we were doing eh
so hes gonna get it right
no didnt you guys learn anything look if we make an album all thats gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the internet we wont make a dime
until we get people to stop downloading music for free i say we refuse to play
were not letting you back in the band cartman fuck off
you get a platinum album for selling one million copies you fat turd
youll never get a platinum album doing christian rock cartman it was a stupid idea then and its a stupid idea now
go ahead people will just download your songs for free on the internet anyways
yeah its tough but its times like these that you see what your band is made of weve gotta fight through the rough times like journey
you guys we cant give up on our dreams now as soon as this strike ends were gonna be the biggest band ever
im sure were gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop
thats us "dear moop this letter is to inform you that faith plus ones debut album has just sold one million copies"
"we cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony which will be held tomorrow morning at ten details and proof of sales enclosed ps nananana na na hahahaha ha ha" he did it cartman got a platinum album
he beat us because all this time weve been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play
because thats what real artists do people are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free if were real musicians then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening
from now on moop isnt about money moop is about music were not striking anymore whos with us
oh
i dont have a choice dude im gonna swallow my pride face cartman and say "congratulations you were right" and im gonna give him the ten dollars and hopefully he wont make a big deal out of it
lets just get this over with cartman you won the bet heres ten dollars
this is the worst day of my life

jesus christ [cartman ends up face down in the water which isnt deep enough to drown him he flips over and coughs
oh dude what a little asshole
dude that new kid is such a douche
come on dude somebody needs to wipe that fuckin smirk off his face
what are they doing
what happened
youre having dinner with his family what kind of family has a kid like that
yeah did you make out with him too
wow
oh hey stan wheres your best buddy gary
oh no
dude this is unbearable
aw dude this is really hard
throw em away dudes here he comes guys stop coughing
dawww sick
oh god
yeah this is really their fault
whos rob reiner
you guys maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasnt the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke
well its just that eh this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands you know its been happening a lot lately how about this time we just put a stop to it right now
oh no
but isnt that kind of lying
what
so tobacco helped to build america
that sounds perfectly reasonable
but dude youre making stuff up
guys i think we should bail out of this right now
this is just startin to look like another one of those times where it-its gonna end up with the whole town turning out its a big showdown happening and us havin to talk about what we learned and i say we just stop right now and go play cards or something
go ahead we dont wanna be in their stupid commercial
no we really want nothing more to do with these people
what are you doing
cartman you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow but im warning you those anti-smoking people are liars and theyre bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want and that means theyre dangerous
whos going to kill you
yeah dude dont get us killed too
no dude get away
yeah go to the tobacco company yourself
yeah dude you were totally wrong
no what we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves even if it means getting grounded
because if we go to the tobacco company i know exactly whatll happen theyll take us in and then rob reiner will show up with all the townspeople holding torches or something and therell be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned and change everyones minds - this is all following a formula
god-damnit
no it isnt you fat turd because ive learned something today you just hate- see i knew it
you just hate smoking so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you and thats called fascism you tubby asshole

butters
its hopeless dude butters must have made it to the hospital by now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons we have to get rid of the evidence

screw you fatass
i- i cant do it i cant do it i

dude they dont care we knocked butters eye out with weapons
uh yeah i agree uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didnt know how to deal with what i was seeing c-cartman should be punished
yeah i c- i cant believe it
so i guess this means we get to keep our weapons
theyre olympic games for handicapped people
yeah thatd be cool
well all right well see you on saturday guys
youre an asshole cartman
what
oh no cartman no
cartman i will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the special olympics
because
god damn you
no youre not i read the brochure cartman if youre under eighteen you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the special olympics
it says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up" and youll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible so ha
cartman i really really have a problem with what youre doing i object to it morally and i find it grossly offensive
i know that i often have serious moral objections to the things that you do but this time i think you really need to reconsider because if you do this i believe you will go to hell so i feel it is my responsibility as your friend to tell people what youre doing and to put a stop to it
i didnt come here to talk about the passion cartman
i came here to talk about you
im a vulcan
the atmosphere is oxygen-based should support our breathing
no im on the away team too
i dont care youre not making me wait in the van again
i am picking up carbon-based life forms in sector c i believe we will find a village of peaceful aliens over that ridge
no it doesnt
no im not god damn it cartman youre not gonna kill me off again
shut up about jews fatass you dont know anything
he does not
naw uh
im not arguing about the passion hes being an asshole
people dont hate the jews
youre a stupid asshole
one please
yeah i know but i have to-
thanks
haaaah
how how could the jews do that to jesus
you were right you were right all along i thought you were just an asshole when you ripped on jews but i didnt know i i didnt know
you were you were right
you were right
kill jesus yesss arrrgh
oh okay but did god sent jesus to die or did jesus just get kind of screwed over
well i have this friend see and this friend belongs to a certain chosen people of israel and it so happens that these chosen people killed your lord
right but he cant live with the guilt anymore because even if jesus wasnt really the son of god he was still a nice guy and he didnt deserve what happened to him in mel gibsons movie i i cant sleep at night i mean my friend cant sleep at night
but how can the jews make it better
wait thats it atonement of course i know what i have to do now thank you father
thank you rabbi in 1973 the united states officially issued an apology to the african american community for slavery in 1956 germany officially apologized for world war ii and the holocaust and now i believe in 2004 the jewish community needs to apologize for the death of jesus
if we as a people choose not to believe that jesus is the son of god then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed and take our share of the responsibility for it
i saw the passion
both you guys stop please youre gonna make people hate us more
no no no dont become an angry mob the last time we did that we killed jesus
look out
dude whats wrong with him
dude ive been freaked out this whole time because of that guys movie
oh dude i feel so much better about being jewish now that i see that mel gibson is just a big wacko douche
sweet i made mine go off the jump
hey who are those kids
what the hell just happened
yeah
dude that is a sweet rc car
were not interested thanks
yeah go stan
all right stan
yeah you got served
thats right
what the hell are you doing fatass
why
why
oh wait hey awesom-o id also like some celery sticks chopped up two inches long with peanut butter and raisins on top
yeah i think they already moved in i saw moving vans in their driveway two days ago
'''' hey look
hey do you live here
dude he just be loaded what does he do
'''' what's wrong with his face
mr jefferson your son can't get up
mr jefferson
mr jefferson said we can invite all the kids in town to go play over at their house
dude what happened to your knee
'''' mr jefferson
mr- goddammit here come on we need to clean that up ''''
alright this is gonna sting for a second
i know i know be cool
so dude do you have any brothers or sisters
and where is ''your'' mom
you must have a mom
you mean she doesn't live here or she's dead or what
what
so you never met your mom
yeah yeah that counts
you guys i feel kinda bad for that kid
mr jefferson just seems like he wants to ''be'' a kid not have one
they're tv dinners don't you wanna take that veil off so you can eat
dude look who i found prowling around in my back yard
he was out all alone in the middle of the night mr jefferson isn't even home
what
come on blanket
'''' that poor kid
hey blanket uh look we're goin' over to help my dad chop wood you wanna come with
'''' jesus christ dude
dude we have got to get that kid away from him
all right thanks a lot for helping us dude
'''' i don't think mr jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice come on ''''
shh blanket we're gonna take you away for a little while okay ''''
come on blanket we gotta go before your dad sees us
you bastard
'''' come on
'''' hang on blanket
'''' all right let's just say all the bad things said about mr jefferson are lies let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit let's say it's all made up and mr jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood well that's fine except for that he has children now and when people have children they have to grow up
all right things just might work out
youve been on your fucking phone since we started
a break from what you havent done anything
all you ever do is talk about your balls
if you want your share of the money then youre gonna shovel snow like the rest of us

dude hold on this is bullcrap if they wanna live in our time then they should learn our language

how how did this happen mom dad why are you shopping here
hey hey who the hell told you to put this thing back up
but nobody wants a wall-mart here

no way you wanna go with us so you can betray us at some point and keep us from destroying the wall-mart
yeah huh you wanna go with us so that later you go "haha i was working for wall-mart all along" or something
all right fine come on fatass
i heard that
you said we have no idea that youre never let us hurt wall-mart
he is working for the wall-mart to stop us from succeeding
god-damnit
it wouldve been faster if cartman hadnt slashed the tires
yeah weve come to complain we dont want a wall-mart in our town
we want to talk to whos in charge
so how do we stop it
the heart of wall-mart
all right cmon you guys we have to get back home
all right this is it if wall-mart has a heart we have to find it and destroy it no matter what the wall-mart does to try to stop us we have to be strong lets do it

my mom is gonna break my legs
not us were good kids
dude when he gets out of juvenile hall hes gonna wanna kill us
we cant tell our parents dude we lied to everybody nobody knows were responsible for ms claridges accident
look that was a long time ago maybe trent boyett has forgotten all about it
thats nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out ive been lying for five years
dude we shouldnt be here
we need you to protect us from a bully
well well what do you want
wait well do it
why dont you just sneak in your moms closet and get a picture when shes changing clothes
what else has big round squishy globes

oh wait we forgot the necklace
god i hope this works
okay so now youll help us take care of trent boyett
naw
man i would have loved to seen to seen the look on trent boyetts face when all the sixth graders showed up
oh jesus you told him that
weve gotta move away weve gotta get as far away from this town as possible
from who we cant ask adults for help and theres nobody tougher than sixth graders
so youre gonna help us
the thing is ms claridge we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids
our lives have not been enjoyable trent i promise you
dude when he gets out hes gonna be really mad
another devastating loss for the cows last night eric they were ahead in the game until kelly anderson started crying because she missed her daddy whos on a business trip in thailand uh kelly was so upset she couldnt play and the cows had to forfeit
what
geez all that from a stupid video show
gah i just dont get it
yeah maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week theyll let us stay on the air
how about we revamp the name super school news sounds dry
maybe the problem is we dont have very good stories to report on
maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or theyll die
eric sources are speculating that third-grade student pete thelman pees sitting down like a girl weve also got confirmation that sally turner stuffs her bra and clyde donovan has only one testicle
were making the news more appealing to students
we beat close-up animals
yeah jimmys right i know we can come up with way better ideas than craig
what if we do a show where we- uh no
uhhh what if the-
wait you know what we should do we should all take a bunch of cough medicine
thats what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess they take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads
how do we know which one to use
its not
oh okay
all right now everybody take a tablet and a pencil and when all the ideas start coming just write em down we might not remember everything otherwise
stan dude stan you all right
me too
i could watch this for days
ah
butters get away from me
i wrote down all the lyrics to the happy days theme song
jesus you may be right
so where are students getting all this cough medicine this surveillance footage shows a group of troubled kids getting all the smack they want from a pharmacist sexy action school news reported the pharmacist to the south park police and he was immediately arrested
twenty-two people all right
dude bail
whats going on
do it do it
dont listen to em cartman im sure itll work go for it yaaay cartman fly fly fly
awww go on and do it already

this is fuckin ridiculous
what the hell is wrong with these people
hey what about this guy
hey uh does anyone know who that guy is
excuse me sir i think i know who did this we saw this guy at the last crime scene and and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime well i followed this guy to his house and when he left again i collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis im pretty sure hes your man
no
why wont anybody listen to me
i am taking it personally because cartman is a retard just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesnt mean hes a- wait thats it if i want people to listen to me i just have to be as stupid as cartman
be sure to take me to the same hospital
all right here we go since the days of copernicus man has dreamed of flight on this historic day we remem- aw screw it
i see a man with a baseball cap hes killing now oh im seeing it all flash before my eyes the guys name is michael deets and he lives at 621 castillo street hes usually there between seven and eleven pm
no dont you see cartman never had psychic visions and neither do these people the plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic theres a logical explanation for every psychic story youve ever heard
just stop it stoop iiit theres a logical explanation for that

because hes a fat racist self-centered intolerant manipulating sociopath
there were no good times and if he really feels bad he can just tell me himself
it was cartman having butters apologize for him
he probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone well think hes changed and let him back into our circle
we didnt think that by pretending you didnt exist you would really change but you really have

we came to learn the facts about people with red hair light skin and freckles
but its its not true they have no souls
i just had a couple more questions about-

yeah i hope he makes his salisbury steak with buttered noodles
like what
weirdo
good
chef a-are you ok
this doesnt make any sense
goddammit chef isnt like that something funny is going on around here
chef the police are asking questions about you
chef chef you need to get out of here before you get arrested all right
he didnt want us for sex fatass something is making him say those things
something must have happened to chef while he was gone maybe he hit his head or or got stuck in some quantum time vortex
all right come on guys
ahh hi can we speak to the head guy or something
uh hi our friend joined your club a while back and now he wants to molest kids
well we thought you went exploring and like hunting and stuff
dude
dude what are you doing
just what the hell is that thing
ha i knew it
the reason chef has been saying those terrible things about us is because hes been brainwashed by this - fruity little club
all right come on
hi uh- our friend has been brainwashed by some fruity little club
but we dont have years if chef keeps this up hes gonna go to jail forever
no thanks were trying to unbrainwash our friend
come on chef you can do it
do you realize how retarded that sounds
were not going anywhere without chef
no hey
sorry dude but this fruity little club isnt taking our friend
chef come on
here
get outside
yeah he wanted adventure not a bunch of ridiculous bullcrap right chef chef
no chef theyve filled your head with lies cant you see that
chef
you bastards you bastards
were all here today because chef has been such an important part of our lives a lot of us dont agree with the choices chef has made in the past few days some of us feel hurt and confused that he seemed to turn his back on us but we cant let the events of the last week take away the memories of how much chef made us smile im gonna remember chef as the jolly old guy who always broke into song im gonna remember chef as the guy who gave us advice to live by so you see we shouldnt be mad at chef for leaving us we should be mad at that little fruity club for scrambling his brains
and in the end i know that somewhere out there theres the good part of chef thats still alive in us all

look cartman i dont know whats gotten into you but i i think its pretty amazing and i think its real you have to understand why i didnt believe you before
its a long trip dude youre gonna need help we can try and get the episode pulled together
i know but just like you i feel like i have to try people can really get hurt and a joke just isnt worth that
i got some sound advice from an old friend
yeah
im set lets do this
we got six days to make it to los angeles if we keep our stops to a minimum we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time
off the air but were just going to try to get the mohammad episode pulled
whoa whoa wait a minute this isnt what i signed up for i like family guy why do we have to get it off the air forever
but that doesnt mean it has to go off the air you should like that show your sense of humor is just like family guy
you unbelievable son of a bitch you never cared about the muslim religion or the safety of people in america you just want family guy off the air
what are you talking about
i cant believe i let you scare me into taking your side you used fear to make me stop believing in free speech
no i am not letting you go to that television studio and pretend to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you dont like off the air
what cartman
ahhh
no aaaah aaaah
you son of a bitch i wont let you win you hear me
you just want family guy off the air
you son of a bitch i wont let you win
what the hell is going on hello excuse me i need to get to los angeles hello
who
thanks a lot for the ride
ill do everything i can
excuse me do you know which way the network presidents office is
look my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting family guy off the air
oh thanks dude
hello this cant be right i- ow
let me out of here kid why are you doing this
cartman
you fat son of a bitch
well a lot of people like family guy too who are you to decide it shouldnt be on the air
cartman let me out of this stupid net
what
cartmaaaan you fucking fatass
that kid and i had a long talk i told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you
you are not killing family guy
theres still time to tell the network president youre full of crap
get out of my way or ill kick your ass
ow quit it
ow quit it
no more timeouts fatass
thanks kid
sir mister television executive stop
listen to me the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child he only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of family guy forever
pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction youll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely its what happened to laverne & shirley
what manatees
no you have to show mohammad mr president
sir just think about what youre doing to free speech
noo wait you cant listen to him hes a lying deceitful monster who only wants family guy off the air
you cant do what he wants just because hes the one threatening you with violence
yes people can get hurt thats how terrorism works but if you give into that doug youre allowing terrorism to work do the right thing here
do the right thing mr president
i wish that was good enough but if you censor out mohammad then soon youll have to censor out more
if you dont show mohammad then youve made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at and what isnt either its all okay or none of it is
do the right thing show mohammad do the right thing
yes
dick cheney
manbearpig

ow quit it dude
he isnt actually going to show everyone
you know what ill bet it was you
this is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself
yeah try to have everyone make peace so it doesnt seem like a big deal
its too late the treatment would have killed it all
it was him it had to have been him
whats this about cartman
thats retarded you didnt come up with that experiment cartman you saw it in that movie the thing
you saw it in the thing and youre wasting everyones time
nobodys blood is going to jump up in the air
all right fine ill do the dumb test
it doesnt prove anything
no way
wait stop it stop it i cant let kenny be sock-dried
kenny didnt have the head lice all right it was me
i was the one i was too afraid to say anything but i cant let kenny be sock-bathed for it
yeah
what no im sick
dude leave me alone
what why
all right all right
baahir hakeem born in chicago eight years old his favorite color is green car cartman what is this all about
over a hundred
white stripes
what
dude
dude i just got an im from stan that they evacuated the school
i guess so
wuh what doesnt follow
okay
yeah actually there is
theres a hillary clinton campaign rally cartman cartman
so then maybe youre wrong
yeah i cross-referenced his myspace page with realtorcom his parents moved into that green house on janice street
yeah what is that
god damn it cartman
i know something big is going on take a look at this i did a google search for "hillary clinton campaign rally" right and one of the links was to youtube where this russian guy had a bunch of videos
yeah this guy vladimir stolfsky he had videos on youtube of every single rally
no i cross-referenced his youtube profile with myspace and according to his blog hes an old-school communist so whats he doing at every clinton rally
oh thats a good idea
okay i got a text of the russian guys podcast its all a bunch of links to ebay
hey
whats going on
homeland security
ask jeeves nobody uses ask jeeves just google-search it
yes theres a russian guy named vladimir stolfsky whos got search engine hits all over this thing
look we already have the guys blog maybe we can find an address and check it out on mapquest
not anymore youre not
i got it i got it according to paypal the russian guys are just hired mercenaries who had ads up on craigs list and got paid through ebay so that boston could be attacked by the british
all right mapquest the address
good thinking
yeah it just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people because actually most of the world hates us
you didnt save everyone i did you were just out harassing muslims
maybe
that is so missing the point
the-thats not the right way to look at it i-
no not not like youre saying
what happened

well look if being around lots of cash negatively affects the hiv then maybe

yeah here you go
yeah but you know i learned something today we thought we could make money on the internet but while the internet is new and exciting for creative people it hasnt matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue it will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media

some kids think im strange cause i like studying for an exambut i dont let that bother me because its who i am
do what you want dont have restraint
where did everybody go
nah dude are you on americas side stan
butters theres no such thing as vampires
yeah its just so astounding
this is serious theyve been going out for almost two weeks now

arent those the queermos on the disney channel
you want tammy to give you a bj
what kind of protection
kenny arent you a little young for this

yeah but its okay butters they have purity rings now
yup hes in here
weve had just about enough dude youve been blowing us off for two weeks now whats up
its that ring somehow putting on that ring has turned kenny into a boring turd
yeah this all happened the day after he went to that concert
hold tight buddy were gonna find a cure for you
what the hell do you think youre doing spreading this crap to kids
cartman
dow
we came on our own cause our friends purity ring is killing him
well now we know
yeah and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway
dude what
why do you care
whoa what the
hey hey youre that mysterion kid
dude everyones trying to figure out who you are
who me why
well this sucks
you want something new every week fatass
my fault
dont even start dont even start cartman
not because of the jews butters who told you that
now look the reason were in this situation is because people are being stupid the economy isnt some vengeful being that takes things away from us the economy is just made up of people and people have just lost their faith in it what people really should be doing is spending more spending is fine people should just go out and shop they should buy the things they need for their friends and family
whats that
what
whats going on
what did he do
hey hey stop it stop
come on this is ridiculous
ju-just have a little compassion huh i mean everyones gone out and bought something stupid its not so bad whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous go ahead and huck the next squirrel
listen this is all you need to know the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity the economy is just an idea made up by people thousands of years ago the economy is not real and yet it is real nowadays theyll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them i applied for this yesterday to prove a point it is an american express platinum card it has no spending limit do not be afraid this is only plastic its just something made up by people truly meaningless until we put our faith in it faith is what makes an economy exist without faith it is only plastic cards and paper money
i just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this
i cant just hide my whole life butters and besides i have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me
whoever it might happen to be im not giving him the opportunity tomorrow im going to do something something ive known i would have to do restore peoples faith
theres no choice anymore guys dont worry about me ive been preparing for this for a while now
its okay ma
heunh
aww come on
come on guys we gotta go
it was just thirty minutes of two women queefing on people
robbed us of our innocence
calm down butters the men are taking action but we need to take your picture
we know cartman
jimmy exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did cartman write
let me guess you wrote the joke and cartman just laid on the couch eating twizzlers
i knew it dont let that fat turd walk all over you jimmy stand up for yourself
what
craig if cartman didnt do anything then he doesnt deserve any of the credit
no dude screw that jimmy if cartman didnt write the joke then definitely dont sign any patent papers with him just say "cartman you didnt have anything to do with this joke and you know it"
dude get out of here im peeing
you know what cartman i believe you
yes i believe that you believe you helped write that joke thats how people like you work your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself and people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves theyre awesome when really theyre just douchebags
wow you know cartman that is an awesome idea you should totally go to somalia
no im being totally serious that is the best idea youve ever had you should run away to mogadishu you should go there right away ill even help pay for your ticket
nono youre right somalia is an oasis of treasure and waterfalls its totally the pirates life
well c-cause dude im jewish a-and you know
please please let him go
yeah okay and you checked with kenny and tolkien hes not just staying at their houses

oh for sure dude its the most god-forsaken place on the planet things are finally gonna be normal around here
ill call you back
what are you sure
"dear mommy and daddy i am running away i am sorry but i can no longer handle the monotony of middle-class life everyone at school is a fucking idiot and if one more person talked to me about that susan boyle performance of les misérables i was going to puke my balls out through my mouth i love you all but i have to move on im going to somalia to be a-" to be a pirate oh shit
oh god what have i done
no fatass i came to get my brother we all have to get out of here it isnt safe

this isnt paradise and you know it the people here are starving and dying the whole world has used somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste even the fish here are radioactive cartman just give me my brother and let us get out of here
cartman knock it off
they never grow old because they die before theyre 30

ya see ike theres nothing theres nothing for you to be afraid of
its all just in your head ike
i just dont understand it
but dude this doesnt make any sense i mean if you know its going to make you crap blood why wouldnt you at least just try eating less of it

your mom uses chipotlaway to clean blood stains out of your underwear
and then takes you to chipotle and buys you more

butters butters is everything okay
plase sir theyre gonna kill our friend
i think youre awesome funnybot uh but you cant go around taking everyone elses jobs
dude killing everyone isnt funny
wait wait a minute what about a logic loop
ahhh ive seen this before whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies they tell it some kind of paradox to get its processors all tripped out
its working
no problem funnybot
where are you going ike where are you going
i dont know

hmmm yeah
no dude thats not the trailer for terminator 5 that really happened
you get in trouble again cartman
no they didnt
that doesnt make any sense
how big do they say mine is
well everyone has already seen it nothing we can do about it now
didnt you forget something
you measured everyones wiener except for yours
thirteen point seven inches
your wiener is not 13 inches long
dude this is probably the best episode theyve ever done
im so happy
oh no its that super-sad sarah mclachlan commercial look away
dude this is the saddest commercial ever dont watch
why do they have to put this on tv
aaaggh god
i cant take it anymore i gotta go volunteer dude
what exactly can i do to help
oh its its so sad
what are you doing here
what are you doing here
why do you have a video camera
im sorry can i come back in just a little bit
thanks
whats going on
so what are you doing
alright what is it
why do you need me
i knew you were doing something terrible
lots of people will when i tell them
you what
a thousand dollars
theres a big wait to sit down
jesus christ
wow
and it actually helps the crack babies its like volunteering but but we just make a little on the side
hey stan dude i want you to have this its the twenty bucks i owed you plus thirty dollars interest
i got a job stan i am making tons of money doing some really cool stuff
crack baby basketball
no no its n-its not like it sounds here check it out see look we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack its really getting popular i mean it its cool because like the commercial said the crack babies had nothing before it its great because everyone wins you know you see that two million hits did you know theyre putting bacon inside of pancakes at dennys
dude what actually makes total sense about it if you look at it is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need yeah its pretty cool dude because most of these babies would normally not even get out you know huh or be able to do anything just because we are making money doesnt mean that those babies arent benefiting it isnt exploiting them theyre finding a useful place in society whats so unethical about that
ooogh dude the thing is were not the ones that made them crack babies thats their moms goddamned fault
i do not sound like cartman goddamnit okay so see ya
i need to talk to you
in our deal with ea sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names but we arent paying the crack babies
but this video game can make a million dollars we have to give the crack babies a piece of that
gut theyre the ones risking injury
the government could come after us cartman
so then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an internet ad to payless shoe source go
a hot tub
gravy
no way
i know but dude we cant license our games to ea sports and pay the crack babies nothing slavery is illegal
what other companies
heres the thing whether or not im a part of it crack baby basketball is popular somebodys going to do it so the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it so that i can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies oh its sooo easy for you isnt it i mean what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today or what you want to watch on tv tomorrow well sorry skippy but the world isnt always black and white just because some people are born poorer than others doesnt mean i cant enjoy a few mcdonalds french fries in a hot tub of gravy from kentucky fried chicken
it happens to be called poutine in montreal
alright cartman ive been doin a lot of thinking about how the companys gonna spend the money we make off the ea sports deal were going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies
ive designed it to be the best place for them to live a place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve and if you think its a bad idea i really dont care
what
and so thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with ea sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies did you see the blueprints the babies will have their own putt putt golf course why does it matter how much im making stan if the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop why does my salary matter
what
look lets just get our money from ea sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all
wait a minute according to this you now own all the rights to crack baby basketball and we got nothing
you cant do this we were gonna build an orphanage so the crack babies have somewhere to go
you guys weve just been screwed over and lied to
its unbelievable stan ea sports just used us the entire time we worked for nothing and ea made all the money you know i dont think we actually deserved getting screwed over but but i guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems i know i know right we mightve got screwed but the really tragic thing is that those those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there with nowhere to go no way this is it
this is it stan its just like i designed it theres the miniature gold course over there and slides and uh excuse me what is this place
but who paid for all this
you dont think that- but he isnt real
wait wait it-its stans birthday
oh god
here this ones from me stan
yeah dude
yeah theyre the best
but thats our music we like it
gross
oh dude dude this is the part i was talking about check out the bassline on this

if someone says they saw a sasquatch they are either lying or they are stupid now stop lying about a jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you
would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth
these people arent going to prove anything to believe any of this you either have to be a liar or stupid
what are you doing
admit youre lying and ill let you go
yes its because the pharaoh wont give the hebrews what we want god is angry
thats how god is and if pharaoh doesnt give us what we want next hes gonna kill all egyptian first born boys
it doesnt matter because god is going to harden the pharaohs heart
it means jehovah is going to use his powers to keep the pharaoh from letting us go
thats just how god is
this is what god told us to do
youll see
yeah
i know youre not
happy passover cartman

what you were waiting for me in the bathroom
look this is all getting way too big tell the movie studio you arent selling the video to them
if it needs to be seen by everybody then why dont you put it out on the internet for free well

that fat turd up there is the one who set up you and tolkien cause he thinks blacks belong together
we dont have kickoffs anymore

thats not what i meant by doing something about it cartman
what
so take a shit somewhere else
you have got to be kidding me
we should not be wasting time and money making sure cartmans fat scooter cant be tipped over
so get off your fucking scooters and pick them up
whos honey boo boo
jesus dude w-w-what happened its like somethings lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore
come on hurry it up in there
this has gone far enough how can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us
yeah weve gotta raise peoples awareness
yeah guh a a documentary
you i gu-i guess youre kinda right
really thanks dude im gonna go get a video camera
ladies and gentlemen we have an epidemic in our country obesity is costing taxpayers millions and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed over the past several days i have filmed such a case and the shocking video has been edited by my partner tolkien it is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue
fatty doo doo
what
what have you done
when we said "documentary" i thought we meant 60 minutes not honey boo boo
you got randy newman to do the theme song youre not trying that hard tolkien youre a good kid how can you sit there and collect money on a show thats about a about a fat child killing himself wheres your sense of shame
when the bar gets lowered tolkien we all pay the price what if honey boo boo was a little black girl being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy
i just dont know what to do i mean i hate cartman with all my heart but i cant stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him but should i feel ashamed oh whatever lowered the bar is not my fault so if i kind of go with it is it really unfair to cartman
just you know make some money off him like honey boo boo
what
what oh my god
im sorry tolkien i had to tell him his life is in danger
you found a network to buy it
ive been thinking how did shamelessness get to this did it start with fat people on scooters or did the bar get lowered way before that and then i started thinking maybe it was us i dont know but maybe somehow we lowered the bar a long time ago and now were all sittin here in the stink of it all theres no going back stan
huh
i dont know i think weve been given another chance

larry and brad stoltsky
those xbox ones are as good as ours
yeah
look guys we all have to agree on one system
if some of us are on ps4s but the rest of us are on xboxs then we all cant play together online see this is all about committing to one machine
no the xboxs are gonna be better
no we cant divide like this stan youre on our side right
stan the ps4 doesnt have the seamless transition between games movies and tv offered by xbox one
then i guess ill see you on black friday
i know
i dont know
this isnt helping us butters
yeah but why cant xbox automatically let you pre-order metal gear solid v
cartman we should probably talk about our chances
its not enough ever since kenny switched sides there are more kids that wanna go with ps4 on black friday
sony released the ps4s cartman theyre being reviewed people are liking them
if you want to make sure im not switching sides cartman you dont have to worry stan is wrong
grounded for what
no cartman you said nobody will have to be grounded were not playing dirty
what
stan this has gone too far people are going to get hurt what you started is way out of control
all these people are going to be gaming on xbox you really wanna just game with craig the rest of your life
cartman hes got everyone on sonys side we cant stop him
this would have never happened if you would have let kenny be a princess in the first place
well unfortunately for us hes now on the other side we are out of options
i have an idea i dont like it but i think its the only choice we have
go ahead and tell him cartman
look the truth is we all have a bigger problem now and you know it nobody is going to get anything if we dont work together against those thousands of other shoppers
red robin can be rented out for wedding parties if we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there
lets do this together dude our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up if you wanna game on a ps4 then i do too
i swear stan
cartman cartman i heard that stan somehow found out about our plan
well what the hell are you doing this isnt gonna work now
what the hell did you do
no tell me you didnt
thanks mrs marsh
ok-okay stan stan
stan its me
dude i know youre pissed at me right now youve gotta understand that i did it because i know in my heart that the xbox is better for all of us
you werent playing fair dude getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasnt fair
you didnt
im sorry stan im sorry this whole war has just got us all so screwed up i just want us to be playing call of duty on the right machine
stan dont say that
princess kenny i believe its time we returned the wizards hospitality
im sorry cartman theres been a little change in plans
i am no longer an xbox guy i let my friend get grounded but today i will give him a playstation
the fight is over cartman
wait a minute ha-how the hell did these two guys end up here
no theyre not a part of your betrayal
stan
cartman your side won dude why are you so sad
yeah clearly annie nelson is the hottest girl at our school look at those eyes
barking vaginal belch
bloody butt cough
how are we supposed to name our startup company if every name is already taken
it doesnt quite roll off the tongue
yeah thats why we wanna have a startup company
what tell us
washington redskins
what
wait guys this this doesnt seem legal
yeah i just well i just thought our company name would be more like uh or-original
yeah but maybe we need a name thats more affirming like shows what we stand for
im just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to
no way
guys we need to talk to you i really dont think we wanna be a company that isis looks up to we should maybe issue a statement saying that we dont sanction them
people arent gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we dont care about anything
thats the catholic church
thats the nfl
all right i really dont want to have to do this but im not happy with the direction this company is taking
maybe ill start my own company
i dont want to its a stupid name
yeah i guess i guess everything is
its so awesome dude our company already has a hundred backers and we still have 14 days to go
you okay bro
give it time itll grow on you
because that sounds like we dont have anything weve been through this already stan
well whattaya mean
oh well i certainly dont want you to feel that "furry balls plopped menacingly on the table" is holding you back
yeah good luck with yours
what the hell is wrong "cant find the server" kickstarter
what
no i just cant get it to load
my company was on kickstarter too why would i get rid of it
hes right we should do a merger
yes we do we have a sweet name i was wrong cartman "washington redskins" is the perfect name i think maybe i was jealous that i didnt come up with it
whattaya say cartman
when kickstarter went down many saw their startup projects die but here at washington redskins we saw opportunity people still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects and with the redskins you can now go fund yourself and the idea is simple you the people go out and raise all your own money and give the washington redskins 5%
what the heck is that
change our name
when was that
well what the hell do we do
hey guys
sup jason
oh tha-oh yeah the the startup company thing didnt really work out
we were- trying to be funny
doesnt anyone understand the significance of "im sorry" anymore
well i guess lets just be thankful were not butters they wont even let him come back to school
i dont know what were going to do its been like four hours and people still wont talk to us
dude that would have to be like the best party ever
hey that might work but it cant be a party for us
no no hes right weve gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go
a band holy shit stan didnt you say your dad knows somebody who knows lorde
yeah its going to be this weekend
nope were gonna have all the pizza you can eat twenty different cakes and lorde is going to play live

thats terrible
are you happy now
is is this do you think this is cool
see when you start invading peoples privacy eh thinking its harmless to put up pictures of them they didnt want up - kenny - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody
i was in the bathroom when you were talking to butters cartman i know what-

you have your crutches
youre saying these games do this on purpose
sure come on guys
we have to find a way to get the word out people need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems there has to be a way that we can get to the news company and sneak in and somehow borrow their tv signal if we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous then-

what
youre lying
how is that gay
youre talking to kyle right now
youre the one who said ninjas were gay why do you wanna make this a problem
im right here
nobody ever gave a shit you fat pig
oh shit
oh jesus now what
was what me sir
what
knock it off
go get my pen fatass
go get my pen
goddammit
wheres pc principal
what are you talking about
"principal sends two favorite students on a disney cruise this week students jimmy valmer and leslie meyers are being treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation for their outstanding school-" what the hell is this
yeah i ah i dont wanna get involved
ive already learned you cant win against pc principal you should know of all people since he converted your dad
who told you that the principal sent jimmy on a disney cruise
there leslies instagram and her twitter last entry was ten days ago
jimmy never used that stuff remember he said he hated using the internet
im just looking for any news articles or anything about pc principal where did you say pc principal was from
maybe theres something from the news in vermont that could give us a clue about- goddammit what the hell is this
dude dude look at this "how pc culture is changing vermont from a state of intolerance to a s-" dude there it is again
its that goddamned guitar this ad is fucking following me
im trying goddammit get over here
it is pretty cool dude it tunes itself
its this company that does all kinds of hi-tech instruments see look ill show you
oh sorry wrong arrow button
so then whatd tolkien say
whoa what the hell just happened
we were we were on cartmans computer looking up news stories about pc principal
its like someones trying to distract us because theyre worried what well uncover about pc people
why are you looking at me
well what are you guys talking about
what
and why do you think that stan
because if anyone has a reason for us not mess with pc principal its you lets not forget that stans dad is pc principals little bitch
it is you isnt it thats why youre trying to shift the blame on me thats very cartman of you stan
n-ho thats good just keep on distracting everybody it seems to be working cartman
leslie
how do you know thi-
2692
butters get to the bathroom now
jimmys dead
i know the whole story pc principal killed him and tried to kill leslie but she got away
pc principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesnt follow their pc ideology
because leslies with me im keeping her safe
it gets worse someone in this town helped these people come here that person faked the bill cosby joke to get principal victoria fired
i think its obvious stans dad
stan your dad is one of them he had to be the one to let them in
theres no way to know who we can trust
theres only one thing we can do we have to get guns
its the only way for us to be safe
you guys lay low and watch your backs im gonna go keep leslie protected
are you okay
here
dont worry leslie i wont let anything happen to you
leslie we dont know who is on their side we have to stay safe
i gave up giving speeches
im sure id have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side
not if we go somewhere thats completely safe from any violence
the gun show
therell be so many guns that nothing bad can happen
dont listen to them the real conspiracy here are the pc extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesnt think like they do you son of a bitch stan how could you have sided with the enemy
jimmy
you told me jimmy was dead
i think they called it german collective guilt right where even the germans who just did nothing while hitler rose to power were were maybe somehow also responsible
but i cant control what cartman does so so why should i feel ashamed for what cartman does
i dont think the answer to all this is member berries
agh never mind im just gonna stay out of it
what the hell are you doing
you really think youre fooling anyone with this fake persona everyone knows youre acting this way by day so you can be horrible to people on the internet at night
i dont really care just dont drag me into it
goddammit do you guys even care how this makes the girls feel
we all know who did and if we dont do something then the girls will eventually retaliate against us
i didnt know vagina had balls
youre just trying to start a war arent you
its not gonna work cartman im not gonna let you divide boys and girls in this school anymore when this whole thing comes to an end youre gonna be all on your own
yeah
what are you doing here
im going to the bathroom
they sat it out because you were harassing them online
why would you care
if we could just prove who the troll was then the girls wouldnt be wanting a war would they
just know this cartman im going to prove who skankhunt42 is whatever it takes everyone is going to know and skankhunt is gonna pay for everything hes ever said
yeah dad just thinkin
dude whats going on
hear what what happened
oh no
shell get back on
the girls want to see cartman punished so we have to prove its him
yeah but not like wed actually do it
stan you cant be thinking that wed-
are we seriously talking about doing this
were almost there
just put your stuff on the table and step back
what we had to do
whats going on
hear what
no thats impossible
oh my god oh my god
no uh he quit
he probably got fed up with all the negativity and decided to end it i dont know
okay that was the cops the cops were here
but we were wrong
dad can i talk to you
all the girls at school are really mad its like one guy gets online and says terrible things about girls and it reflects badly on all of us
everyones sad everyones depressed and nobody knows how to move forward
i guess what im saying is im starting to feel a lot of guilt just for being a boy how do i not feel that
guys ive been thinking this over a lot and we need to be more active in showing the girls that we respect them theres a big girl-volleyball game tonight and we should all go and show our support

cartman i did some research on the danish web site youve been helping out you do realize that once trolltrace is online anybody can use it on anyone right
so somebody like heidi could use it to see your entire internet history everything you ever said and did on the internet even before you were together
right but somebody like me could look up your entire internet history print it out and give it to heidi i would imagine theres some things youve done or said on the internet you wouldnt want heidi to know about
its available to everyone stupid

nnnothing

butters butters you cant just make stuff up about us people are thinking its true
dude what a dick
its so unfair
coon everybody hates us

bwa dadadadadadadada bam
dude you cant do a prequel first
cause then its not a prequel its just first and besides tupperware isnt our strongest character
tolkien
did any of you guys actually see the witch
they say she blew up the pumpkin patch did any of you guys see that
no weve got to just hope the police will handle it
check this out you guys it says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits nine in all each bent into an l shape
nobodys talking about getting rid of heidi
of the witch
then break up with her you clearly cant stand her let the poor girl go
heidi is a nice girl how could you be so awful to her
dad get out of here were trying to deal with an actual witch nobodys coming after you
no i i dont know where he is
how are we gonna do that
who
thats enough cartman i am so sick of hearing you call heidi horrible things
i dont get it i just really dont get it how is she still supporting him
but he clearly sucks she has to know he sucks what the hell is going on
it is our problem this is affecting us our whole school theres got to be a reason she sticks by him
oh heidi heidi you got a sec
hey uh listen uh i-i know you and cartman have an anniversary coming up and i was just wondering you know um how do you think hes doing aaas a boyfriend
well you know like some of us are thinking that uh maybe hes not super-qualified to be with you
just like what are the things about cartman that you find remotely redeeming
you dont have to get defensive i just-
i didnt say "i told you-"
wooow
guys listen i think i know why heidi wont admit cartmans a horrible boyfriend
yeah its important
we have to help that girl cant you see whats happening
youre wrong in a way i think were all going out with cartman right now
hello i know things have been difficult between us lately i know you think all boys are sort of pigs but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful not not like hot-beautiful i mean like inside-beautiful i im not saying youre hot youre not youre not hot im not saying youre ugly it doesnt matter- youre all hot on the inside if we could all just see inside you it would be hot oh shit
its heidi turner you guys shouldnt criticize her so much for going with cartman
i know i i know that okay trust me i hate cartman as much as any of you but just give her some space you know you cant keep on saying "we told you so" because if you make her feel dumb she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasnt dumb
no
no i dont do i
yeah no were not getting involved with that
yeah no yeah i uh dya i think we need to stay out of it
butters\toh okay then
cartman can we talk
i just i hope that maybe you can realize what you have with heidi and and just try to be good to her okay
you doin okay heidi
heidi people like cartman they always make things someone elses fault we all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes but cartman sees himself as the victim all the time hell always find someone to blame for his shortcomings and because of that hes never gonna change
no heidi good people make bad decisions every day
cartman i didnt mean for things to happen the way they did
cartman you werent happy
all you did was bitch about her all the time
come on cartman i-
stop it
im sorry cartman you just have to accept that heidis moved on
hey you all set to go
okay sure
yeah thats understandable
what do you mean
but heidi i thought-
dude did she just call me a dirty jew
actually some of their projects are pretty cool
uh hey hey hey what the hell are you all doing
guys guys this has gone on way too long cant we all stop being so mean to each other
for the first time i feel kind of bad for the person being farted on
vice principal woman
my names kyle and ive been doing a lot of changing lately i came because i might be able to offer some insight into our problem here
you see theres a culture at this school that embraces meanness and i believe now that it comes from a canadian tv show all the boys watch it i did too we all laughed while they farted on innocent peoples heads the thing is i never felt for the person being farted on until now i want to work with you to open peoples eyes because i get it now
what
but but i thought for sure you would be on my side
what doh forget it
rrrrr
thanks for having me tom
all im saying is that theres a culture that originates from canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now
im saying were all guilty too i grew up watching terrance & phillip and i thought it was funny
no it was never funny i see it differently now
we dont wanna censor it we just wanna get rid of it
oh see thats what im talking about right there that kind of mean degrading canadian trash
canadians should care about the rest of the world
maybe i will
maybe i know the president
stop calling me that
thats all you know is how to be mean-
because you were all raised on it yourselves
alright thats it everyone stop were shutting it down we are millennials against canada we demand this kind of bullying canadian entertainment be stopped
good give it here yes hello this is the leader of millennials against canada
oh im sorry im taking a stand and doing something i realize this doesnt gel with your nihilism
im not like my mom im gonna make a difference its gonna feel real good
the national guard
yes this is millennials against canada
we cant do that mr president someone has to do whats right
what do i want i want a world where laughter doesnt come at someone elses expense where people can live freely without fear of being farted on i want a world where you arent ridiculed for trying to help a world where a nice girl that i liked isnt turned into another eric cartman these canadians are in the way of that world and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the earth
ike ike im sorry that i caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on canada i was just- you know i was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down you know those shows can be really harmful
whats going on
who did
you saw the president
its my fault ike went to go take matters into his own hands i have to find him
i dont need anyone to go with me
i would never have the hots for the person you are now
we need to keep going guys
ike ike
can we go please
here it is ike
hes not here either
you dont understand canadians theyre fiercely loyal to their country when canada is attacked they all join in the fight
oh my god look these are ikes toy binoculars he was here ike
the six by the four
yeah tolkiens probably sick of you cheating off him all the time
oh theres butters

butters you know you can just bring your priest with you everywhere i mean sometimes the guys just wanna do stuff and not have a priest around

four bikes one common theme
ill start looking for costumes what theme are we thinking
theres no time lets face it we cant be in the bike parade
oh yeah the mall
theres nobody here
are you the only one still at the mall
i think maybe it was a bad idea to come here you guys
yeah and the four of us are actually doing a group theme
yehehes yeessss
i got fulfilled its all the stuff i ordered for the bike parade yeah
no dad these were special deliveries from jeff bezos we helped amazon with their strike and he had our orders shipped
yeah we helped him find workers to work during the strike
so he found our orders and had them sent to us
they look amazing
all right kennys here come on dude were gonna take em for a test spin
well why not
kenny you cant quit now we have a four-bike theme
hows it look like its going theres no way were going to win this stupid bike parade
face it stan our bikes suck were gonna lose were gonna be the laughingstock of the whole thing
i wish there never was a bike parade
whats offensive about a bike parade
oh i get it
i cant believe kenny bailed on us just because he thinks jeff bezos is a bad guy
such bullcrap
no no the problem is that when it comes to outrage your average person actually doesnt give a shit unless it has something to do with them
kenny was right about you youre a bad guy
why are you doing this
what do you want
yeah cause you were gonna snap her bra
fuck you
are you done now can i hang up
hello
mom dad
goddamit cartman
here
no im jewish
im just here because some fat intolerant asshole didnt want me around
what about all the other kids when do they get to go home
my people arent you worried about what youre creating here
youre pulling children away from their parents and isolating them behind bars
youre traumatizing them and teaching them to fear the us government
okay let me try to put this in terms you people will understand you know superhero movies right
okay you remember how they always create the villain some random person who when they were a child got taken from their parents and locked away and the kid was just left to sit and plot revenge what youre doing here is creating a mexican joker and whats a mexican joker gonna do hes gonna grow up and have memories of being wronged by you and he will grow and wait and then finally fight back with a passion unlike anything youve ever seen
no it could be any of them thats the point you dont know which kid in there is gonna snap from being separated and locked down like this
mexican joker doesnt care when that kid grows up all that will matter is getting back at all of you
what the fuck are you doing here
i havent seen my parents in *two weeks* nobody even knows where my little brother is
wait i have an idea how to get everyone out of here get everyones aluminum foil and some scissors
just do it before i kill you
shema israel adonai eloheinu adonai ehad
goddamnit nobody here is mexican joker thats not what i meant the future is not set we make decisions now that affect our future
no
anything happen while we were gone
were just saying butters that sometimes it all seems a little codependent
