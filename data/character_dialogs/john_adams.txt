aye
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one penis to rise up- -we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honorps - every thursday should be free ice cream day
we have no choice mr dickinson
we must go to war
we cannot found a country that is afraid to fight
its like having your cake and eating it too
