im good you
christopher ive come to ask you to stop what youre doing
using stem cells is like playing god you should leave nature alone
im saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards youre dealt christopher
chris thats enough
youre cured chris its time to stop using stem cells
theyre affecting your mind chris if you wont stop using stem cells then well stop you
not so fast chris
we just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research your fetus-sucking days are over
and now were going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again
