hmm… i really so no resemblance between that song and "stinky britches" by our artist alanis morissette
i am above the law
mr chef i’m afraid you leave me no alternative we’re going to sue you
yes i suggest you get a real good lawyer we’ll have the best in the business
and that chair too i want that chair
you heard the judge since you lost the case i can seize whatever i want to pay my legal fees yeah take that water cooler too
take this too
i can take whatever i want
i am above the law
i told you not to mess with me
you wouldn’t
that doesnt matter because that money belongs to me
i am above the law
what are you bastards doing
oh yeah we’ll just see about this
we’ll just see how long this chef aid thing lasts
