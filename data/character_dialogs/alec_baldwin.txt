hello im alec baldwin and i love social media but sometimes i accidentally tweet things that are homophobic i dont think that way i just type that way thats when i realized it wasnt me that was homophobic it was my thumbs and they needed to be gotten rid of so then the problem was i dont have thumbs but i know that everyone in america still wants to hear everything i have to say well thats okay because now theres a device that can actually take the thoughts in your head and send them directly to the internet its called shitter wires are grafted harmlessly into your skull and any thought you have is uploaded to the internet and on to all your shitter followers dont let your social media slow down our need to communicate with the world go direct from thought to internet with shitter
