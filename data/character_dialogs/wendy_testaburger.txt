hi guys
here stan this is for you

but why stan
eww

nice of you to show up we were just discussing how we should state our case
what
cartman we cant just attack stan and kyles credibility we need to present our side of the debate
the south park flag
daaaaahhh
this might come in handy it says here that recently a case was brought before the south carolina court about their flag and they-
if we could show a parallel between the south carolina case-
cartman why dont you just go home you arent helping any
thats because youre stupid and youre a racist
i cant believe it all the pressures on us i mean this debate is going to actually affect the outcome of the vote
oh man weve got to come up with rebuttals to the history argument
huh
hey thats a pretty good point cartman
not bad at all i may make that our first argument
double-stuffed cookies are my favorite

oh well you wanna maybe go to the art museum
what
mom dad im growing concerned about the role models young women have in todays society
it seems that lewdness and shallowness are being exalted while intellectualism is looked down upon
i think young women are being marketed to by corrupt moral-less corporations

dad
hey bebe i heard you were having a party tonight
im a stupid spoiled whore

of course stan
this is a nice surprise i thought you were never speaking to me again
which one we make lists all the time
well personally i didnt vote him the ugliest my vote was for eric cartman but enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
change the list do you have any idea what that would take maybe you dont understand how important list-making is to girls its not just something we do flippantly theres protocol
all right ill try and get you into our next list-making meeting but it wont be easy
if it pleases and sparkles i would like to suggest that we that we reopen last weeks list for debate
go ahead
he didnt mean that he was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion
wait a minute wait stan i think ive got something take a look at this during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy seven girls gave clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle
it doesnt add up it is possible that rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list
hey rebecca do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys looks
i know but i think theres been a mistake six of the girls ive talked to didnt vote clyde the cutest that means that mathematically he should have been-
nonorary chair mrs secretary i believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists ive compiled a full report and it turns out that nobody voted clyde the cutest in the class i believe rebecca changed the list to make him number one
right after the list was made rebecca started going out with clyde you can read all the discrepancies here we need to remake that list
uh what do you mean call the girls in
you knew
so that you all could justify dating clyde and get shoes how dare you take advantage of your position im gonna tell bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee
no not bebe
when the other girls find out you ignored their votes theyre gonna-
i dont think so
stan run
what
youve compromised everything our lists integrity
it doesnt matter how incredible they are you cant- oh my god those are amazing
is that a lace across the top
oh but it doesnt matter you took it too far
its too late bebe ive already made a full report and sent a copy to the police people will know
stan its been really great hanging out with you again i feel like youve changed somehow in a really awesome way
thanks stan
look stan they had beef jerky back then
whats going on
over here this looks like an office

hey look

we dont care what other people wear or the way they like to style their hair
hey stan

stan thats ridiculous
i would never leave you for bridon

what day
god theyre so stupid
whats going on
its when a woman blows air out her vag annie
wait a minute ive got an idea
hey guys we have a little surprise for you
and hes not fat at all
you saved everyone from the jewbots cartman
leave me alone
stan
is what true
i dont have time for this
try to understand this all i do is try to help run student council i dont give a crap about smurfs
maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you
i really dont care stan
im not giving eric fartman one minute of my time you got that im not acknowledging his stupid questions if you want him dealt with youll have to do it yourself
hey what are you doing
its okay dad ill take care of it
yeah well butters peed on my house
if we could just keep it to questions about student council
sure
okay
i dont i i have no idea what-
i believe there is a few things wrong with the school but-
look eric you have to understand the smurfberries were our school governments only option
what was i supposed to do the school was running out of power we tried relocating the smurfs at first but they wouldnt budge so we decided to get somebody on the inside a member of the school who could act like one of the smurfs and learn their secrets but of course you know that dont you
im just asking a question we all knew you were sent in to live with the smurfs but did you know they would be wiped out
nobody expected you to fall in love with smurfette you went to learn from them but instead you became one of them right fought against your own kind when you knew wed stop at nothing do you know that one smurfberry can power the school for two months one smurfberry
no its okay its all out in the open now i wouldnt have had to kill the smurfs if they would have simply moved on but you gave them the will to stay and i guess you cant be blamed for that
and that is why im stepping down you were right all along cartman and i am hereby making you the student body president
no youre right the students all deserve to know the truth and so i have answered what really happened in my new book going rogue on the smurfs
luckily with the money i made selling the movie rights to my book ill be okay
james cameron go look the movie came out already
am i a joke to you
i just wanna know is that all i am a big joke
you do have a facebook page stan
yeah well i saw your page stan relationship status single
you like being single stan so that you could facebook to find other girls according to your facebook page we arent friends
and youd better change your relationship status to "in a relationship"
by editing your profile under "basic information"
"i think you look cute in your bunny costume"
"i think you look cute in your bunny costume" what is that supposed to mean
thats what susan92 wrote on your facebook wall you give girls pictures of you in bunny outfits fuck you
yes ive read all about it its a real disease its called "hoarding" people who cant throw anything away and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just cant take it anymore
stan we need to talk about your locker
every time i see the condition its in i j-i just wanna cry it just keeps getting messier and messier i think you have a problem
its so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything and lately youve been asking to keep things in my locker
no stan its called "hoarding" and if you dont get help i dont know how much longer i could be with you
then can we throw some stuff in your locker away
okay ive hired some experts to help you with this well make this as easy as possible on you stan
stan did you find out the reason youve been hoarding
thank god
this isnt fair how can the school make us get vaccinated
hey kyle have you heard anything at all from stan
i dont know what to do its like hes completely turned off
look maybe what we should do is all go over to his house together an-and that way we could-
you like looking at girls butt cracks stan
do you have any idea how embarrassed i am
so you didnt e-mail anybody else about elise thompsons butt crack right
specially when theyre writing about your boyfriends addiction to crack
of course a kid could use the computer in there and nobody would know
oh hes really nice nichole i dated him for a little while
oh you mean kyle
oh butters you know how i feel about the captain of sports teams
unless we come together as a country and realize that refugees from syria should be considered in need-
refugees from syria should be considered in need of international protection
the vast majority of refugees from syria are likely to meet refugee status criteria and issued benefits from-
instead of booing my opinion why dont you make a constructive argument
mr garrison can you do something about this please mr garrison
ugh jesus
this is the result of a broken society in which profits come before morals
i have to agree with cartman maybe we overreacted when our parents-
cheer squad roll call
you guys stop it okay lisa thats great but you need to have more confidence okay
what
see thats the problem lisa you have a bad self-image just project all your sassiness to all the boys out there okay
but lisa thats great have you told butters that you like him
lisa this is exactly what you need take butters to see a movie or something itll do wonders for your confidence
what the fuck is your problem
are you just an asshole is that it
yeah
lisa berger asked you out and you called her fat do you have any idea how you made her feel shes a really nice girl
shes a little overweight but thats pretty normal for a girl in the fourth grade
what
this is a fantasy you moron you ever heard of photoshop kim kardashian is a short overweight woman who manipulates her image and makes average girls feel horrible about themselves
look it up stupid in real life kim kardashian has the body of a hobbit youre gonna be in real trouble when the teachers find out what you said to that poor girl
oh good lisa berger told on you good
are you serious
thats not his girlfriend its kim kardashian
right but shes not in real life shes a hobbit
im not "jel" and i happen to be the biggest feminist at this school
butters butters come here for a sec
butters will you please let me show you something so we can put this behind us
i want you to see just how easy this is so we can better understand each other this is lisa bergers class photo right
now first thing we do is photoshop the bulges on her sides we select the eyes make them a nicer shape take off any blemishes on the skin lengthen the neck add more to the hair select the lips and make them fuller take out any puffiness on the skin here add fullness to the breasts lengthen the torso take away that fold of skin streamline the shoulders put highlights in the eyes and there
do you see what im talking about
thats how people like kim kardashian destroy the self-mage of little girls everywhere
what what do you mean
butters
excuse me
why would i be jel
shes not hot thats supposed to be the point
lisa berger is not hot shes fat and ugly
im sorry its nothing personal lisa
i am not jelly i made that picture of you to prove a point and its being taken the wrong way
mr mackey i was trying to show kids that-
jelly school
mr mackey i appreciate the point youre trying to make
yes im im a few steps ahead of that yes
thank you mr mackey i will change
cheer squad roll call
and im your captain wendy
i wont do it you guys im sorry
because its wrong if you guys arent happy with the way you look then thats your problem
what
so you want a photoshopped picture of me to take away any imperfections is that it how dare you stan
because people should be okay with the way they look i have pimples on my forehead my bottom teeth are crooked so what you have short legs
yeah and jason has freckles and billy turner has narrow shoulders the cheerleaders bebe has acne lolas arms are too short nicholes eyes are puffy annie has thin hair and heidi turners butt is flat oh god damn it
ugh
wendy
lets just get back to cheering okay
see the problem with having fake pictures of yourself is that you start to believe in your own bullshit this has gone way too far and if society wont fix it i will
something that should have been done a long time ago
watching what photoshop is doing to society little girls are aspiring to have bodies they cant possibly have we have to put a stop to it
nooo
not lately no
no that has nothing to do with me wanting to protest against photoshopped images
thats not a jelly school thats a dunkin donuts
thats fine people can call me whatever names they want to i dont care there is a cancer in our country and im not going to rest until photoshopped images are required to be labeled for what they are fake and nothing in this world is going to stop me
agh what do you want
ah ah im sorry im sorry that i have been jelly
no no ive been a hater and i really am sorry
youre back
oh wow im shocked
you broke up with me stan you said you had to be "free to chase your dreams"
is that why you told clyde that you broke up with me because youre about to be "dripping in bitches"
im happy stan im happy i know who you really are now youre someone who cant be counted on youre someone who can just bail on the people you love
why are you doing this party stan was it because you made people mad at school or because you just wanted to be a big shot
so then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on em im pretty sure scott malkinson still has diabetes
you couldnt put on the party you were hoping to put on was that it
right and when things change or things come up you dont forget about everything you promised people
thought so
yeah sure you guys really pulled it off
youre so transparent stan
you wanna dance
what the hell do you think youre doing
this is the girls bathroom
what
get out of here
cartman is using our bathroom
eric there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all youre doing is-
that isnt fair
hey guys
hows it hanging
its cool ill wait
yeah i heard the girls volleyball team won by like 20 points
yeah you should show your support too sometime
hey guys these games coming up are really big and it would mean a lot to us if you could try and make it thanks

is this a joke
im not doing it
hey guys as you know we have several new students here at south park elementary we have been getting to know some of the asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called "yaoi" yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon the art tries to show that all love is magical like in lisa akimotos piece "tweek and craig - forbidden love"
kelly zhou goes a bit more whimsical with "craig and tweek moonlight dance"
in yaoi art the seme or "top" is usually dominating the uke or "bottom" as demonstrated in heather nishimuras "boizu rabu"
but yaoi can branch out to other things as well
as we see here in "lily frog tweek and craig"
tweek
it is him its completely obvious and nobody is doing anything about it
im not funny
i dont feel like being funny right now
it has to be swift and serious we have to make a statement the girls in south park arent going to be treated like afterthoughts anymore
oh my godi dont know if i can go through with this

they took their wieners out
this was an attack on us this is exactly why we sat out the national anthem in the first place

he is stupid look at him
heidi
\thow is this our fault at least we actually did the work
what do you want kyle
is it just me or are things around here getting worse and worse
people change they say you become more and more like the person youre with and i guess its true with heidi
heidi are you okay its just you look
ngh you know y-you just look-
its not exactly like being a slave heidi
just dont even respond to her just ignore her
watching heidi get her bitch-ass kicked
you wanna trick or treat with us why
oh you jerks found out the girls are all trick or treating on e-scooters and you stole our idea
we asked for healthier options and to sometimes have food for those of us who dont eat red meat
everyone everyone can i have your attention please look guys were supposed to be the young generation right were the ones upset about the world our parents left us
the millions and millions of cows and pigs and chickens that we harvest every year are a huge reason for climate change
without sustainable and ethical food choices now were proving to be no d-
hello
mr principal sir can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day
mr principal we really didnt do anything wrong
oh fuck

we all have to be on the same page here
we apologize you guys want a chance to save pajama day then join us in telling mr garrison were all sorry
at school tomorrow we all tell mr garrison he was right and that weve been terrible students that we werent listening and that he deserves to be angry with us we tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher
we just have to be brave
remember no matter how angry he is tell him hes right
"this is"
