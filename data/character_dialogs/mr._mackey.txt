mkay kids uh we have some news uh theres been a terrible flood in oklahoma mkay so the 4-million-recorder-childrens event is being moved to arkansas
eh the trip shouldnt take any longer but ill hand out these updated contact sheets so that your parents will know where you are mkay
mkay
what we cant find anybody to fill in for you why cant you go to arkansas
well dont you want to see them
uh perhaps you should sit down mr garrison mkay mr garrison i know this is very difficult mkay but i must ask is there a history of sexual abuse in your family
when was that
mkay eh and your father he molested you when you were a boy mr garrison i think when we get to arkansas you need to see your father you need to face this demon in your closet mkay
mkay
mr garrison are you alright
mkay-mr garrison youre just having a hard time dealing with the memories of your fathers sexual abuse so you switch personalities to mr hat mkay
mkay-i think the best thing for mr garrison to do is to go see his father
mkay mr hat you need to let me talk to mr garrison mkay
what did you say
why you son of a bitch
im gonna kick your ass mkay
yuh-no you may have won this time mr hat
mkay i want everyone to stay together mkay nobody move
excuse me
oh uh were from south park colorado
uh mr garrison sr
uh my name is mr mackey im your school counselor mkay
uh-i wanna talk to you about your son—im his n-therapist mkay
eh you didnt
oh hm uh i guess thats a little different
well now uh whats he supposed to think mr garrison i mean uh look at all the media all the magazine ads and television ads talkin about "sexual molestation" mkay he sees all that and assumes you didnt molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality
i know i know but im afraid this problem has run very deep through mr garrisons mental state im worried that if you dont do something well it could kill him
there comes a time in every fathers life when he must ask himself "how far will i go to save my sons life"
well ive said all i can say i know its difficult but family is about compromises mkay dont lose your son over this mr garrison dont lose your son mkay
uh arent those our boys
alright come on everybody weve got a long bus ride back to colorado mkay
uh queef is a vaginal expulsion of gas mkay
and what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior young man mkay
well i hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad eric
not this time eric youve got to learn to respect your little friends youre gonna have detention for two weeks
yes way mkay and that settles it now lets all go-
yes
nn-um mkay uh ive already taken care of it eric cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention
uh oh but i dont think this is a ruh-
oh no
uh young man if you dont wanna be held back a grade i suggest you start cooperating mkay
huh- hold on just a second there principal victoria i think i may know what the problem is
yes of course
i think maybe timmy is suffering from something called "attention deficit disorder" or add its very common in kids his age
it should be easy enough to find out they have tests for that kind of thing now mkay
mkay
oh oh i nuh-i knew it
oo wednesday uh-wednesdays tough i guess- maybe i could do somthin uh thursday afternoon
oh yeah
yeah tuesday mornings good
yeah i think thats the best day
oh mrs cartman ive been uh very bad mkay
oh yeah that makes me hot mkay
uh you see chef ms choksondik has very large uh honkers and she doesnt seem to like wearing a bra
no its really not as nice as you might imagine chef mkay
we dont like to talk about it
after being dismissed from teaching he went off to write romance novels his first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay pulitzer prize and was considered the best homoerotic novel since huckleberry finn
well we really havent ll-looked
what
oh thats great mr garrison youve finally come to terms with yourself
yeah congratulations
every year the fourth graders do "the miracle worker" and every year i have to sit and watch it
eric your friends and your family are all concerned about your weight mkay
now eric all these people came here and paid to send you to camp because they care about you
uh whats all this about mrs cartman is eric having trouble at his weight-management camp
eric thats fantastic mkay
christmas is about presents if we all buy presents everyone benefits mkay
oh i dont really give a shit ive done enough shit outside today and shit
sh were watching "behind the blow" mkay
okay boys this is the first day of sexual education mkay now i know that some of you think this is very funny words like "penis" and "vagina" nuh- now stop that mkay were goin tuh get through this by being mature and grown up mkay now this is the male anatomy mkay here we see the testes and the scrotum stop that mkay the next person that laughs is gonna get a referral mkay now in order to have intercourse the man takes his penis and he hmmm uhh lets see the man takes his penis and he hm
well sure i have its just i was about 19 at the time so its been about 21 years mkay lets see uh im pretty sure i took th-yeah i took the penis and i bu- uh what the hell did i do with that damned thing
uh thanks so much for letting me come over ms choksondik
yeah ive already gone over most of the basics you know uh with the boys but i uh eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls in case i "missed" anything
right oral sex which of course would be
penis or vagina right oral sex mkay
yeah why d-uh did you
well uh how long did you wait before you had uh doobers
oh im im sorry
ah actually i understand perfectly i i wasnt exactly the captain of the football team either huh huh hehehuh anyhow and then as i got older my my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same thats how i got my nickname in college
"that guy with the really big head"
anyway i i sort of lost any confidence and found it impossible to ever ask a woman out mm hm mm
neither have i
uh not me huhuh okay
right
alright boys i now have all the information i need to teach you the female anatomy hmkay mkay this part here is the vaginal opening this is where the man puts his- eric what the hell are you doing
why are you wearing a condom
eric you cant get aids from just sitting around you have to get it from sex
yes
yes now will you all pay attention please the vagina and the clitoris are on the outside and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye
now here we can see the interior female anatomy things like the uterus and the ovaries are on the inside
and here we see the tender magical uterus here we see the enticing voluptuous fallopian tubes mkay
mkay so apparently the lesson plan tomorrow is sposed to involve the secretion of bodily fluids mkay
why sure hey uh i think i can get through that stuff pretty quick mm uh maybe we should come up with another lesson plan
uh right right uh like in the nipples
it says here that the uh head of the penis is actually the most sensitive part mkay
and these are the two areas most important to-
i dont know it doesnt feel wrong ive been thinking about you a lot ms choksondik

so long
hes right
well from now on im only going to associate with other hybrid-car drivers everyone else is just ignorant mkay
its like you had a guardian angel mkay
but hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug mkay
its simply asking too much
wu-weve got the tv working
attention students proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement
retaliation oh my god mkay
yeah me too
mkay students we have a very special guest speaker today who can tell me the name of our countrys last vice-president
no the last one
no clintons vice-president he is here today to talk to you students about some very serious issues please welcome al gore
uhhh ohhhkay thank you mr gore
mrs cartman we have had it with your son's behavior mkay little billy turner is now being treated at the hospital
you know that's not the point
we have tried at this school to make eric understand that there are boundaries mkay but frankly we believe his behavioral problems start at home
mrs cartman i know this is extremely difficult but there is help out there for people like you have you ever heard of a show called ''nanny 911''
all the girls go out in the hall please i need to speak with the boys of this class mkay boys we have a very serious problem ive just come from the mens restroom and somebody went number 2 in the urinal
and some jokester took a poop in it okay now i want whoever did it to come forward right now and it will be less painful for everybody mkay
excuse me could we get back to the issue please you all dont seem to understand how serious this is now who made dookie in the urinal oh you think its funny huh mkay mkay youre gonna think its real funny when the police get here
but there must have been some motive nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason
look what-ever you believe the fact of the matter is somebody dropped a dookie in the school urinal and theres still no explanation for that
more important you arent the one who had to walk into the boys bathroom okay after having tuh to wake up early you know theres no no coffee in the teachers lounge and then you you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal like its laughin at you
no im not saying theyre related
oh no not the goddamned-
now you might all think ive given up finding out who crapped in the urinal mkay and maybe maybe you think its a victimless crime this is mr venezuela the school janitor okay hes the person who has to clean up when some trickster drops a dook in the wrong toilet mr venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best okay hes got three kids at home hes got a car that barely works hes gotta clean up puke with sawdust mkay then he walks into the boys room and sees a big meaty chud starin him in the face so when you crapped in that urinal mkay you might as well have just dropped your pants and laid a turd right on top of mr venezuelas head oh you think its funny huh
huh
why clyde why did you do it
you got a whole school here clyde mkay you got over three hundred people that need to use the boys room then you decide youre gonna be a comedian mkay and pinch one off in the urinal and leave it layin there for everyone to have to look at okay okay you think its funny but nobody else does they gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll
mkay thats good lets see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade come on in please im just trying to get your son to explain why he would drop a dook in the urinal
attention students apparently clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal because clyde had a colostomy at age 5 kay now whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large the boys bathroom is closed until further notice cause one of you thought it would be a good idea to pull down your pants mkay hover your buttcheeks over the urinal and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog mkay oh you think thats funny huh let me assure you there is nothing funny about going up to a nice clean unsuspectin urinal kay droppin your pants then turnin around squattin over that urinal kay maybe maybe pullin your buttcheeks apart with your hands mkay and then layin out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see oh yeah thats real funny im gonna catch this sonofabitch if its the last thing i do mkay
when you dook in the urinal its bad mkay how would you feel if somebody came into your home mkay pulled down their pants and laid a big mud monkey right on your moms face oh you think thats funny huh yeah thats real funny
you need to watch for bad behavior and make sure anyone in the halls during class has a hall pass mkay
now eric being the school hallway monitor is a big responsibility mkay it is important that you take the job seriously and that you dont abuse the power
m mkay ya-you realize evolution has been pretty much uhhh proven
eric be quiet
uh it might be best if you just let it go mkay
yeah yeah we we get it mr nelson
uh eric cartman we got an emergency message from your mother "do not show picture kyle didnt have it after all found it under your desk" she said youd know what that means mkay
nice one randy
uhits okay eric we understand your illness mkay
well all right eric well good luck on dateline tonight
eric come on in your friends want to say "hi" mkay
eric that is not appropriate behavior mkay you cannot purposely infect other kids with your disease
kyle the thing about tattlin is eh tattlins bad mkay because nobody likes a tattle-tale mkay
mkay kids we have something very serious we need to discuss today hmkay it appears that some kids in school are getting high by choking themselves some kids call it "the choking game" hmkay but but choking yourself is bad hmkay don- dont do that hmkay
schoolchildren are often experimenting with dangerous ways to get high hmkay like sniffin glue guzzlin cough medicine huffin paint hmkay but theyre all bad mkay
well its a its not actually cat urine but male cats when theyre marking their territory uh spread concentrated urine to fend off other male cats and a-and that could get you really high mkay re-really reeeally high okay probably shou-shouldnt have told you that just now hmkay tha that was probably bad
students quiet please mkay as you may or may not know today is canada appreciation day
mkay so weve been asked to show you a video from the world canadian bureau uh start the tape please
welcome to detention mkay you are here until your parents come and pick you up use your time to study
eric get your buns back over here mkay
wendy
eh somebod - somebody call the principal
with an inexperienced man as president we do know it he is right game over man okay
uh whats going on here mr gueermo
third team foul on westchester bobcats mkay ball goes back over to the cows

mkay so now the computer will show a command bar mkay and we type in "x = y + 1" mkay and then it says we hit command-y to bring up the menu screen
mkay now right-click on menu item "equate o" and type in "input y"

mkay parents some of you have already heard but most of you have not mkay weve had a terrible incident occur at the school apparently a young girl uh went up to a young boy here at the school mkay and queefed in his face
they have power and they have courage
fishsticks yeah i l- i like fishsticks mkay
now just what the heck is going on here this is not what we have taught you in this school kyle and stan youve always been tolerant of gay people
you just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town
we will always remember the way that gordon bravely read the announcements every morning led us in the pledge of allegiance mkay and touched many kids lives here at the school and even though we now know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name i know this has been pretty traumatizing mkay but now we must decide who will pick up where little gordon left off who will take his place reading the morning announcements its a big responsibility because it will be your voice the entire school listens to mkay and although gordon stoltski can never be replaced mkay there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to have his or her voice heard every morning
oh this is it huh okay uhhh mike why dont we have you try out first ituh mkay

okay there we go thats cut the speakers off now what was it you were trying to do kyle

yes
yeah a student is trying to make an appointment to see the principal mkay
oh i see
uh i i needed the silver package okay okay can we do that
well yeah but see the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet
i know that intellilink has had some hiccups uhkay but ive hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the intellilink system and make sure it runs smoothly i want you all to meet pat conners
dont "hello" us pat this system that youre responsible for now isnt working out so what the hell are you gonna do about it
getting acclimated do you know how much money we wated on that thing how about you take some damned responsibility get the hell out of here pat youre fired get out well how the hell are we gonna clean up pats mess i guess i dunno i guess we got no choice mkay were just gonna need to the upgrade to the intellilink gold package
no see its a $10000 upgrade but it should clean up all of pats mistakes
well ih its good to be a little defensive around you miles mkay lets lets not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike" "nkay"
no now you listen to me intellilink is a great idea and we just need the goddamned gold package we are doublin down
no they have to be able to get grades

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
uh take a seat wendy i guess some mean things were said and i need to get to the bottom of it
uh no wendy apparently you called butters girlfriend a hobbit
uh but but wendy kim kardashian is considered to be extremely beautiful mkay
now wendy kim might be uh full-figured but a womans outward appearance isnt all that matters mkay have you stopped to consider that maybe just maybe youre jel
uh that may be true but there is a very fine line wendy between being a feminist and being a hater mkay and youre gonna have to find that line because nobody likes a girl whos jelly
now wendy ive tried to be patient with you cause youve always been a good student mkay but calling a little girl fat and ugly is never mkay
no no excuses you have a problem bein jelly wendy okay just maybe i should have you sent off to jelly school
thats right in fact im gonna call the jelly school right now okay im sorry about this but its gone too far ive had it hello is this the jelly school okay i have a girl here whos extremely jelly uh see if you can take her in for a few weeks okay youre full okay yeah i guess she dodged a bullet this time but shed better watch her jelly behavior

sorry im late i had to stop and get my own breakfast because i figured yall would be having doughnuts but im actually gluten-free so i cant have doughnuts mkay
im just sayin that i personally feel sooo fuckin amazing
thats probably gluten mkay
gluten causes sluggishness irritability and nearly all behavioral problems
see thats probably the gluten talkin uhkay if you cut out gluten you dont ever get pissed off
then eat it
if its not dangerous then eat that pure concentrated gluten okay
oh you see that his dicks flyin off

youre right mamaive been bad
no im bad—
let me—let me through let me through
i know its amazing this is all a dream come true you knowthe past few days ive been re-living the past but during this tournament i started to change and i just wanna say to the russians—that if i can change then yous can change i know how it is when youre gettin old you know and youre gettin aggressive because your dick doesnt work the way it used to
but just because our dicks dont work doesnt mean we should go back to the way things were in the immortal words of sting—we all share the same biology regardless of ideology
