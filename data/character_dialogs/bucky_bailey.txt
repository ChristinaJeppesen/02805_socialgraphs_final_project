mr mackey what is happening here at your school is no different from what is happening all over the country bullying has become an epidemic im afraid and we at bully buckers ™ are trying to stamp it out what is your schools policy on bullying
aha well one of your students told us he thinks bullying at your school is getting worse
he didnt want that disclosed
we would like to have an anti-bullying assembly with your students this afternoon
you believe positive thinking is really whats critical in schools right now whats wrong with you
no shut up what kind of counselor says no to an anti-bullying campaign bullying needs to be stopped now this afternoon
wuhhh duhhh you may only have an internet degree but why dont you start acting like youre a school counselor and not an uninformed backwards little dork mkay
what makes a bully the truth is there are more bullies at your school than you even think and the student who lets bullying happen is just as bad as the bully himself come on out lorraine i asked your school mate lorraine here to help me out are you bullied in the school lorraine
kids pick on you call you names
what kind of things do they say to you
do they say "nice pants why do you wear them up to your tits"
bullying affects everyone and only if the entire school is united against it can bullying ever be stopped go go get out of here now what we at bucky baileys bully busters ™ like to do is get the schools to make an anti-bullying video so who would like to be the young student director in charge of our video we just need one student to be the leader of our anti-bullying campaign what are you all chicken nobody wants to be in charge of the anti-bullying video
