in the past few days weve all heard of the healthy benefits of interorectogestion and so making food that can easily be inserted into the ass is essential now everyone knows that some foods are simple to shove up the ass - puddings soups raisins this is a nice raisin pudding right here - but we can also still eat our favorite foods what were gonna do today is prepare a thanksgiving turkey for interorecto now the key to shoving a turkey up your ass is first wrapping it in string keeping the pointy wings neatly at the side
not right now i just wanna focus on my turkey right now now were going to baste the turkey with lubricating gel rather than with juice - thisll help smooth the insertion later on we still bake at four hundred degrees for twenty minutes a pound when its done well get something like this so now were ready to go looks delicious lets try it out aaaaa- yeah get it up there yeah aaaa yeeaahhhh phew and that is how you eat a turkey well be right back with more
i always love when spring is on the way such a fun and inspiring time to decorate just like most women out there ive really gotten into queefing lately its a lot of fun and interesting ways we can decorate our queefs and just make them more dynamic for the holidays what were gonna do is just cut out some paper like this and cut out little stars and little moon shapes and were gonna just jam those up and they have custom simple little sparkles from the hobby stores they come in little tube which make them very easy to just shoot right up the ol there we are and of course you can feel free to add little flowers or maybe some festive easter grass but the point is that when were done we can let one rip see how pretty that was its a good thing
