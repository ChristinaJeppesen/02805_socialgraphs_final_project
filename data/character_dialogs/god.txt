yea look upon me and know me
hello satan its been a long time
what brings you here do you wish to mount your unholy war against heaven
you want to rule more than hell you want to destroy the earth
jesus what the hell happened to you
you got kicked out of here for being a headstrong rebel and now youre a whiny little bitch
no youve become dependent on relationships so you havent even considered the option of not being with either of them and if youre not sexually attracted to someone youre not ever going to be but saddam isnt right either hes the other extreme you need to spend time alone so that you can find the balance the middle ground thats what i always do because im a buddhist
bingo
it was nice to see you again satan
goodbye
saddam ive been hearing rumors that youre secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here
it looks like a chemical weapons plant
alright just checking
kyle broflovski
why do you endure all the farts kyle
what you are doing is the most awesome thing ever
who else would take such torment
you should like shave your head and get all peaceful about it your sacrifice saves the world
