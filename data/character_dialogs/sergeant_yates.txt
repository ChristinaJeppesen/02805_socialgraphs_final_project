dammit marsh why couldnt you have just kept your stupid ugly kid in line
yeah showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored so nobody has seen what muhammad looks like
muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all
alright well put a sheet over him
obviously the terrorists are for real what does that paper say we have placed bombs all over your city you will give muhammad to us the celebrities want muhammad for his power not to be ridiculed we want that power huzzah
you wont believe it
mayor we do not have the resources to deal with this situation a full evacuation is impossible
idiot if he isnt seen were about to definitely get bombed
sir does this mailman belong to you
theres been an asian turf war sir and your son appears to have caused it
well send a bill for the damages but in the meantime please keep a closer eye on your child sir
well at least everything is accounted for thank god you came when you did dr janus
well i suppose theres no need for jail mr and mrs stotch so long as you ground your son
this is south park police
we know the truth dr janus
hes not chinese hes white
your name is dr janus
thats right of all his multiple personalities the strongest was lu kim and we never would have known if it hadnta been for inspector butters
yes im sure he could but then again does the world really need another therapist
well i mean would it really be so bad for us to just let him go on thinking hes lu kim forever now that city sushi is gone city wok is the only chinese restaurant left in town
