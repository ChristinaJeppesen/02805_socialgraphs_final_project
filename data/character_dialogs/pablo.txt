this is now secondary rainforest we are entering notice the canopy of foliage
the rainforest is very delicate and we must take steps to protect it
here look these are squirrel monkeys endangered inhabitants of the rainforest
and here is a three-toed sloth
oh yes uh this is what we call a coral snake notice the red markings quite an amazing creature
whats the matter little boy
naw naw you must remember this snake is more afraid of us than we are of it oh agh
