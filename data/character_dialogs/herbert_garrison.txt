yes kenny what is it
i thought you just came from the bathroom
okay okay go ahead
as i was saying you all seem to enjoy this show even though it isnt based in reality theres much more to life than two young men farting on each other and throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad and usually they get taken right off the air you see you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment
pay attention children
im going to join your parents in requesting that you dont watch terrance & phillip any more ever
thats right children are there any questions
yes stanley
what what do you mean

yeah it feels really good
you know i i feel like i can start anew if its alright with you id like to go back to teaching the third grade
okay children lets take our seats my name is mr garrison and im the new kindergarten teacher i used to be the third grade teacher but i had a little "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where i lived off of "rat carcasses" but im all better now and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching as long as it was for kindergarten but its not a demotion no i mean just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten thats not a demotion is it no thats right its not well lets start with roll call uh lets see filmore anderson
sally bands
ike broflovski
broflovski i had your older brother kyle in my third-grade class hes a very smart kid im sure you are too well thats bad news for everybody else because i will be grading you all on a curve
and thats how the relationship with my father sort of ended theres still some sort of skeletons in the closet but things between us are a little better okay children well now its time for us to elect a class president so first we must pick nominees who would like to nominate someone
okay filmore youll be our first nominee and who else yes jenny
in a minute jenny who else wants to nominate a class president oh come on you cant have an election with just one person running whats the fun in that ike how about you youre a genius
okay our second nominee is ike the genius okay children now well hear briefly from each nominee filmore why dont you go first
very enthralling okay ike how about you
well this is gonna be a tough one kids
so thats six votes for filmore and six votes for ike and the last vote is for uh lets see flora i cant tell who you voted for youve got the winning vote flora who dyou pick
flora you have to pick one filmore or ike
oh great floras undecided well youre just gonna have to sit there flora and think about it until you come up with an answer
oh for christs sakes youre all acting like a bunch o kids
oh thank god flora alright who do you vote for
okay so then the total is six for filmore and now seven votes for ike ike is the new class president
what
oh of all the juvenile things ive ever heard you lost filmore dont be such a baby alright alright ill count up the ballots again okay we had one vote for filmore and this time i again get six votes for filmore and seven votes for ike

oh will you grow up
jesus alright well wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote now go home

oh jesus tap-dancing christ
theres a box next to filmores name and a box next to ikes whats not to understand

run for your lives children ill try to fight it off
oh oh um pleasure to meet you miss donnell youre looking well
look its very simple we took a vote and the vote tied so now we gotta come up with a way--
oh stop it stop it stop i-i-it look kids were all in this kindergarten class together we have to respect one another or else were in for a terrible school year
half the kids in the class didnt vote for your nephew so what about them you dont give a crap about them because theyre not on your side people like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time but when it comes to middle america you think were all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment well just because youre on tv doesnt mean you know crap about the government now get your ass back on first class and respect this classs right to make up their own minds oh sorry i got a little off the subject there kids
oh no children i think ive just made this a whole lot worse
okay children the lawyers for ikes side have agreed with the lawyers on filmores side to hold another meeting regarding form 22f do we all have that form
jesse jackson
we dont have any african-americans in our class
alright so apparently what were gonna do now is hand-count each persons ballot--
you yuh you what

hello parents and welcome to the 13th annual south park thanksgiving pageant

alright see you next year parents
its called intervention eric
yeah except for me i just wanted to see the look on your face when they told you
but thats not the question
hey everybody its on in thirty minutes
oh i bet this is it here it comes
and so children instead of saying "hand in your papers" i may now say "hand in your shit" any questions
no no filmore you can say "i have to poop and shit" or "oh shit i have to poop" but not "i have to shit" are we all clear
look its all about context well for example recently i have come out and admitted that i was a homosexual im gay that means that now i can say the word "fag" on television they usually dont allow "fag" but because im gay its alright and with the new approval of the word "shit" that means that finally i am free to sayhey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you do oh this is great
hey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there-
hey watch it fag
i called you a fag because im gay and that means im free to use the word "fag" so piss off you fag-shitter heh so hey there shity shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag ba doop a doop doo
well they cant use "fag" because you cant say "fag" unless youre a homosexual
no see you got beeped
thats right
well well well guess we learned something new about you jimbo you frickin fag you wanna make out or something
oh boy this show is really reaching for plot now

hey youre the guy on the screen
eric that is a lot of money dont you think you should keep it in the bank instead of at your house
okay children who can tell me what a condom is yes jenny
thats a con-dor jenny con-dor con-doms are what we use to stop the spread of stds yes filmore
no we cant do fingerpaint you kids wanna get herpes huh how about a nice bucket of aids sound good now pay attention alright im going to show you the proper way to put on a condom first of all you remove the condom from its package then you find which way the condom rolls out put it in your mouth and apply and its as simple as that any questions
okay children now i wanna review the different sexual positions who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about
missionary position good a little boring but tried and true what else
thats right doggie style we went over mhm
uh huh pile driver position good quaid
yes good flora you remembered the filthy sanchez
yesyou can give your partner the ol hot karl sure
jesus christ
wha why did you pan to me just now what the hell is that sposed to mean
okay children so what other sexual positions have we talked about yeah the wrap-around butt grab sure cant forget that uh huh reverse cowgirl good kevin hot lunch sure she likes that donkey punch uh huh glass-bottom boat good one yes fish-eye good jenny chili dog mm-hm

i cant go tomorrow the jizzfest is tonight
this is unbelievable you know i seem to remember when the airlines said "we need a 15 billion dollar bailout from the taxpayers-"
well we gave them the 15 billion dollar bailout and they fired their employees anyway so now we have three people to clear 400 passengers
so where did that money go ill tell you where it went it went into the pockets of the presidents and ceos of the airlines so they can keep their multimillion-dollar salaries
you think you can treat us however you want because we have to fly well ill tell you what sally sassalot im gonna come up with a new mode of transportation a ahah brand new vehicle thatll put all you bastards out of business
you think i cant do it i got a masters degree in mechanical engineering at denver community college you watch me come on everybody
now its got to be simple like a moped but with the ability to travel at much faster speeds the designs of our electrical moped were altered with a- no nonono this wont work either
it has to be more stable mr hat a moped would be too dangerous at those speeds damnit now what if the jet power of an aircraft could be scaled down into a personal vehicle
oh mr hat would you stop drooling over enrique iglesias and wait a minute what did you say
thats it gyration a gyroscope it would allow for maximum balance and yet mr hat youre a genius its so simple and yet genius
weve done it mr hat airline companies be damned weve invented a whole new mode of transportation get some investors on the phone well what are you waiting for
gentlemen imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports
it is incredible mr hat and what makes it possible is its patented gyroscope design gentlemen i give you it
it gets over 300 miles to the gallon and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour
now it is easily operated using four flexigrip handles two of them are on each side left side for throttle right side for steering the third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus to keep the driver in place
there we go now the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth as such put the four together and were ready to go
okay now youre just gonna feel a little pinch
its alright its just locking you in you can take it doing great kathy hows that ride okay now use your mouth to operate the turn signals and youre off great who else wants to give it a spin
were in the money mr hat were in the money mr hat oh hi jimbo can i help you

oh god-damnit youd better be kidding
the airline companies are losing money because of their own incompetence and their own inefficiency

thank you mr mackey
okay children now for those of you who are new my name is mr garrison
well i was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for mr hat

so thats mr slave the teachers assistant or as i like to write for short the teachers ass
okay mr slave go sit until i need you
im not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy in fact its going to be long and hard really long and really hard
eheh the first thing were gonna be learning about is communist russia
now stalin was a big silly when it came to
eric did you just throw a paper airplane
very funny eric kennys dead
that does it i will not put up with foolishness in my class its time for punishment take it mr slave
i will not put up with tom foolery in my class room children mr slave put this rubber ball in your mouth take that slavey take it thisll get me fired for sure
okay children lets take our seats uh apparently none of you tried to get me fired yesterday so i guess were just gonna have to go on and learn more today now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the bunsen burner
good butters now if we take the glass tube of the bunsen burner we can also see how other things react evaporation is an exothermic reaction so lets look at an endothermic one mr slave position 7 please now im gonna put the glass tube under mr slaves tight ass the heat from mr slaves ass will act as our new conductor of energy
okay now butters could you bring over lemmiwinks for me please
newton was the first to discover that for every action theres a reaction - thank you butters now what do you think is gonna happen when i introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of mr slaves ass well lets see
that was a brilliant idea having me put a gerbil up your ass mr slave now well get fired for sure
thats it theyre gonna fire me for being gay twenty-five million here we cooome
you wanted to see me principal victoria
oh dear sounds like im gettin fired
oh no youre firing me oh well i cant stop being who i am i cant help the way god made me guess i just have to go

yeah
god-damnit

i mean i stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a goddamn medal

ding-ding ding-ding

uh i uh im very happy to get this award uh but you know what makes me even happier sucking balls
it isnt working sing your song mr slave
uh
god-damnit dont you people get it im trying to get fired here
look this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher
tolerant but not stupid look just because you have to tolerate something doesnt mean you have to approve of it if you had to like it itd be called the museum of acceptance "tolerate" means youre just putting up with it you tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or or you tolerate a bad cold it can still piss you off jesus tapdancing christ

just let me say what i came here to say i know we had a falling out and things were said that shouldnt have been said i want to apologize for calling you a faggot
well wait wait it gets better ive forgiven you for walking out on me after i had my sex change and uh and im ready to take you back mr slave

mr slave i am legally a woman now if you wanna get married you have to marry me
oh thats just great theyre gonna let queers and homos get married huh
well just see about this you fudge-packin fags ill stop that gay-marriage law
jealous of what im doin this out of principle to protect the sanctity of marriage fags are gettin married over my dead body
these homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions well i say marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman
they passed this law behind our back we need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay that homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions and there is only one way for us all together to make that message very clear we need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin hell out of them come on everybody lets get some queers and some trucks and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag
appeal to the governor ohcome on wheres your balls fag drag
eh fah fag drag
governor we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill
because youre the governor
well think of the children if you allow gays to get married then youre also givin them full rights as parents to adopt you think kids can be raised by queers
but if you had such a study a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child
mr governor i will get you that study
okay students change of plan youve all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs but now were going to mix it up a little wendy and kyle will no longer be together
lets see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg shall we kyle you are now with stan and wendy is with bebe
come on bebe well take your egg for you and wendy to look after
and well just take this egg for stan and kyle to look out for
wendy were doing an experiment here you go boys
hoh now what makes you say that wendy im sure two boys can handle an egg just fine and if not well certainly prove a point to that goddamned governor wont we
never mind just carry on children just carry on as two reckless little boys will
okay children its wednesday time for an official egg check heidi and eric
okay annie and timmy
good millie and clyde i saw yours before class powder and kenny
now how about our gay couples stan and kyle
what
thats impossible are you sure you didnt break it and switch eggs on me wheres my signature
two boys cant possibly take care of an egg
it isnt fine it has two daddies you call that fine it may be fine on the outside but inside its confused and embarrassed look at the freak egg it has two daddies two daddies two daddies come on class lets rip on the freak egg two daddies two daddies
damnit damnit stan and kyles egg is still doin fine those little assholes are screwin up my entire plan yes what what the hell is this

i cant do that eric
you have to get an a eric here ill sign this new egg for you well pretend this never happened all right just put on the old hair color in the same eyes there we go good as new go enjoy the rest of your recess
okay well youre welcome eric now just run along
because im a nice teacher all right
nothing its all okay just take your damn egg
eric youve never been anything but a problem for me youre taking that egg and if you break it again ill break both your legs and burn down your house do you hear me
get out of my face urrgh this scientific study isnt turning out the way i planned looks like im gonna have to intervene
are you jakartha
mrs garrison i spoke to your associates on the telephone
i have a little problem i need taken care of i heard youre the best
its an egg
i can pay two thousand now three more when the job is finished
i dont care scramble it fry it do what you will it has to look like an accident
whats the matter you afraid you cant do it cant say that i blame ya that egg has caused me nothin but problems since day one i guess youre not as good as they say you are
then why are you scared of one little egg
thats more like it
thank you governor
ladies and gentlemen with the help of some adorable fourth-grade students weve completed our scientific non-biased study of fags having kids come on up children the parents were grouped together as male and female as you can see
yes what is it im a little busy
what y-your youre too late
no you can- hello hello you told me you killed that freak egg
well its here youd better make damn sure it doesnt reach these steps uncracked haha anyhow as i was saying we put one egg into the hands of two male students
the the egg that the two boys were given just-
in conclusion governor you can rest assured that-

so today youre all going to the gymnasium to have your scalps examined
im sure this class is clean but were gonna be examined so that if anyone has the lice we can stop it before it spreads lice can live in anybodys hair
okay kids today were going to review some civil war history who can tell me what year the war started
with what
y-yes some lice was discovered and the proper action has been taken
uh yes
that doesnt matter its over
its being kept confidential theres a policy in the schools not to single out a kid who has lice because of the embarrassment it can cause okay

yello

you boys make me sick youre well on your way to being men who only think with their penises i am assigning all of you weekend homework you are going to read hemmingways book "the old man and the sea"

now kids this book is very controversial and has just been taken off the banned books list
its called the catcher in the rye and it has some very risqué parts
and strong vulgar language
and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because its thought to be so inappropriate
tonight i want you to read chapters one through five and tomorrow well discuss the-
uh-yes apparently john lennons killer said he was inspired by the catcher in the rye but he was just a kook
you will read it at home and you will all be mature about its adult themes and language

my fellow americans we live in an un-presented time of uncertainty i want to speak to you human-to-human because with gods grace this will be the last time you ever hear from me when i started this campaign i was saying a lot of shit because i was angry and then i turned that anger into pushing buttons by more and more outrageous slowly people started paying attention to me and i guess it made me feel powerful well now the chickens have come home to roost sooner or later we all get exposed were all held accountable for what we say what we do there is only one thing that matters now on november eighth you must vote against me and show the world that you didnt think the new star wars was all that good when youre in that voting booth remember that every vote for hillary clinton is a vote that shows the world we agree that the force awakens was more like a happy day reunions special than a movie the choice is yours america please make the right one

its air israel with enough vaccines for every adult in town
oh jeez thanks everybody
nice doing business with you you little child-murdering pedophiles
okay children lets take our seats good morning kids so great to see you i know its always a little hard coming back from a break you know you know weve had a few distractions but lets just pick up where we left off kids over this last break i met somebody and uh im pretty excited and uh weve been really enjoying each others company and you know things got physical his name is rick and uh well anyway i really wanted you to meet him just-- you know hes a – hes a little nervous so just be cool okay come on rick oh come on you big silly theyre not gonna bite you class this is rick now look were not gettin married tomorrow or anything were just enjoying each others company and seeing where this whole thing takes us
hes very shy but i wanted you kids to know that he treats me really well way better than that narcissistic psychopath marcus
okay okay well youre gonna come pick me up after school
ill be ready like 330 they like you they do no thats just them being them okay text me at lunch bye ri-i-i-i-ick oh shit its marcus should i answer it i have to answer it hes gonna suspect something just keep quiet about rick dont say anything h-hey marcus whats up no im in the classroom with the kids arent– arent i kids o-okay you couldnt really hear them but im with the kids no whos rick weve never heard of rick have we kids will you fucking say something marcus marcus i really dont– why fine go ahead thats fi-fine okay geez well nice going kids what is wrong with you you dont listen and you blatantly go against my directions
i ask them for a response and nothing first they just sit there when i need their focus and their energy and when i ask them–
i dont know how much more i can take of this
ive got enough problems as it is
good morning class good mornin good morning good mornin good mornin to you and you and and you and you so how are you guys youre probably wondering how things are with rick i just flat out told him that marcus was still calling me and you know what rick said he said "if youre not over marcus then take some time ill be here" is that not the sweetest thing youve ever heard i called him back like three minutes later and i said "i dont need time i need you" i said "can i just come over" and the way he held me when i got to his house it was like "ohhh this is security" and then later on when we were in bed id had my head on his chest and i was just playing with his chest hairs a little bit and i said– excuse me butters are you paying attention could somebody wake butters up please
im sorry butters am i boring you
okay well then maybe you can tell me what rick said when i told him about marcus
anybody does anyone know what i said when rick held me tight
"this is security" none of you are paying attention none of you know the answers do you
okay children lets take our seats i know theres a lot of things going on and were all a little bit worried ive heard some of you express concern over current events so i think we should discuss whats happening it is true – rick and i did get into a fight over the weekend now i dont know what youve heard and what you havent but rick was wrong okay hes the one that needs to apologize
putin it was just a little noise when i pulled out nobody was "pootin" okay and anyway you kids shouldnt be talking about that kind of stuff geez
