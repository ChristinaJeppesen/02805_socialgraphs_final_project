yeah no im telling you tracy its the greatest thing ever im getting all my twitter and instagram comments on paper and the nasty mean stuff all gets edited out
yeah and the coolest thing ever since i started using this service all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me so cool right
am so but i dont care people just have to accept my body the way it is
if you do not like me you are not allowed in my safe spaaaace
oh no not reality somebody stop him
look around you what do you see people who are slim skinny but not everyone can have nice bodies like them just imagine it putting your pictures up on twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight it happens all too often
and so together we have created #shamelessamerica so no one is ever labeled
oh my god what have we done
