howdy folks

you know tom i think something like this was bound to happen theres those at the top who control the means of production and then theres the working class that enables those means by selling their labor power for wages when theres conflict the ruling class tries to blame the working class
no my organs have been compacted so if the box opens i spill out and die i believe the working class needs to revolt against capitalism and bring about socioeconomic emancipation
at what cost sir do you care that personal worth is being reduced by capitalists to exchange value
free trade is not free-dom perhaps socialism is the answer
the history of this world
is the history of class struggles
alienated from the products of their labor
from their fellow laborers and from their very essence
the oppressed worker will eventually strike back at those capitalists who control the means of production
we have nothing to lose but our chains
we will unite in revolution
nothing else can be allowed into the fulfillment center no matter what the cost
then follow me to hell
theyre going well tom thank you you know what happened to me could happen to any worker at a fulfillment center im speaking to congress here and then heading back to colorado tomorrow via ups
how is the common worker kept submissive by the institutions and the ideology of the bourgeoisie we only ask for compassion for a fair share of the fruits of our labors
yeah youre jeff bezos
this isnt about revenge bezos its about the production of too many useful things resulting in too many useless people
damn you you made everything nice and convenient didnt you bezos but humans are more than consumers
what are you gonna do to me
