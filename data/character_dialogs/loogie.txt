my associates here tell me you were working cherry creek tonight is that true
kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years i do it just like my big brother before me and my oldest brother before that
let me ask you something you were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kids pillow then what
how are the kids parents gonna know there was a tooth under their childs pillow
look any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress the tooth racket is much more involved we keep careful track of what houses weve hit so that we dont hit the same one twice in less than two months inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow but leave a note for mom and dad to see this is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow once the note is in place in the last house we start all over going back to the first house but this time all we have to do is collect money and the kids never know what hit em
the hardest part is getting teeth we tried various places cemeteries hockey games anywhere we can find them
the teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size color and quality but theres never enough teeth never enough
and now my only problem is what do i do with you
tell you what how would you like to run the south park tooth racket for me
its that or else i can cut off your penises
ill cut you in at 2%
theyre what theyre not gonna pay me who the hell do they think they are i want those south park kids dead i want their families dead i want their houses burned to the ground oh hi there mister my mommy and daddy are out front if you need em
sit down mr foley do you want some spaghetti
i told the ada a thousand times i know nothing about teeth im just an 8-year-old boy who likes climbing trees and playing in puddles
well then throw him in
well well well what do we have here
did you bastards really think you could hide from me forever kolovski put this buttwipe out of his misery
aw drat
it was a trap
jesus the little sick kid was a setup all along how could i be so stupid
i cant believe i fell for such an obvious trap what the hell is wrong with me
oh well maybe its good my empire has fallen
yeah i kinda wanted to play in the flag football team this year anyways
naah in a way im just glad the whole things over with
