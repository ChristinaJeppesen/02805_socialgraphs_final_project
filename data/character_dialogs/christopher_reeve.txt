thank you thank you wow what a great audience i just flew into south park used to be i didnt need an airplane
as most of you know i am a strong supporter of stem-cell research
though it is controversial stem cell research is critical in the quest for helping the disabled
in the coming days i will prove to the world that stem-cell research is a miracle
thanks for having me on again larry
well it just proves that the public needs to be educated about stem-cell research see the stem cells from a fetus like this one can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged they are the most powerful thing on the planet
well its very simple and now you can see my arms have better movement
thank you everyone to most people this is just an ordinary fetus but to people like me its hope
