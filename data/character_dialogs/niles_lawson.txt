tom tragedy stuck last night when mall security officer miles "happy" davis was beaten to death with this candy cane after telling a mother she couldnt line up for black friday until thursday night in honor of the slain mall security officer the mall has officially decided to drop another 10% off black friday deals
tom im standing in your doorway because we have a hot news story to report
we just got a call from bill gates he says he can promise us a bigger war on black friday if we play along
thats right tammy lets not forget that having a bloodbath on black friday is good for the news its good for us the bigger the better
right tom because youre sooo about integrity lets go or maybe i should let everyone in the newsroom know what their two anchors are up to back to you
tammy the excitement over black friday is peaking and none other than bill gates himself has shown up to try to make it even bigger
we understand that youve donated some guns to the kids as well
that was amazing sex i enjoyed it immensely how about you
you know microsoft has given kids who want xboxes on black friday a lot of support seems a shame that the fight will be so one-sided
black friday is about to happen and its not even gonna be a fight thats bad for both of us there must be something you can give to kids who want sonys to make the fight more even
yes i think that will do nicely
tom we have breaking news from the south park mall in an effort to make sure everyone is prepared the mall has decided to push black friday by one week
the genius idea was proposed by george r r martin who also suggested "fuck it lets push thanksgiving to december 3rd" for pushing the date the mall is now reducing black friday prices to 96% off to the first hundred people inside the mall this is going to be a fucking bloodbath tom there will be medical tents ambulances face-painting no doubt a lot of people you know and love are going to die
tom black friday is finally almost here and as you can see behind me holiday shoppers are really getting antsy people have been waiting out here since midnight on thanksgiving theyre cold theyre starving and theres already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals joining me now is rick tellmore whos been out here for six days and your five year old son was eaten is that correct
what is it youre hoping to get when black friday does finally start
now some people might say that eating your child is not very christmasy what would you say to them
no doubt christmas is alive and well at the south park mall back to you tom
thats right tom mall officials have said they are ready and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon this years ribbon cutter is of course george r r martin who um doesnt appear to have shown up yet but uhh says he is on his way just like the dragons and zombies in his novels he is on his way
here we go tom george r r martin has finally arrived to cut the red ribbon
tom the shopping frenzy is over and it looks like microsofts new xbox one is this years hot item no doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console black friday is over theres been death violence horrible human behavior and the big winner here decidedly is channel 9 news
