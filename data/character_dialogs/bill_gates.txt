this will change everything
but the way it works do you think people will go through that to travel
hey steve howre you doin
i heard theres a little trouble in uh colorado somewhere
oh my gosh you know when i uh stepped down and left you in charge of the company steve uh i knew there might be some challenges for you
uh huh
youre right steve some changes do need to be made do you know what weakness is steve weakness is believing that competition is healthy see there was a time when xboxes and playstations could both survive in this world but that times done its all headed to one device that people game on watch tv on socialize on theres only going to be one winner i cant have you idiots throwing away everything i worked so hard to achieve clean that shit up
thats right we just wanna do whatever we can to help our supporters get their xboxes at incredible deals on friday so weve come to offer swords and battle axes whatever the kids can carry to help them fight their way through the other shoppers
yes but we are limiting it to one per xbox follower because of course the key thing here on everyones mind is safety
certainly uh eric right
oh i certainly dont wanna step on your toes dont worry im quite good at letting my ceos do what they want
lets face it this is really just about you and me getting xboxes the rest are simply there to help us get through those doors
its not over looks like i came just in time
then lets finish it you and me
winner take all
this is over now you die {cracks the presidents head open and creates a pool of blood then throwing him into a wall for good measure the presidents brain is exposed tired and breathless gates walks over to a table and leans on it a little] its over xbox wins
go on kids go get your xboxes
