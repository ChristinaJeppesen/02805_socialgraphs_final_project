were going to have to rethink cities
oh my god
hello everyone im here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices lets hear it for our volunteers these three people have agreed to be brought here handcuffed to these beds and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device
they have actually agreed to be surgically altered their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus
you agreed to this mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy - and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device making a product that is part human and part centipede and part web browser and part emailing device i give you the humancentipad
alright good looks good guys great work
really nice guys i remember when the first version of the ipad came out people couldnt believe how easy it was to take their videos music and photos and all their shit and share it with other people who could do the same with all their shit the only thing the ipad couldnt do was walk or read until now
what what whats that whats that youre saying
yeah you want out are you saying you want out
fine you dont want to be part of this then just sign right here nooo you didnt read it this says we dont ever have to let you out and that we can do whatever we want dammit why wont it read
