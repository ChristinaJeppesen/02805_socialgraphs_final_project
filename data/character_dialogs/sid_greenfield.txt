were desperate for stories
a-and this one is so compelling
sure this story has everything people furniture talking-ih its a real american story
we just want to do a recreation of the story for our show then well flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter thats it you win we win america wins
dont worry mayor americas most wanted is not about violence its about family
