looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg they found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in colorado
the operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in inglewood theyre all cop killers so im sending you in undercover
what now you listen to me im givin you one last chance youre good cops but you let your emotions get in the way and your little "shoot first ask questions later" technique has no place in this century now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books you got it the mayor is on my ass and blablablah
god damnit those junior detectives and their heroically reckless ways murphy jenkins hopkins get in there
christ those junior detectives have no regard for the law
who the hell are you
hey im in charge of this investigation
but thats not fair
all right detectives lets get one thing straight i do not agree with your methods youre uncontrolled and youre negligent but by god you get the job done congratulations
im probably going to regret this but well im promoting you to full detectives therell be lots of action and that big paycheck youve always wanted
