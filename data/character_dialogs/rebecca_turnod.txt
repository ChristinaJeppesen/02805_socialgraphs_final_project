i want you to try and forget these wild theories and understand that all thats important when it comes to a man and a woman making love is actually length times girth over angle of the shaft divided by mass over width-
are you seriously saying were going to give in to their demands
who is this
your theory is fine doctor but it doesnt matter the tmi equation is true solid science which cannot be changed theres nothing we can do about it
fellow americans as you all know the tmi scale was implemented long ago to assure that each and every american could accurately measure their junk the established equation is a hundred percent accurate
however due to recently collected data we are making one change the national average for penis length is now officially moved from 6 inches to 15 inches anyone with a tmi of over 15 inches is considered "above average"
