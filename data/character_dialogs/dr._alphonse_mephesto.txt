can i help you
brilliant idea huge elephant-sized pigs
ohh thats an even better idea come on in
im so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering
its thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger disease pollution even war i have created things that will change the world for the better for instance here is a monkey with four asses
and here of course is my four assed ostrich and my four assed mongoose
oh uh i suppose so uh oh yes over here here i have rats splice with ducks and gorillas spliced with mosquitos and here i have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish
and over here swiss cheese spliced with chalk and a beard
oh well im sorry children but pig and elephant dna just wont splice havent you ever heard that song by loverboy
diindoon - pig and elephant dna just wont splicealthough maybe i could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours
you know its amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days
hmm what oh excuse me
oh pardon me i tripped could i have some hair please
beautiful its absolutely beautiful my son i think weve finally done it
how luscious our creature has come to fruition boys
oh my god he only has one ass hes of no use to me ill have to burn the room
oh no this entire experiment is turning out very bad
eeegads hes out of control well have to destroy him
hes too dangerous son
son no
oh son youve made a horrible mistake youve put all the people of south park in jeopardy
oh thank buddha i found you boys you must tell me have you seen anything odd lately
no no i said odd
sir if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy then uhhhhh hmmm oh nevermind im afraid theres been a bit of an incident at the ranch you see ive created a large mutant clone of that little boy there and hes broken free
hes terribly dangerous his brain is identical to yours i need you to help me find him
boys boys im lusciously sorry for everything
no son this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere boys im sorry ive caused you such - inconvenience i tried to play god and i failed
all i ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful but i failed perhaps we shouldnt be toying with gods creations perhaps we should just leave nature alone to its simple one assed schematics
mayor weve got a very big problem
yes and i may have made a horrible mistake i was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for thanksgiving
you know to provide food for the needy
well something went wrong and the turkeys broke free and the worst part is theyre really pissed off
we have to stop them or or they could destroy everything time is short
they act just like normal turkeys except theyre evil
somehow i dont think youre taking me seriously
i knew that you were the only person who would listen to me chef
look here in my microscope tell me what you see
oh whoops
now tell me what you see
precisely but look how rapidly its dividing
means the turkeys are growing at an exponential rate if we dont destroy them all theyll take over the town maybe the world
sure
theyre increasing in number mayor these are the vicious turkeys i warned you about
we need more than that theyll only come back in increased numbers
i tried to tell you but you didnt listen
thats not important right now
my god what have we done
but all those poor turkeys theh- theyre all dead
as horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me perhaps i shouldnt be toying with gods creations perhaps i should-
wait wait i know a way to find out
at my laboratory we can do dna genetic testing ill take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here and we can determine who your father is
yes of course i mean that much testing will cost a pretty penny but
three thousand should cover it
oh never mind
all right from everyones accounts ive narrowed down erics possible father to the people in this room officer barbrady chef jimbo mr garrison ned chief running water gerald broflovski myself my friend kevin or the 1989 denver broncos
the test results are in this envelope
shall i open it
erhum ehrum uh the father of eric cartman is indeed someone in this room the father is-
and now to continue the father is indeed someone in this room
gentlemen the father is
where where am i
ohh im sure it was my brother again he tries to shoot me every month
im glad that you could all come i can finally reveal who the father of eric cartman is but first i want to thank kenny mccormick for sacrificing his life--
alright alright the father of eric cartman is say did anybody see that terrance and phillip special last month wasnt that just the funniest thing--
oh as i said before the father is somebody in this room the father is mrs cartman
yes it took quite a while for me to understand as well you see mrs cartman is a hermaphrodite
meaning that she has both male and female genitals
no no not exactly but she did have a penis
the fact of the matter is hermaphrodites cannot bear children so mrs cartmans dna match with eric can only mean that she is his father and she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance
well thats that thank you all for playing
mayor i think the boys may have stumbled onto something here you see mayor frozen links are often found dinosaur eggs woolly mammoths this specimen could be a missing link in our evolution if i can unfreeze the body and perform an autopsy i could learn much about this creatures people and its time
thank you mayor oh and boys i i cant give you a reward for finding this creature but if youd like ill let you name him
steve it is
come on steve weve got work to do unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work well have to use the most advanced methods available
this is very exciting he could be a neanderthal or an australopithecus from the paleolithic era do you see that kevin these clothes are from eddie bauer i havent seen anybody wear clothes from eddie bauer since 1996 this is incredible think of all we can learn from this body all that it can teach us lets just hope the press doesnt get wind of this right away
ladies and gentlemen we still have a lot of work to do but it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months yes its true although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes
thats it kevin now we can begin the autopsy
ugh whats this
thats impossible do an ekg on him
my god he really is alive the ice must have preserved him
no no weve got to think this through mayor this man has not been conscious for almost three years he wont understand what he sees hell be frightened and confused
perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time
oh my god it looks as if hes about to speak
what youre youre hungry
youre youre hungry
me friend friieend me friend ma-phes-to mah-phehs-to
hawgh if we could understand what hes saying then maybe we could get some answers if only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own a mind like a child
steve you-
steeve steeeve steeeve oh good youre here
yes and i need you to communicate with him see if you can understand what hes saying
whatd he say
very interesting
what
tell him tell him hes home
in the year 1999
hes been frozen for the last 32 months
and we found you-
all right all right all-
all right all right calm down
i think thats enough for today
the same
thats right
oh where are you gents from
well theres not a lot to see but come in hes still not responding much to us the shock is still settling in but weve made great progress now that hes in the habitat
yes kevin and i designed a habitat for steve to live in that is completely like his own world everything is 1996-oriented
yes well kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us steve really is he came up with this drawing
how would we do that
as you can see the ice man is listening to ace of base which was a very popular group during his era and primitive drumming soothed his peoples tempers
ah here we see the ice man trying to gain internet access on the computer the internet was still not very big in his time so the web frightens and confuses him its okay he cant hurt you its one-way glass he cant even see us and now the ice man watches television
wait this could be dangerous
hes fine boys and were learning so much from him
hes gone the ice man has broken out
he must have used this door
we have to find him he wont survive long out in the world
no what did you say uh use him for what
i have no idea
was the ice man here
he cant function out here in our time
is it him
does he always do this
have you seen a man who looks similar to us but with a thicker brow and an apish nose
an ice man a man from the past we must find him now where is he
where is he where is steve
weve got to stop it
he has to be around here somewhere
no come back you cant get out youll never live
what
yeah yeah get in line with the rest of us
