i wish i was doing better please mayor have a seat
we had a deal mayor you told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers
disgruntled dissatisfied unamused would you like to know why amazon is so successful because the customer is all that matters now orders are going unfulfilled all over the state of colorado that makes us look very bad it makes you look very bad perhaps you should no longer be a prime member
then we have an understanding goodbye mayor if everyone stays unfulfilled it will be you who pays the price
see how the worker begins to question his determination without his amazon prime status he fluctuates between being and non-being
now torn between memberships the consumer-worker will reason that the strike is pointless prepare a bus we must make sure that boxers who wish to box have a safe way into the fulfillment center
it is not as i expected only one consumer worker broke through the picket lines your townspeople are more stubborn than i thought
perhaps i should give up how i long to return to bezos and touch butts with my wife amazon fulfillment center
yes yes the workers are striking were fucking working on it
is that so now those fools will pay
uh no sorry um you say you have worker-consumers willing to box
very well stay right where you are you didnt tell me there was a bike parade
everything is relevant when it comes to customers
your townspeople are beginning to learn that cooperation is rewarded by fulfillment now theres only one true enemy who stands in our way tonight hes giving a talk on marxist theory
do you know who i am
and you are josh former amazon employee who suffered a workplace accident you were wrongly packaged into a box and now if anyone tries to open it your insides will burst apart so you seek revenge
see how the box ridicules commercialism in order to try and feel better about itself
thats very eloquent for a box-- a box that is the last thing standing in the way of real economic progress for this town
im not going to do anything to you alexa go ahead sent them in
hello children uncle jeff has a surprise for you who wants a special present for the bike parade
whoever opens the box gets whats inside
heheh
whats the matter afraid you wouldnt win
the bike parade was quite useful to me you see people will do anything to have fulfillment they finally realized the only way to get it would be to all work for the fulfillment center
oh you mean your little socialist friend yes hes starting to rattle his sword now too alexa kill kenny
dont you see im trying to help before there was war between classes customers and workers at odds all ive done is create the new class the consumer-worker the future right now your parents your teachers everyone you know are showing up to work at the fulfillment center and im afraid you are all going to lose the bike parade
are you all high
because im over here
no
damn you tegridy
