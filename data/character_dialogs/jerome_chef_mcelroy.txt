look schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day but sex isnt something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams sex is emotional and spiritual it needs to be taught by family i know it can be hard parents but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids you dont know who theyre learning it from it could be from someone who doesnt know someone who has a bad opinion of it or even a complete pervert
its very simple children the right time to start having sex is 17
seventeen
