well i thinks its a horrible tragedy idnt it i mean people arent gonna see timmy for his musical skills theyre laughin at im and i think you shouldnt laugh at people with disabilities
society has to learn how to be more compassionate this is gonna stop if i have to stop it myself
well i think the sad question is "where are the parents in all this" i mean that kids parents are lettin him be exploited and they dont even seem to care
well i mean why are you lettin em do this to your son dont you see that everyones just laughin at him
excuse me skyler morse
nice to meet you im phil collins
i just wanted to tell you that well i think that youre a great guitar player and song writer
its too bad those other guys are holdin you back
well i mean its obvious all the talent and artistic vision in the band comes from you strange how everyone focuses n timmy idnt it i mean even the name of the band is "timmy"
look i used to be in a band too genesis and all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back but then finally i went solo and thats when i started writing really great songs but look if you happen to be on the sidelines you know bein more of a cheerleader than a player well then i guess you should stay on as timmys shadow
that should just about put an end to all this timmy nonsense
last night i went "o"bubudiolast night i went "bubudio"
last night i went "o" bububudio
