santa barbara police department this is snetzl
yes sergeant what can i do for you
hm no we never had any rich african-americans named jefferson here if we had we would have framed him ourselves
yeah i don't uh hold on a second there was one we framed a couple of times but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial
we uhhh found some kids that had stayed over at his place and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges
yeah it was a lot of work took years but we were finally able to arrest him then we planted some evidence took embarrassing photos of his penis and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls you should have seen him squirm
heh yeah but the point is this guy didn't really look black either we had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a dna sample to be sure
