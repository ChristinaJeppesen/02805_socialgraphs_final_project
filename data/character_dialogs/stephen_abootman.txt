thats right spirit what is it that makes canada so important
my fellow canadians for too long we have been pushed around and ridiculed yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding instead canada appreciation day was mocked worldwide
thats right and i think its time for canada to show the world just how bad things would be without it together we can send a message its time for canada to strike
yes every canadian join me join together
what do you think it means were striking buddih no more thats it until we get what we want

yes the world canadian bureau
we want more money
just more money you know canada doesnt get enough money other countries have lots of money we want we want some of that money hu- how about- the internet the internet makes lots of money so give us some of that money
dont give me that fat-cat fancy lip-wiggling are you gonna give canada more money or not
then you leave canada no choice this strike shall continue
one two three four canada deserves more (money) one two three four canada deserves more (money)
