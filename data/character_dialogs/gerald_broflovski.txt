you see kyle we humans work as a society and in order for a society to thrive we need gods and clods
yes you see i spent a lot of time going to law school and i was able to go because i have a slightly higher intellect than others but i still need people to pump my gas and make my french fries and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down
thats right so kennys family is happy just the way they are and were all a functioning part of america
oh yeah love it i havent done it for a while though i had to go out and buy a few things you know a- a rod and a reel and an uh uuh

now just let me do all the talking chef we’re gonna bring these bastards down
i am your honor gerald broflovski
uh-oh
chef thats johnnie cochran hes the guy who knocked oj off
and so in summation ladies and gentlemen of the jury youve heard the version of my clients song recorded over twenty years ago youve heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month id say its pretty much an open-and-shut case make the right decision thank you
weve got em
dammit
he’s using the chewbacca defense
whoops
how was it honey
im sorry honey
what
kidding well thats not funny that hurt my feelings
why
huh
yes
why
kyle wheres your mother
well i have something to give to her dont worry kyle everythings gonna be okay between me and your mom
were rooting for the broncos here jakov
here- here you go and and dont go to the store down the block the one four miles away in fairplay has better pretzels
sorry im late
oh hi kyle
as you can see your honor my client is too upset to continue
all right we did it
hm you know eric ive been thinking uh
uh you know the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools perhaps we should sue them next
well because theyre the ones that let this harassment go on and they have a lot more money i think we could get a lot more out of this than half of stans belongings
mr garrison do you know the definition of sexual harassment
did you or did you not hear my client being called an ass-sucker
and you did nothing
principal victoria were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school
oh so you admit that harassment goes on
you dont know youre the principal
so it does go on
principal victoria was eric cartman called an ass-sucker yes or no
last id like to bring up my expert witness sexual harassment panda
expert witness did south park elementary allow sexual harassment to go on
and whos to blame
there you have it straight from the horses mouth
pan-pandas mouth
all right we did it eric
that goes in the master bedroom well kyle what do you think of your new house
yes it is big isnt it it is very big
well kyle schools have lots of money you see we all pay taxes and part of that tax money goes to public schools and its from that money that we got our 13 million
no its a very fragile system that nature has designed all things flow into each other
sort of yeah
kids are you tired of being harassed at school sick of being called a homo a farty-pants a butt- face then call me kyles dad and ill help you close the lid on sexual harassment in schools
so call me kyles dad because its not about money its about wait what am i saying call me
wow im good
dont answer that
incriminate
well what do you think kyle
well this one is bigger
kyle let me explain something to you
you see kyle we live in a liberal democratic society and democrats make sexual harassment laws these laws tell us what we can and cant say in the workplace and what we can and cant do in the workplace
no because we dont call it fascism do you understand
just look at how big this house is kyle just look at it
thank you your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury everyone has committed a crime here and everyone must pay for that crime my client everyone has been hurt by this crime and must be compensated
your honor id like to make my closing arguments
no dont you see th-the pandas right boy what a great message he has when you sue people you just end up causing a lot of problems for society uhwell ive really learned something today all i could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and i didnt care about where the money came from well im no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools theyre too vague and too easily corruptible thank you sexual harassment panda
yeah well whatever sooo lets not sue anyone again okay come on guys lets go get some ice cream
wow neat
yeah
well screw you guys
yeah i know what you mean
well thats what being young is all about once you have a family and a career your experimenting days are over but tonight is the exception thats why im gonna smoke this cigar only cause ive never smoked before
what havent you tried that youve always wanted to try
yeah was that your leg
yeah
she sure does i wouldnt mind takin that home
i wish thats the one thing ive always thought of experimenting with a threesome
huh well two girls of course i mean with another guy you know thatd be
you havent
well i never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy you know maybe just i dont know masturbate in front of another guy
no no uh i dont think so
sure is
so uh well that was certainly interesting
uh you dont regret doing it now do you
thuh thats right its just harmless experimenting
hey nothing changes between us right i mean were still friends
hey randy what are you doing
can i come with you
randy youre making me feel unimportant talk talk damn you
so so now we cant be friends
we said wed never tell anybody

well uh uh a few people yeah
you didnt say not to tell anyone
listen to you youre yelling at me youve never yelled at me before
hey randy whats up
huh
wulluh uh i just felt like talkin to you
youre having regrets arent you
hey talk to me
i thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldnt change our relationship
hey mr withdrawn you might not need to talk about it but i sure do
having a good time
im not gonna let you change on me randy just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub i wont let it change our friend-
honey
everybody doesnt know and why are you so ashamed of me
i just want to know it meant something to you
so were friends again
i dont know come on kyle youre gonna be late for jew scouts
you see boys jew scouts is a special group that borrows a little bit from all different jewish denominations from the orthodox jews from the hasidic jews from the northern italy cave jews but you have to believe the basic tenets of judaism to be a scout
oh all right just dont let any of the elders know that he isnt jewish okay
ike your brother kyle was in squirts and so was i you have to go so someday you can be a big brave jew scout
tell ike how much fun squirts is kyle
yeah lie

i hate to say it but i think priest maxi was right this is what we get for celebrating halloween and allowing that band korn to come play
yeah i guess so
well kyle thats not a reason to buy something
you see son fads come and go and this "chin-po-ko-mon" is obviously nothing more than a fad you dont have to be a part of it in fact you can make an even stronger statement by saying to your peers "im not going to be a part of this fad because im an individual" do you understand

he was the most upright and honorable of men and every day he praised god
but satan said "oh yeah he only praises you because you gave him so much if you didnt give him those things he would curse your name"
and so god had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter jobs oxen and donkeys and murder all his workers
and then as jobs sons and daughters were eating god sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all
so then job got painful sores all over his body
god said to satan "see i told you job still praises me"
oh uhhh i dont know

i doubt it
jesus
its other-worldly
oh yes there is you could do it again
think about it you werent even trying to take the biggest crap last time imagine if you actually worked at it
thats what were here for
guys we have a problem i talked to the efsm and they say randy has to take the crap in zurich
they say that bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied
but he has his mothers nose
its okay kyle just be a good boy
killing our kids
oh my god sheila come look at this
we have to protect our children from this sheila
twenty percent of american students aged six to twelve say they have tried cheesing at least once kids also refer to it as "the cheese game" or "vitamin cheese" or "mary jane piss in your face fun time" cheesing is spreading fast
i have written up a bill that would make having a cat illegal in the city of south park
with my super lawyer powers we can rid our town of cats so that our kids can never get high again
kyle kyle can we talk to you for a minute please
kyle have you been getting high
then why did your mother find this in your dresser drawer
how long have you been on the cheese
get up to your room right now until your mother and i figure out how to deal with this
now kyle
first thing is weve gotta dispose of this
id better just take it down to the basement for now m-make sure kyle cant find it
no no what am i thinking i shouldnt do this ive been clean for ten years i havent even been near a cat but then that report said our kids were doing it too and and i knew kyle would have the same sicknesses i used to have now a cat is in our home and its too tempting i ill just do it one more time one last time then ill call the police have them pick up the cat and then ill never do it again after this one last time
i couldnt stay away curse your rockin tits
hey everybody good to see you again
huh how come
what get out of here kid
youre too young for this stuff
shes mine you little asshole
i would like to address a personal matter i have let myself down and i would first like to apologize to my lovely wife
and to the people of south park i was wrong and i cant let cats take the fall anymore its our fault the people who use cats for their sweet urine we have to learn that cheesing just isnt worth it sure you get to fight in the breastriary and swim in the fountains of varnov with the itty titty fairies of mammary mountain
and then you fight the boob goblin in the gazongas cave and then the girl may thank you for it but she isnt real
problem is the more you go into that world the more you need to go until you start blowing off all the real people who care about you
cats arent the problem we made cats illegal and and then i cheesed for the first time in ten years and kids are always gonna find a new way to get high like sniffing glue or licking toads or fermenting feces or huffing paint you can also look at-
the point is i was wrong its time to legalize cats heh yeah hooray for gerald hey lets hear it for gerald
randy what happened
come in you can use our internet until you figure out what to do
no no our internet cant be broken ah ive gotta get an attachment larry sent me last night

you were right dildo when you said i was a dick when you called me an asshole i am and now im going to die alone just like you said (starts crying again)
you said i was though cause i only trolled to befunny
really you dont think im a bad person im sorry all you guys im sorry
excuse me hello
could i please speak to the person in charge i have something to say please just for a moment
oh my gosh thank you so much for talking to me i just really needed to get something off my chest im so sorry i had the biggest epiphany about the damage ive done the people ive hurt but the fact of the matter is im not really a troll i actually have a job im a lawyer ive got a loving wife and great kids uhm ive got a family that really misses me and needs me
and that--that is so tragic and im so sorry that she was driven to kill herself by trolling its--its wrong but you know i just sort of set things in motion see im a satirist i challenge peoples point of views by being sort of edgy and sometimes people can be like "whoa" and mistake that for hate but its not hate its pointing out hypocrisies in out society
if you say mean things and youre mean then i agree you should be killed but if youre being funny which spreads joy --
its not
and that was wrong too i certainly want to apologize for that
i-i dont understand
no way
you would--deliberately start world war iii let the people of denmark die set everyone on earth against each other why
thats not funny
you cant do this to people its not right

get out of my way what youre doing is wrong
its completely heartless and malicious
no its not hacking the world to show that most people act differently online isnt even technically satirical
okay okay look what youre doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop right so how is that funny
no but see thats just nihilism
that is
youre trying to get people to go to war and kill each other
i cant argue with you anymore i want to stand here and tell you that you and i are different but its not true
all weve been doing is making excuses for being horrible people
i dont know if you tried to teach me a lesson but you have
i have to stand here and look at you and all i see is a big fat reflection of myself with only one minor difference
ha fuck you what i do is fucking funny bitch

oh d-did something happen
oh well you know they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath the hormones and all that—its been proven theyre literally criminally insane
oh buddy well maybe you could ask the airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers
well… did you guys ever consider your dads
come on in boys
what do you think this one can shoot a thousand bbs in like five seconds
no its safe see as long as your gun has a red tip and youre white police wont shoot you
we need some equipment were gonna try and take out some teenagers
yeah well ive got something bigger american express platinum give me one of everything you have
this army
did you see how those teenagers ran
hey thats what were here for right were just glad you wanted to spend some time with us
