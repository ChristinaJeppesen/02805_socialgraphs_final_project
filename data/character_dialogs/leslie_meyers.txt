thank you kyle
the principal has become our biggest problem we need a news headline that will draw him back to town
we cant just hide kyle we have to let people know pc is the enemy before its too late
the principal is going to try and make up some crazy story thats what pc people do you have to get in front of everyone and tell them what youve learned
but why i came to you because i had heard how good you were at getting messages across that and because i thought you were cute
well i cant go with you you know its too dangerous

gun show
every time you block us we get smarter every time you try to stop us we are more if one plan fails we will plan another you will never be rid of ads
