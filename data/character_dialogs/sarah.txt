im sorry sir but we arent seating anyone who isnt wearing their pajamas
i understand but the management prefers that everyone inside be nice and comfy womfy
sir im just the hostess here if you prefer you only need to wear your pajamas to get in you dont have to wear them at your table while youre actively eating
