it stood above us looking down with these big red eyes-
and i yelled i said "what do you want from us monster" and the monster bent down and said "uh i need about tree-fitty"
three dollars and fifty cents
thats right i said "i aint giving you no tree-fitty you goddamn loch ness monster get your own goddamn money"
she gave him a dollar

august theres a knock on the door i open it and theres this cute little girl scout-
and she says to me "how would you like to buy some cookies" and i said "well what kind do you have" she had thin mints graham crunchy things-
raisin oatmeal and i said "well take a graham crunch how much will that be" and she looks at me and she says "uh i need about tree-fitty"
