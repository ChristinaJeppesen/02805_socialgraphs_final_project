no dog is too much for me to handle i rehabilitate dogs i train people i am the dog wheesperer
so tell me what are the problems you are having with the child
so the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house
see i'm not looking at the child i'm not acknowledging the child i'm just letting the child know i'm not interested in him
see the child thinks your world revolves around him because it does because everything he does gets a response from you
'''' tsst
don't look at the child just keep looking at me let let him know we are having a conversation
'''' tsst
dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck but it works equally well on a child i just use two fingers nip at the child's neck doesn't hurt the child just let him know i am dominant
'''' tsst
'''' tsst see i'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response
i think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise he's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
'''' tsst -we need to let him burn off do you take walks with your son
go on take your son for a walk
see once again i am the one going for a walk it's about me the child is lucky to come along
'''' tsst
don't look at him just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon ''''
here why don't you try it now take your son ''''
good just keep your confidence shoulders back eyes straight ahead the child can pick up on that confidence learning he's supposed to follow you not lead you
good ms cartman very good
it is important to understand that dogs run in packs and one dog is always dominant the pack leader
you must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy
okay let me show you how to express the dominant energy what i have done is i have brought over some kentucky fried chicken ''''
i am going to eat first because that is what the pack leader does ''''
'''' tsst
i am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior now you eat the chicken ''''
we won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior
'''' we need him to become relaxed and submissive
oh no now he's lying you can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant
see
'''' tsst
'''' tsst ''''
'''' tsst ''''
i am not being aggressive i am being dominant
it's okay this is all part of the dominance struggle
let him go he'll be back this a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby ''''
how is the painting going
oh look it came back
well let's feed it
this is more aggressive-dominant behavior don't nurture it
come on ms cartman you must become pack leader what do you do
nooo you're asking him a favor don't ask a favor ''dominate'' ''''
you project the dominant energy and he ''will'' pick up on it i promise shoulder back head high don't reason with it don't argue with it just dominate it
you see you're calm assertive and in control ''''
see this is the behavior we've been looking for this is a relaxed submissive state
good now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention
now you can give him a snack '''' good this is really good now try a command
this is a great first step but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident you are the pack leader now
now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea
so how is your son doing ms cartman
that's greeat
good ms cartman sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend
don't worry when you correct the behavior eventually you will see a change in the personality
how is the child doing
that's much healthier for him and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too
well no my work is done i've got to get back to los angeles
no not really you're just a client well good luck to you gotta go ''''
