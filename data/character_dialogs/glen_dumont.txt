a little to the left okay thats good a little to the right
stand down maam stand down this is a delicate process ive almost earned their trust
how are we doin
weh ah i did manage to get the fda to officially change the word "veal" to "tortured baby cow"
but i couldnt get you north and south dakota
now now please can can we get you to come out
all right everythng has worked out the boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them
yes all we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to denver international airport where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to mexico
and they want the guy that plays mr worf on "star trek" to drive the truck in full makeup
all right all right ill give you that but in return i want three staples
