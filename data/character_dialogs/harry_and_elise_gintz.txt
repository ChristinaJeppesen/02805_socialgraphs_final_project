my wife and i had a child a few years back and we werent ready to have a child so we put him up for adoption we were told that you might be the-
it was a tough time for us it was a tough time for all of canada the whole country was devastated by the cola wars it just seemed we couldnt take care of a baby
we want to take peter home to canada
changing your mind is a canadian custom that we hold quite dear and besides the new canadian prime minister has issued a decree that all adopted canadians must be returned home
he doesnt belong here he belongs in canada with his own kind
please dont make things any harder for peter
were prepared to go to court we had hoped it wouldnt come to that
come on peter we should get going
i have some chocolate
were going to take good care of him
young man you must really care for peter to have come all this way
peter would you like to go back to your home in colorado
