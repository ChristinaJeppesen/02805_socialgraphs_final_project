hello there customer
great what can i get for you large coffee small coffee
oh youre that corporate guy whos been calling
oh forget it my store is not for sale
uh i dont think so my coffee shop is worth a lot to me
the answer is still no mr postum you see when my father opened this store 30 years ago he cared about only one thing making a great cup of coffee sure we may take a little longer to brew a cup and we may not call it fancy names but i guess we just care a little more and thats why tweek coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster yes tweek coffee is a simpler cup for a simpler america
but that could put me out of business
hi officer barbrady
oh just some dong what can i get for you
bye-bye
they want me to sell the store and its so much money
i know but if they open a harbucks right next door we might go out of business they really have my balls in a vice grip
country fresh like the morning after a rainstorm
oh ive got one for you how about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses
no im- serious hon these boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining america you see i own a coffee shop and now a great big multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business which means i may have to shut down and sell my son tweek into slavery
yes slavery
they really have my balls in a salad shooter
wuh-okay but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject
actually honey i think those little tykes are just what we need ive got an idea
hows the report going boys
oh do you need some more coffee
well boys uh i dont mean to pry but if you want it i wrote your report for you
yes its all about corporate takeovers of course you dont have to use it
alright and it can be our little secret about who wrote it right
now when you give the report just make sure that you read this part first okay
and when you come up to do it a second time really really clear it up i mean um really really play the sympathy angle theyll like that theyll be calling you and youll get a passing grade for it
my pleasure gnight boys
yes it is they really have my balls in a juice maker oh hello son uh how did your report go
really well son you might have just saved the family business what do you have to say about that
i know how you boys feel sometimes a hot cup of french roast amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day that smooth aroma and mild taste is what make tweek coffee uh very special special like an arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew a light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt--
what
oh sorry here you go
oh hello committee members what a surprise
yes how did you hear
oh youll do fine son
wow it its great
what do you think hon hon whats the matter
what do you mean
but kids are great to get people on our side
honey alls fair in love and war and coffee hon hu-hon
uh mr postum im afraid youve got a lot to learn about making coffee
uh im sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow and if the law passes youre gonna be thrown out of town
at five oclock the best coffee wins either your coffee or a fresh warm cup of tweeks coffee like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age you can count on tweeks coffee to start your day
hey hey that is good
its subtle and mild mild like that first splash of sun on an april morning this coffee is coffee the way it should be
thank you mr postum but i think well be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery
just kidding son
how was school today son
thats great
son let me tell you a little story about when your mother and i first met you see a long time ago there were a lot of guys who were after your mother she used to be very attractive
well when i started courting your mother there was this big muscular football player named quib who didnt take too kindly to me he wanted your mother all to himself and so one day he challenged me to a fight
ohd i i dont know he moved away or something
tweek calm down have some coffee
we can let them go can we
well sure thats easy for you to say your sons dead but those of us with alive children need to be sure that father maxis on the up-and-up
uh sh-sh here he comes here he comes
thats a good idea im gonna be an atheist too
you too tweek
atheism has definitely made our lives better
oh thanks sharon
thats true if im gonna raise my son to be atheist i dont want him saying "under god" every day at school that could really damage him "under god" should be taken out of the- uh scuse me moowwaaagh "under god" should be taken out of the pledge of allegiance

tweek
calm down son remember what dr norris told you find your center
sit down and have some coffee son tweek theres starting to be a lot of reports in the news about children being abducted and we thought we should talk
now we dont want to alarm you son but weve installed new locks on your bedroom windows and door its important for you to know never to unlock them at night for anyone except your mother and i
you failed the test son didnt i tell you not to open the door for anybody except your mother and i
he would have sprayed your brains all over the floor and then taken your body off to the woods youve got to be on your toes tweek alright now go to bed and get some rest
