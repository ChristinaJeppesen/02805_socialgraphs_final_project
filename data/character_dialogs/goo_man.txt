are you the owner of this restaurant
id like to do business with you your establishment here is perfect for my plant-based meats you see i am a goo man if you carry my product incredible meats we can put the word incredible before all of your dishes
that is correct
thats right
that is most excellent now how many customers on avarage do you have per day
thats it
what is tegridy burger
is that so
ive been in your town a little while now what i see is a community that is ready for change you see i am a goo man what i serve in your school cafeteria is a synthetically-modulated plant protein i have taken over nearly all the fast food restaurants here in town and teamed up with the fine people in your community this my new regional manager hw
shut up hw you see im trying to reach all the school cafeterias all the stadiums fast food restaurants all the places that serve shitty food and serve shitty goo the goo for these kind of places is made in a factory its made in a lab its just down-market goo but i can tell people its healthy and earth friendly and i can send my goo through a network of pipes running all the way to the ocean so that it can be eaten by people who eat crappy food anyway -- from coast to coast
but you see it doesnt work unless i own all the crappy food places mr rancher
have you done what ive asked you to do
well if you dont mind boys i have work to tend to
