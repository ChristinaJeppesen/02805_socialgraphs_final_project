well hello there little girl my name is dr hallis what can i do for you today
you
well young lady im afraid that we dont offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age
because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing making them smaller is insane
why do you hate your breasts so
oh come on now thats just silly
oh awesome thank you so much jillian thats great oh god-damn thank you so much
yeah whatever get out of here now i was saying
yeah so thats great isnt it
that may be true but im afraid i just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl
if on the other hand youd like to make them a little bigger i think now might be the right time to size up hm
young lady are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts
well it is a different time mrs testaburger society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best having small breasts can make her feel unimportant
yes well not too young to feel flat and therefore not pretty
however young lady im afraid breast implants are not for everyone ill need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go
you pass lets do this thing
suuure breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure what we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it wont be seen then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water
look us plastic surgeons have one philosophy if we can help someones self-esteem a little then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars
cha gotta jam it up there get in there you bitch get in there you bitch hah okay theres one wendy doing great
