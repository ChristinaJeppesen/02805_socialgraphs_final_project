alright listen up my name is pc principal i dont know about you but frankly im sick and tired of how minority groups are marginalized in todays society im here because this place is lost in a time warp students who still use the word "retarded" a teacher who said women without wombs should get an aids test
a chef "person of color" who the children had sing soul songs and who the children drove to kill himself
and thats two days detention for you young man well see you at 4
let me ask you this were in colorado right where are the hispanic kids huh where are the ethnic and racial minorities
and thats two days detention for you mackey congratulations
i googled south park before i came here and i cannot believe the shit youre getting away with people claiming to be advocates of transgender rights but really just wanting to use the womens bathroom a white man who thinks hes chinese and built a wall to keep out mongolians
what the fuck is this are you fucking kidding me im telling you all this is done like it or not pc is back and its bigger than ever weoo-weoo-weoo you hear that thats the sound of 2015 pulling you over people suck it
have a seat ive been talking with your child and were gonna be giving him two weeks detention
your son said some things to a fourth-grade girl that frankly make me wanna puke now that im principal im not gonna allow anyone at this school to be made feel unsafe and harassed
youll have to excuse my language "i dont think caitlyn jenner is a hero" this kind of transphobic and bigoted hate speech isnt gonna fly here bro well i though we were all on board that caitlyn jenner is an amazing beautiful woman who had the exquisite bravery of a butterfly flying against the wind and then this shit comes out of peoples mouths
you got a fuckin problem bro
cause its not bruce fuckin jenner its caitlyn and shes a fuckin stunning woman or maybe youre the one teaching him to demean women in the first place huh whats up whats fuckin up bro
get the fuck out of here dude
hey what seems to be the problem here gentlemen
im pc principal
no way theres more pc bros here
sweet bros texas a&m bro i had no idea there were like-minded individuals in this town that defended social minorities we should all hang out
what are you doing in the faculty bathroom
what the fuck are you talking about
what
what did you just say
"capiche" youre associating italian-americans to intimidation tactics youd better watch your micro-aggressions bro
did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation
did you just say "spokesman" instead of "spokesperson" when women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege
do you think italian-americans and women are less important
you dare to use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with verbal biases like yours on a daily basis
all right pledgies were excited you wanna try and be pc we hope youve got what it takes to join the most socially active group in america
you know theres still some people out there that say "what does being pc really mean" well ill tell you what it means it means you love nothin more than beer workin out and that feelin you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression
all right pledges listen up congratulations on making it to the final cuts
now its time for the final test so what youre gonna have to do to prove you belong with pc is go out there and check someones privilege
topher can you explain "check your privilege" please
yeah see theres some people out there like brett fucking favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud caitlyn jenner at the espy awards he can get away with one of these bullshit claps its called "clapping" favre what the fuck are you doing washing your hands youre either on board or youre not bro now if hes gonna bring shame on someone then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him
no cause theres somebody even worse now
i gotta hand it to you marsh you really checked that little boys privilege using those syrian refugees was genius bro
youre not only pc youve actually changed my pc congrats heres your oakleys
hey bro im the new principal of the school my names pc principal
thats right
you know i think its changed a lot i really do ive seen some real progress definitely had some holdouts - people who went kicking and screaming into 2015 but yes i think they deserve it
so these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed
alright why dont you take me back to what happened
hey you got a fuckin problem mackey
because body-shaming is fuckin serious and im not gonna allow that shit in my school nobody should have to feel that kind of shame
morning kyle have a seat right there you probably heard that eric here has been dealing with some body shaming
well eric and i have been talking and weve decided its probably best for him to get off of social media
so what were looking for is a student volunteer somebody who can put the things eric wants up on the internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him
thats right
kyle you know what body-shaming is right how much it can hurt someones life all you have to do is check out all the comments type out just the positive ones and give that to eric on paper
okay kyle well maybe youd like two weeks detention instead
you sure about that
thats two weeks detention for you bud ill see you at 4 and when we said someone should probably help eric by filtering out any negative comments he mentioned you by name
nothing funny about this testaburger this is a big problem in our country
and thats two weeks detention for you congratulations so any comments that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way you need to delete and not include in your daily report to eric
you want detention
then you start today butters its your job to make sure eric has a safe space
alright everyone listen up in order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming we have a- hey leslie put a fuckin sock in it we have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty so please welcome action star and hero steven seagal
hey seagal listen that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids
i can see that youre in a lot of pain bro ive got someone who i think can help
so i want you to do for mr seagal the same thing that youre doing for eric cartman
this man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness i think you can give him a little of your time
you know if theres one thing i really respect its plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful these ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie and we wanna make sure theyre protected from any harassing comments
hey theyre gonna putting themselves out there and all im asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean
i know its a lot but i just really need you to help these plus-sized models and vin diesel
look bro youve done an amazing job with eric cartman you have really turned his life around and other people deserve to be as happy as he is
your safe spaaaace
look and you will see theres a very select crowd in your safe spaaaace
i guess i asked too much of one kid
alright everyone listen up today were going to be showing you some art from our asian-american students-dammit leslie shut your fucking pie-hole from our asian-american students presented by our student-body president wendy testaburger
alright guys i know there have been a lot of rumors flyin around just wanted to check in see if you have any questions for me
whats wrong with being gay nothin wrong with that
that is completely irrelevant okay what matters and the reason i brought you in here is that you understand affirmative consent
if there is a romantic relationship here you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration
now in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier but you still have to follow some guidelines alright
i dont care about that bro tweek if and im only saying if at some point you wanted to touch craigs penis you cant just go grabbin for it alright you need to say something like "craig is it alright with you if i touch your penis" okay lets try it out
you want two weeks detention instead this shits important
okay good now craig you might say "you may touch my penis im comfortable with that" or of course you could say "no you may not touch my penis at this time"
okay now were getting somewhere now craig what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at tweeks asshole
hello mr tucker i need to inform you that your son was in an altercation at school today
yes with his boyfriend just a lovers quarrel probably
something to be expected in relationships apparently there were no affirmative consent issues as your son knows the right way to play with another boys penis
theres not gonna be any disciplinary action since they are gay we wanna be supportive so were just gonna send them on home with some money alright alright you have a nice day
there she is officers right there i told you to stop chatting with your friend didnt i leslie you see officers apparently leslie thinks that talking to her friends is more important than learning about diversity in third-world countries that one thats her right there you remove her from my school
get her out of here
waaaah
who was it somebodys about to get their asses kicked when i find out who did this
who was it huh somebody better fess up right now im gonna find out who did this broflovski was it you
i just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word "retarded" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy the word "retarded" does not belong in our school who is in charge of the school paper cause im about to break their fuckin legs
alright uhh i i guess we havent formally met before uhh the reason i need to talk with you jason is because of a very important-
alright jim thank you i want to talk to you today about the use of the r word in your school paper you see the r word is very bad
says me right now i know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities when you use the r word to describe the schools lunch policy it can hurt peoples hearts can you understand that at all
okay well from now on im gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out okay
whatd you say
look i dont wanna get angry okay
no im not i am very not uncomfortable alright look unless i can approve your paper it is not being distributed on campus you got that
not unless it is approved by me do you understand

who does this kid think he is challenging me i said one micro-aggression to him okay one little micro-aggression but that doesnt mean i have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities
but why would a person with a disability not see that what im trying to do is actually protect them
youre right this kid just needs to be shown hes being an uncle abel i can always count on my pc frat brothers to have my back lets go pc
alright jim i know youve been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday im sure youre feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself
okay well no you are confused-
because you dont grasp the severity of this and thats why i brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings thanks for comin in to talk to us nathan
me too bro me too nathan could you tell jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word "retarded"
you feel bad right you feel like thats a no-no word right
okay wow thats pretty heavy pretty heavy huh jim
i am not uncomfortable i simply care about a horrible outdated word that is exclusive ignores individuality and equates intellectual disa-bility with being and its and its s-spot i need a spotter spot me somebody spot me bro
alright everyone listen up tonight is a very special night for the pcs were honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities i for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in todays society but tonight is about learning and healing so lets get to it pc
mckinsey you got consent forms
rise and shine guys if you scored last night ill need your consent forms thank you thank you thank you-whoa barker did you perform cunnilingus theres a different release form bro
nice
what bro
yeah
naturally
what the fuck is this bro
thats not true
that little fucker dude
alright thats good everyone get inside everything past here is safe space no reporters no harassment we are gonna figure this shit out all i know is that i dont speak up for minorities so that i can crush pussy
pc people are under attack thats what this is
no topher its not about puss alright the fuck is wrong with you were being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper
yeah and like if youre gonna belittle and make fun of pc people like that then whos to say he wont do it to other marginalized groups like us i mean this kid could be the next hitler and if you guys could stop hitler what would you do
nooo
i came to this town really thinking i could make a difference ive been called a bigot towards persons with disabilities ive been called pussy-crusher because of the behavior of a very few individuals in my pc frat jimmy valmer is off the school newspaper i want you to take over
and i will be reviewing your paper to make sure nobody is ever attacked the way i was again
jimmy almost made me lose confidence but i know who i am i know what i am
yeah
pc bro 11
dude what the fuck bro
bro what the fuck bro
what the hell is going on bro
bro what the hell is going on bro
alright everyone listen up i dont know about you but i for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others
you know if theres one thing that makes me sick its when a race thinks theyre superior and dont know how to check their privilege
an african-american flips a turtle over on its back a transgender filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun what color is the filipinos father i didnt think you were human
you wouldnt believe me if i told you
i dont know what they are but they used me and others like me to try and change this planet
huh aint that a peach
hey leslie your species took pc and twisted it for evil purposes that pisses me off youre expelled
alright everyone listen up i dont know about you but i for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species we have a new enemy out there an almost invisible foe that is so bigoted so racially biased they actually think we should all die they are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair but no matter how hard they hit us we cannot let them take from us our pc and so i have been asked to stay on as your principal a lot of changes will happen in the coming months the bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who dont is that we have the burning desire for social justice we are at war but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding non-biased and politically correct as possible
alright ladies first of all i wanna say that i completely respect your decision to protest our national anthem thought it was sweet i believe you shed some light on some very important issues regarding gender equality
ladies i understand youre upset about the trolling youve received on the internet but there is no evidence that eric cartman is skankhunt42
well he claims that hes been working at changing himself and the world around him send in mr cartman
mr cartman im gonna ask you one more time are you or are you not the internet troll skankhunt42
alright boys ive had just about enough of playing games the four of you were good friends with eric cartman and yet none of you seem to know why he left social media nobodys got anything to say well i have a theory i think that eric cartman was somehow forced to leave social media as a retaliation for heidi turner quitting social media now because of the actions of one sexist bigoted racist troll
we have a gender war on our hands make no mistake gentlemen our community is under attack and if we dont get to the bottom of it theres gonna be more students like eric cartman wandering the hallways with no connection to the rest of the world
make no mistake i want to be very upset however as a community we have all decided that people have the right to protest the national anthem
correct but they did so peacefully and without malice towards others
i want you to understand something ladies i am in a pc pretzel here because if i say they cant protest even though you protested and the only difference is that their protest included physical gestures then im body shaming
thats what happens when you sit out the national anthem
alright everyone listen up this school is falling apart and it needs to stop boys are harassing girls and girls are stereotyping boys as- not now mr stotch put it away
now ive asked for some ideas and a couple of students wanna try and help please welcome heidi and eric
alright everyone listen up i know that many of us were shocked to the core with last nights election but we cannot allow our school to be any further divided it is time to try and start the healing process and so here to try and help us heal is bill clinton
god dammit how the fuck did this happen
i told you to leave me alone mackey im not in the mood
uh not at all please uh have a seat mr garrison
uh please have a seat mr president
certainly want to uh congratulate you on the election
i know weve had some differences uh
im sorry that your position here at the school was terminated

all right everyone listen up today were gonna have a performance by one of our students who has written a song the song is about his feelings towards the current political climate with north korea put your hands together for tweek
all right next up we have hannah williams with her rendition of "wheels on the bus"
entree yes eric how can i help you
well unfortunately this week is distracted driving awareness week at school so you might have a hard time
a lot of people theres more deaths now because of people on their phones while driving than ever before
entree vous
gary borkovec was a good student he didnt deserve to be taken away by someone not paying attention to the road
i dont know what more you want from me bro
i can give you two student volunteers and one pigeon
maybe you should
maybe you should
all right everyone listen up tonight one of our students has put together a song about a very important issue its a song about how there are certain times to not be on your phone i hope you all listen carefully
excuse me can i help you
thats right the science fair is this saturday from 10 am to 2 pm
oh dude bro
all right everyone listen up give me your attention please due to circumstances beyond our control we are cancelling the special ed science fair
alright everyone listen up as you know theres been a lot of bullying and insensitivity at our school to counteract this it is my firm belief that south park elementary is in desperate need of s a strong woman so in looking for a new vice principal we wanted to find a powerful intelligent and independent female to be a role model for us all and with that said id like to introduce our new vice principal strong woman
hey stotch you do not disrespect strong woman by talking when shes talking
oh uh i was just making sure everything was uh-
shit i mean no sorry sorry im not u- uh here you go
from everyone
no no sorry i thought id add just add for emphasis
no-i im uh im sorry
alright now if we have any q-
right right uh im sorry every- pay attention everybody
alright everyone listen up as you all know weve been looking for a strong woman to take on the role of vice principal at this school we couldnt be happier with the selection weve made and were sure shell be making our school a better place so with that let me turn over the floor to our new vice principal strong woman
e-excuse me everyone i um i need to get to the restroom sorry ill be right back
thats right im pc principal
im uh having this problem with my ears theres like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on
its um hootie & the blowfish
yeah uh ahem theres a new woman that has joined our faculty her name is strong woman and uh she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears
no that couldnt be it we work in the same place so it would be impossible for me to like her im thinking theres some sort of device in my ears
oh dude bro
uh yes yes mackey um i just wanted to see how you thought it was going with strong woman
do you know uh do you know if strong woman has a boyfriend
no-nothing just forget it
i just wanted to know because shes unavailable then maybe i can get my head off of her alright
i dont know how it happened i know its inappropriate and yet i cant stop thinking about her i think im sick
hr is that like hootie removal
alright everyone listen up as you know we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the devil to act upon them so weve been reaching out to human resources division as i think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isnt considered misconduct she has some great advice for us so please welcome heather conduct go ahead miss conduct
all right military alert everyone lets get to the hallways and get the students to the gymnasium come on lets move
you heard her move it people i have to make sure all the classes are empty you go take cover with the kids
alright come on oh no
vice principal woman i need to ask you something
this is very difficult but uh
well as you can see theres a door in front of us
i would like to open this door for you however i understand the gender-based biases this can imply
i dont need to open the door id just be opening it and holding it the same way i would for counselor mackey a student anyone else
uh we sort of have some bigger problems right now mr uh
uh yes we are here with our student of the day to reward him lunch with the principal and vice principal
is it my fault that i found the most amazing perfect beautiful womanat work
maybe they will were co-worker who are in love you really think thats going to bother people
i understand that there have been some problems here at the school lately a lot of students are experiencing anxiety and eric cartman just wanted to be able to voice his concerns go ahead eric
how exactly did tolkien manipulate your grades eric
is that true tolkien did you do somethin to make eric fail a test
vice principal strong woman
i was seeing if theres anything you might want to discuss with me
i am- so sorry- that i took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter
are you sure we can move forward
i was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from-
you dont think theres anything else to dis- to discuss
all right everyone listen up the vice principal has asked to speak with you today she believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization
thats right strong woman in todays society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man
st-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "whos the father"
you- you all right strong woman
so-so wed like to have all our students talk to their parents tonight about in-vitro fertilization and after that lets just put the whole issue behind us
its okay well be at the hospital soon just keep breathing
im just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need
i certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female but at times i wonder if there is more we should discuss
that she is
oh dude bro
i think its wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age
whats that
doctor would it be possible for me to hold the pc babies
vice principal
shh its okay the babies are fine resting in the nursery theyre the most theyre the most pc babies ive ever seen
look i was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate-
n-not took advantage you know what im saying
all i want to do is help we can say im the manny and if anyone has a problem with that then they have a problem with gender biases and they can take it up with me we can keep the truth about the babies totally hidden
oh yes very good vice principal see that it is done by back to school night
i am the manny anyone have a problem with that
is everything all right
oh no were from uh missouri
all right please move along folks we dont want the babies to get excited
theyre so strong like their mother
can they ever know that im their dad
then ill just try to be the best principal to them that i possibly can
im busy
im busy doing stuff what
uh-uh yes
uh yeah we just uh were having an important scheduling to go over
thats in the past mackey weve paid our dues and were not hiding anything anymore
whats going on
all right what word did you use riley
look cant we put them in a daycare
well maybe they wont
i dont know what makes you think youre different from everyone else but nobody gets away with slandering teachers at this school
hey hey
just what do you think youre doing
there are no boxes on your head in school
what are you talking about
oh hey i just needed to answer a couple of e-mails really fast
i got one for you too its buddha box look you and i have been having a lot of problems clearly what we both need is more quality one-on-one time with our phones
im sorry i was trying to be helpful
its okay were gonna find them
you were on your phone too
youre seriously gonna make this all my fault
because last time i checked you didnt even want me around as a partner to the pc babies even though i-
even though you need me to do shit for you every 10 fuckin minutes you dont get to just say whatever you- oh okay cool fine with me im the one who has a fuckin problem on their fuckin phone you know usually im afraid to tell you what i really think but you wanna know something you wanna- you wanna know what i really think
im her superior at work
you think i took advantage of my position
im not harvey weinstein all right i have nothing but respect for females at my workplace and i would never compromise that position
tha-thats bailey
cone on
kids
yea and ah-im their principal we need to get these kids back to school
oh my god they had their first protests and we missed it we missed everything because we were on our phones
you know what we have to do right
all right everyone listen up the vice principal and i have been discussing student health and its our firm belief that they need and what we all need is less time on our phones yes yes i know its an unpopular idea but just hear me out please our phones are the cause of stress not the relief from it we are banning phones and buddha boxes and we suggest you all strictly limit their use at home as well
yeah nobodys listening and nobodys watching
alright everyone listen up as you know there are several students protesting the school menu but there are other students who are voicing their concerns against changes eric cartman is still recovering in the hospital we all wish him well now the school has been looking into several options to deal with the problem and i do believe we have found a compromise we have found a new company in the plant-based fast-food industry who would like to be the supplier for our cafeteria and so please welcome the founder of incredible meat
alright everyone listen up halloween has almost arrived and i wanna make sure that we are all aware of certain guidelines when it comes to halloween costumes at school now i dont wanna see any fucking sombreros alright if i see any fucking mexican sombreros or anyone fucking dressed like a fucking native american im gonna lose my fuckin shit there will be no hobos or bums anything depicting people from low-income households
and lastly heed my fuckin words if i see any of you girls dressed as fucking moana im gonna lose my fucking mind alright now the student book fair is coming up next week we encourage all students to be able to-
yeah whos strong
whos strong woman
youre gonna smoke the competition
kids kids okay what the matter
they dont like mulan
okay okay we know mulan is outdated in creating straw dog characters to talk about trans issues daddys turning it off
alright everybody listen up as you know this school is a place where everyone should feel included our challenge is to motivate ourselves and others to create an inviting non-negative and hey stotch you got a fucking problem
now i think that what we all need are leaders who motivate by example and so i would like to inform you all that your vice-principal is competing in the strong woman competition in morrison this weekend lets hear it for her
or those who identify as girls
so second place thats pretty damn good
i guess she just started identifying as a woman a few weeks ago doesnt really seem fair
ill get it
uh shes sort of busy right now ms swanson
yeah you already told her that at the competition
look why dont you just get out of here
dont you dare im trans peoples biggest supporter what i think you are is a terrible sport
youd better knock it off
and if you dare call me transphobe again im gonna-
are you feeling what im feeling
i dont know what it is but something about that woman just doesnt seem right
hey dont let her get to you strong
i i-i dont know why she has such a grudge against you and i-
what do you mean
what
but then she doesnt really care about trans people or women
i didnt even know people like that existed
alright alright thats enough you uh you made your point heather we get it okay
look everyone i know were all a little afraid to have any opinions on this stuff but um there can be situations where its not so easy to what i mean is i
yeah no shit cause you went through puberty as a male so your bodys completely different
i told you not to call me a transphobe all i want is to have a discussion
aw shit
yes your sabbatical was somewhat controversial
well that is the problem mr garrison as someone who previously identified as president there could be safety issues
uh thank you for your application mr garrison well keep you in mind as a backup but hopefully the vaccination process is going to start opening up
whats going on here students
hey you kids know that these teachers are doing their very best for your benefit
i am sick and tired of students thinking they can walk all over their teachers who gave you everything they got
i tell you what else this friday for pajama day at school this class does not get to wear their pajamas you heard me no pajama day for this class now maybe youll remember to have some respect for your teacher
yeah
alright send em in
im sorry ladies ive made a decision and im sticking to it
i appreciate your sentiment but as principal of the school its my job to make decisions and stand by them to maintain order
hey how many times have i told you kids not to bring up nazi germany when you dont get something you want
get out
i cant believe the things these students say sometimes
what
if i change my mind now i look weak
yes hello ms cartman this is the school principal returning your call what can i do for you
your son is part of a class that lost their pajama day privilege correct
well ive already made my decision and its final
ms cartman if you are worried about your sons safety then perhaps you should just keep him home for pajama day
im sorry
testaburger
i need to talk to you now
ms testaburger i need you to get me out of this
i made a tactical decision now if i go back and say maybe i was wrong i look weak
zip it i need you to get everyone in your class to work together and have mr garrison come to me saying your pajama day should be reinstated you get the girls and the boys to work together this is your problem now testaburger
whats going on students
what the fuck bro
bro what am i supposed to do do you know what a principle is a principle is something that you see as a fundamental truth you do something that you think is right out of principle thats why i wanted to be principal tell your class they can run back home and put on their pajamas ill hand in my resignation this afternoon
youre totally wrong about that when all these people see i caved in to their insults and their offensive world war ii comparisons ill be done
no you– wait what did you say
no what day is opposite day at school
testaburger thats it
attention all students this is your principal i need to inform you that a mistake has been made mr mackey your counselor totally screwed up the calendar today is not pajama day it is in fact opposite day so we will be having breakfast for lunch in the cafeteria and anything else youve been told to do you can now do the opposite
alright everyone listen up we have a special announcement today one of our fourth grade students says hes done a lot of work and has grown as a person and hed like to share his journey with you please welcome stan marsh
mr mackey id like to have a word with you
i see that youve uh called for another nuclear emergency drill this afternoon
well mr mackey this is the seventh drill that weve done in two days and i see that you also put in the budget for a bomb shelter and 20 vhs copies of "red dawn"
mr mackey im starting to worry that this is sort of nostalgic for you like youre kind of enjoying this
you speak russian
mr mackey i am not asking you im telling you – stop with all the drills and stop putting ideas into our students heads
okay
