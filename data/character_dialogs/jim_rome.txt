randy first off thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare way to go
well it certainly makes for an exciting game how about last nights nail-biter that ended zero to zero thats a game i wanna watch twice thats a game i wanna watch four times check that ill watch that game five times good luck on sunday im sure thatll be another game that i could watch twelve times check that thirteen times
jim rome here hey i love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy but sometimes its so thrilling i need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game thats when i reach for a bottle of this butters creamy goo
get with it and get the goo
welcome back to rome some of you might have seen me on tv last night turns out the drink i endorsed was semen turns out a little kid was just bein sarcastic that kids probably grounded for a month check that im sure hes grounded for two months and a week football needs to be made safer so why dont we have players in bras drinking semen yeah thats a fastball right there thats a real stroke of philosophic genius more little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football and i dont know what else to say but "so long sarcastaball it was nice knowin you" lets just hope nothin like this ever happens again probably wont not for another year check that couple of days
