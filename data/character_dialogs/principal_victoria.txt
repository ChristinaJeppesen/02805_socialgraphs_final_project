mr garrison last weeks charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
you see that parents your children have refused to come into class since this morning im afraid your son is the leader ms cartman apparently hes read the entire bible and now hes scaring the hell out of everyone
dont listen to them kids you have to go to school
oh this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts
well miss choksondik those children did fairly well in the third grade
oh which one
im afraid thats impossible nobodys seen mr garrison since the last school year ended
wuh sure thing fine bye-bye then
whattaya think too forward
waaah
as we said before thats impossible
and then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy
he finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and went up into the mountains to live in solitude
but he could be anywhere up high in those mountains
mr garrison
you admit it you admit it
well congratulations
oh im sorry we dont hire gay people
yeah i swore that if i had to see it one more time id put a bullet in my head but luckily i got really stoned before i came
oh oh haha wow
oh wow
oh oh wow wowuh
ah ms choksondik can we have a quick word with you
and so apparently theres been a little mixup the manatees were meant to go to the denver shelter aquarium and the frogs were meant to come here
congratulations how do you feel
oh
oh looks like the weather might turn shitty
okay parents i know a lot of you want a chance to speak but we have to talk one at a time
school policy has been to teach sexual education later in the fifth grade
teachers i have some bad news last night i received a phone call from the local pharmacist apparently almost all of our fourth graders are sexually active and now that weve scared them a little theyre buying condoms to use
but how old do you think a student should be when they learn about proper condom use
i guess we have no choice
then its decided no more condom classes in grade school
hello boys
yes mr garrison have a seat mr garrison sometime ago you asked to be promoted from teaching kindergarten back to the third grade
i wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences it was wrong of us and i want to make it up to you
as you know the position of fourth grade teacher has become available and wed like to offer you the job
we in administration see now that you are an individual with your own preferences and we respect that
i know you will
its for real mr garrison
with all the new laws we could never fire you for being gay now youd be able to sue us for millions of dollars
well i was just saying that the policies have really changed you know we fire you for acting gay next time youd be able to sue the school district for lots of money
oh well there was the case out in minnesota where the guy was awarded 25 million i think
mr garrison to the principals office please
oh yes uh mr garrison have a seat
mr garrison chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods
no no no were not firing you
no were sending chef to a tolerance seminar
you demonstrate a lack of tolerance for mr garrisons behavior in fact i believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class
i just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to mr garrison before i send you away chef
no no i think i have a better idea
im sorry mr garrison but its obvious you arent tolerant of your own behavior
all right will you people stop barging into my office please
get him out of here
luckily for us one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward
okay thank you kyle broflovski
all right students members of the school board our last speaker will discuss the important role of latinos in the arts here is eric cartman eric cartman
oh jesus christ

j-lo can we get a picture of you with the kids
filthy bastard native american money
well you boys have certainly done it this time
not as sorry as youre going to be when your parents get here ah here they come now
come on in
youd better brace yourself parents the boys were caught smoking
weve simply had it with your son mr and mrs marsh voting just doesnt appear to be important to him
well my hands are tied we can no longer have stans behavior jeopardizing the other children he must be removed
no im afraid its worse than that by county law im bound to enforce the harshest punishment possible
no banishment
you can appeal to the city council but i dont think itll do any good your son must leave south park never to return
oh my goodness
well i we
fine
mr garrison for the love of god
mr mackey its over
shh quiet students quiet
yes we need to go over it again in the classroom so they understand what really happened
mr mackey clydes parents are here
eric cartman report to the principals office immediately
come on in eric
eric the reason we called you in here is because it is your turn to be the school hallway monitor
if anyone doesnt you have the authority to bring them to me
"ike i long to feel your arms around me" miss stevenson you- youre having a relationship with this student
this is unbelievable
miss stevenson i will need to inform the police
mrs garrison evolution is in the school curriculum we have to teach it
our students want to learn mrs garrison and theyre mature enough to handle anything
mr triscotti i wasnt aware that-
sir if you dont wish your daughter to learn about evolution then we can pull her out of class
it has become obvious to me that you dont know enough about evolution to teach it im having you replaced mr dawkins
richard dawkins is a world-renowned evolutionary scientist
you are to sit in class and help mr dawkins with whatever he needs
mrs garrison i am pulling you out of the classroom
very well but there is to be no more throwing of feces understood
yes we apologize for eric cartmans behavior mr nelson we feel terrible
very well mr nelson stacey go ahead and send in eric cartman eric mr nelson is concerned about how you respond to little people
mr nelson
all students are to evacuate the school immediately
good morning eric
its okay eric we all understand and we think youre very brave
i understand its been difficult mrs garrison and so mr donaldson has come from the tourettes tolerance and understanding foundation
no
thank you for coming everyone
boys please take a seat
boys the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends has a serious illness eric cartman has been diagnosed with hiv
all right were going to bring eric in now and lets all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love okay
all right boys now what is this fighting all about
what
is that true eric did you give kyle aids
did you infect kyle with the hiv virus yes or no
thats right i think you owe kyle an apology
youre sorry for what eric
thats better and now kyle maybe you should also admit you were wrong for tattling
wendy testaburger to the principals office please wendy testaburger to the principals office
wendy ive been hearing rumors about a fight between you and eric cartman
oh no are you sure
i see ive noticed all the things youve done for breast cancer awareness month did you know im a breast cancer survivor
i was diagnosed seven years ago cancer is pure evil it is a fat little lump that needs to be destroyed when there is a cancer you have to "fight" it you cant reason with cancer you cant wish it away cancer doesnt play by the rules so neither can you
and you cant listen to what anybody else tells you you have to be willing to give up everything because the cancer will take everything do you understand
when you have cancer you fight because it doesnt matter if you beat it or not you refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless
now kids i understand that you are very into this "vampire" thing but i dont want to see it get out of hand you kids need to understand that your new little fad is scary to some
i know that you arent really vampires and i appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now but-
-but just make sure that this new little trend doesnt become a distraction
i was just telling your friends about what i expect of your-
now hold on a minute i think were being a little drastic here you know i probably see a boy in my office once a week for farting on a girl
im very sorry but im afraid we have to terminate your employment here at south park elementary
the school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter like murder and abortion
im sorry the board has made up their minds
that isnt the only reason youre being let go
we found all the gay porn on your iphone mr conners
the job is to read what is written on the paper eric not to embellish the way you do
no its just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work
all we ask is you keep it shorter
eric weve been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school
eric ive had enough you cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds do i make myself clear
stan marsh to the principals office stan marsh come to the principals office immediately
did you call him a fudge packer
but you started it mr broflovski tell him what you told us
but why is mr mackey doing this now
i told you the students would be interested in how much they grew since their last physical
eric cartman to the principals office immediately
youre darn right eric
why did you measure all the boy students penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board
what
wait are you talking about the numbers we published tuesday from the physicals
the numbers we put up were height differentials
we thought it would be fun to put up how much each student has grown in height since their physical last year you grew 12 inches
why would we publish the lengths of our students private parts
we didnt
this is exactly the kind of thing we are always talking about eric you get angry about something you dont think and you cause bad things to happen this time youve done it to yourself
because you have an anger problem eric
thank you for coming parents we called you in because weve had a little incident at the school the fourth grade boys measured their penises and posted results in the school hallway
now we realize this issue can have a troubling effect that can get blown out of proportion
now now boys fascination with their genitalia is a natural thing we simply need to find a way to help the students understand what theyve done
okay before we get started with this pta meeting does anyone have any outstanding issues
hows it going coach
so youre happy with these changes
okay
im sorry but your son is distracting the other students and his attitude is just getting worse
eh-excuse me
ah im sorry i really dont understand
ooookay thank you cheerleaders that was very nice ahhh next we have a student who would like to perform an original rap song based on his award-winning poem "i was not the bullet" with backup music by butters stotch
mr mackey so far the school has spent $22000 on the intellilink system and so far its been an unmitigated disaster
oh noo
kyle these men have apparently come all the way from israel to speak with me but we need a translator
ohh what does he need
for what what did he say kyle
all right everyone thanks for coming as you know we urgently need to discuss the matter of butters stotch who set fire to the school gymnasium and is now asking to come back are we all set to start
well you have to admit he does look a little better
in the cheeks you dont think he looks a little fuller
yes mr mackey were all aware that youre gluten-free now
right so the issue as you all know is that butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off
really mwell i might just give this gluten-free thing a try how does it work
yes will there be gluten-free options for people at this party
well ive been gluten-free for about a day now and i have to say i feel sooo amazing i just want to make sure theres food for all of us
i want to know just what makes you think its okay to go inside the girls bathroom
you are not transgender eric you dont even know what that means
all right well if you identify yourself as a girl you must find yourself attracted to boys is that right
alright listen eric
listen eric you must know why we cant have you in the girls bathroom
with the what
but this isnt a hurt and confused child were talking about this is eric cartman
sooo eric cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate
erica i believe we have a solution to this little problem
if it is agreeable to you erica we are going to clear out the janitors closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you
would that be agreeable to you
im sorry erica but i spoke with wendyl this morning and shes not comfortable-
youll just have to share eric why cant you understand that
i thought you were a chick
stanley do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom
and so it is with great pride that i can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in
anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who dont care
hello mr garrison
congratulations on the polls we need to talk
there are people who know but they have to stay very hidden
mr garrison i wasnt fired i was replaced this goes much higher than anyone knows
if were going back remember we dont know who we can trust
we have to make sure nobody recognizes us theres no telling who works for who here caitlyn i got you this fake mustache to put on
keep your voice down
everythings changed
hes one of them
whose idea was it to revitalize the shitty part of town into an arts and foods district called shitpatown
it doesnt contain whats happened to south park is happening everywhere thirty miles south of here in the town of fairplay theyve changed the area north od downtown into nodofopa a rundown area south of the capital in cheyenne wyoming is now historic socacheywo channel street in mid-chicago is being revitalized into chimichanga
lodo sobro rivmo all happening at the same time and it isnt just in the us in cairo the area northwest of the third pyramid is nowe3pi three miles north of auschwitz is nomoauchie it goes on and on
take a look at this
it looks like he was researching this you see this news story
weve got everything from pc principals hard drive he was on to the gentrification around the world and he was convinced that whatever was responsible wasnt human
the news stories pc principal researched are all so contradictory as if whatever these things are have control over the news somehow
we have to find out who had me fired with the cosby joke its the key to knowing what were dealing with
how will we get him to talk
you got me fired why
if you had problems with me why didnt you just talk to me
