alright rebecca good job honey
come children lets take our trophies home and place them high up on the mantel
yes mark
well because son public schools are inefficient and dangerous
mark public schools are no good your mother and i were both home-schooled and we turned out much better because of it
alright fine mark you go ahead and go to public school you can just find out for yourself how flawed and treacherous it is
you dont want to go to public school too do you rebecca
well thank god for that at least my daughter will remain safe
who was that
oh no i told you the spelling bee was a bad idea
yes but now i think we may have opened a pandoras box that we cant close
oh where could he be he shouldve been home from public school by now
that must be him
oh my god son
mark what have they done to you
well you see this is what happens at public schools
well if were goin to let him go back it looks like i need to have a little talk with those other boys fathers
good evening gentlemen if i can have your attention for a few moments my son mark was beat up in school today by your sons i think it would be appropriate for you to talk with your sons and instruct them to no longer tease or bother my boy
cotswolds
well obviously they need to be coached a little better and furthermore your son has been harassing my little girl i would like you to tell him to stop
uh hello-o my girl is eight years old what does she need to know about love
i will not tell you how to raise your children and you will not tell me how to raise mine
no i dont drink beer i just like wine coolers
im sorry son theres nothing we can do to stop those bullies we have to pull you out of public school
well alright you can go but ill be there to supervise
mark wheres your sister
oh alright
rebecca dont play that perverted game
ah alright rebecca but its time to start your home-schooling
theyve got to be here somewhere
