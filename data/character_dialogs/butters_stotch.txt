im a dork and i deserve whats coming to me ow
fellas my underwear is so far up my buttcrack my legs are numb
uyeah i guess i deserve it
uugh
so what so im almost nine years old and anyone who hasnt kissed a girl by fourth grade is a dork
sellin kisses
you mean im gonna kiss a girl today
oh boy i sure am nervous
uh how come
i gotta do this i gotta know what it feels like
oh boy oh jeez oh stay calm butters eh how was it
im going ohh oh hi
so ummm yeah ah i was hopin maybe i could get a kiss
yeah cool uhhhm umuh okay
oh money rrright there you go a five dollar bill all for you
thank you
boy oh boy i finally did it im a man now jeez im gonna start havin lots of responsibilities soon i gotta start thinkin about a career theres gonna be family and bills to start worrying about m-no more play time for you butters you gotta buckle down and find and find yourself a way to make money hey i know
hey fellers fellers do you like gettin kisses cause i know a girl thatll give you a great kiss for just five dollars
sure scott even if you got diabetes
boy oh boy this sure is great ive been thinkin sally i could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too we could make double the money
aww nuts well i did have another idea what if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes
well you know we bring someone on show her what to do and then share all our money together
we could have our very own kissin company
the next key to a successful business is "innovation" i think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply cant afford the five dollars for a kiss so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug
why thanks sally i think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect megan im thinkin about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice
i got a kissing booth set up at the kids fair on saturday so kayla and ashley you take turns there any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets a little sunshine but if you dont show up for work at all im afraid you get a stormy cloud
hey fellas would anyone like a coupon were offerin two for one kisses today through thursday
yep i am founder and head ceo of the butters kissing company just look at this
im tellin ya guys this is the most genius idea ive ever come up with a lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees
a pimp huh
bohy kyle was right sally theres guys with kissing companies all over the country "the person managing all the women is known as the pimp while the working women are referred to as ho or bitch" oh youre a bitch sally
hey look at this theres about to be a big pimp convention it looks like i gotta get to that convention sally i could learn all kinds of stuff for our company
hi there my name is butters this sure is a nice convention huh yeah im just starting out i really came last minute cause i was hoping to learn more about being a successful pimp
yeah just about a week now i have four girls at the moment but i feel like i could be doing a better job
whats the game
yes i- i know what you are saying you dont have to keep asking
i know what youre saying
yeah i believe i know what you are saying
hey dad
aw hell dad i got lots of girlfriends sallys just my bottom bitch do you know what i am saying
boy oh boy really great work bitches you all sold lots of kisses today except for you megan im afraid you get a stormy cloud sticker today
i just hold on to all the money cause bitches cant be trusted with it we pool all the kissing money together see but if you wanna buy anything you just talk to the bottom bitch and then the bottom bitch talks to me alright see you after school do you know what i am saying
yo bebe bebe yo

clyde heres a hundred bucks if stan comes near me punch him
come on wendy you should be puttin that mouth to work
all these bitches are kissin fellers and they havent figured out that they can be making some serious fuckin money
really glad you joined the company annie now remember youre chargin five dollars for a kiss two for a hug and six for half and half alright bitch alright how about a freebie ohwoah whoopie
sure kyle
kyle every boy pays for kisses do you know what i am saying if youve got a girl and she kisses you sooner or later youre paying for it youve gotta take her out to lunch take her to a movie and then spend time listenin to all her stupid problems look look at stan right there hes gotta sit there and listen to her stupid motherfuckin problems cause she kisses him if you ask me thats a lot more than the five dollars my company charges
what happened is that i became a man im sorry im not your little buddy anymore but theres a time people have to grow up do you know what i am saying
and thats three thousand dollars today for charise
really great work bitch that is another sunshine sticker for you
mmmwhoa boy
and so i would like to see if there are any housing loan opportunities for some of my employees and also what kind of corporate tax i should be filing under
its a kissing company
oh sure my black employee charise over there one time she made two thousand dollars on one customer can you believe it two thousand dollars just to kiss a feller she currently stays in a motel room cause a lot of her customers see her late you wouldnt believe the time of night some fellers wanna kiss
course my bottom bitch keeps a database of all our customers specially the vips like senator morris
sure senator morris gets kisses every day at lunchtime you know where he likes to get kissed
in a motel room darnedest thing he must get sleepy
huh why
but i heard acorn helps pimps and their bitches

hey whoa well i cant believe what im hearing weve been practicing and gettin ready for this game and you fellas just wanna quit
this great game isnt about plays its about sportsmanship and compassion and when i look around this locker room well i see some of the nicest most compassionate guys ive ever met well tolkien youre nicer than anybody i know and clyde well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field
are we just gonna let north park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us bein nice is about whats inside you when your enemy is nice to you you just be nice right back and if they give you two balloons well you give them three
and when they try an-and thank you for those balloons you say "ah i dont need any thanks i did it cause it was the right thing to do" and then you give them a smile
and when that other team tries to cover you well thats when you gotta reach deep down right down to your creamy center well that place well that place inside of you where where all the gooey happy-lovin goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest most compassionate player youve ever been and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy
huh

well ih-its just that they have a lot of girls boobs and vaginas and stuff but most times they show a mans wiener its because that guys in a love scene with another guy do you think its because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers

what are we gonna do about them
hes not gonna stop hes loving all this he wants the girls to hurt us
its him or us
its not the police we have to worry about its eric hes gonna get us
it doesnt matter hes comin hes comin to get us
eeeaaaahhhh
its been a rough few weeks baby the girls are still mad about being trolled on the school message board parents are all freaking out about the election and and i tell you you are glad to not be living in this country right now
but baby i love you i need you you cant break up with me
oh my god i cant believe they got to you those sneaky snakes in the grass
well you know who the girls in my school they all broke up with their boyfriends and now they got you to go along with them
so then its true youre all snakes in the grass every last one of you
oh charlotte are you there honey
well why dont you just shut the fuck up kyle all ive been hearing in a few weeks is how this is our fault how boys need to change well im getting pretty sick of it everyone else seems to be proud about who they are but not us and then we get uncle kyle here telling us that the girls are right
this is a war on all of us you want to listen to uncle kyle well go ahead pretty soon theyll be locking us all up and dont think youre safe either tweek and craig just cause youre gay does not mean that you arent looked down upon for being boys the world wants us all to feel shame just because we were all born with wieners
no we tried doing it your way kyle we tried doing what the girls wanted us to do and where did it get us
right it turned us against one of our own match thats what it did what happened to eric cartman is the girls fault not ours
im done feeling guilt im a boy dang nab it and you know what im proud of my little wiener mark my words the moment is coming when you all need to decide are you with your kind or are you with uncle kyle

we walk together in peace we walk together in peace were not poor for feeling ashamed in who we are were not gonna feel guilt for the way we were born wieners out
dont let anyone tell you you are somehow nice because youre a boy dont let anyone tell you to not think with your wiener as if your wiener is a bad thing
what makes us different makes us beautiful no more shame no more doubt no more bigotry
dont be an uncle kyle be proud of who you are
you are either with us or against us its really that simple
good for you uncle kyle

okay mom ohhh dad are you wearin green or are you gonna get a pinch
okay well someones gettin a pinch today
hey clyde you got your green on hey jimmy nice green pants tee-hee te hee hee hee happy st patricks day fellas
you guys all look very festive
oh i hope they put green food coloring in our milk at lunchtime again like last year uh-oh hey kelly-ann whats going on
looks like someone forgot what day it was ha ha pi-i-i-i-nch
im sorry im sorry i didnt mean to do anything wrong honest
im so sorry please its just well she had it comin on account of the way she was dressed
oh jeez i didnt know kelly-ann was a minor well she didnt have a mining helmet or a pick axe or anything
but but sir its st patricks day
yes right
yes
ugh okay oh god
wul its just i mean what youre wearing you know its st patricks day youre not wearing any you dont have any green socks on do you
ohhhhh god i wanna pinch you so bad
no maam could you maybe put on some green lipstick or something
well technically yes i mean st patricks day is a wonderful day where we remember a british roman man who went to ireland and converted the whole country to christianity and he used a clover to represent the holy trinity so were supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you dont wear green you get a pinch
see thats the problem nobody knows how great he really was
oh god
i didnt finger nothin i swear it was just a tiny little st patricks day pinch it was it was like this ohhhg oh
ohhgu
dear st patrick if youre really up there ive always done my best to honor you on this most holy day you went to ireland and you got all those pagan worshippers to follow christ if theres any way that you could help me now just like send me a leprechaun or something i will be forever your dark servant amen
whoa
wow wee are you a real leprechaun
alright are we gonna bust outta here or what
st patrick was not irish he was a roman british man who was made a slave by irish barbarians but st patrick heard the voice of god and he used his situation for good and god told him to be brave and that is why on this one day of the year we must be like st patrick ourselves the police dont even care about st patricks day do you see any of them wearing green no if we do st patricks bidding he will provide for us
pi-i-i-i-nch
whu oh hey fellas
pretty good
what are you gonna do
i knew st patrick would perform a miracle to get us out of here just like when he was a slave he will help us go free
it is not over what did st patrick say when he was taken from his homeland and turned into a slave st patrick didnt give up and when the christians slandered him while he was trying to convert the heathen irish did he give up then
yeah
you see the power of st patrick compels you
yes now use your clover rays
uh oh
wahggh
ahghggh
its him its st patrick
once again i shoulda never listened to what they told me in church
