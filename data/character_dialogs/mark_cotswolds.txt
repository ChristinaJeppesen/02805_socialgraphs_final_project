it was nice competing against you boys we will have to do it again sometime
no i live right over there ive lived there all my life
because im home-schooled
my parent teach me so i stay at home instead of going to school
right
oh my goodness are you two enemies
strange friends would call each other names and fight
papa
why cant i go to school with the other boys
but i want to play with the other children o how they laugh and play papá
i just feel like i should go to public school if only for a little while to see what other little boys are like
please papá just let me try it for a few days
hooray
hey guys whats up
the answer is 1492 however the americas had already been discovered by many before him including the vikings and the native americans and therefore your question is a charade
i dont understand you seem to like that boy yet hate him at the same time
oh i promised my father i wouldnt
you mean you would actually duct-tape my entire body to a bench for what purpose
oh dear
hi mom hi dad
well they duct-taped me to a bench
i dont know mother it didnt make any sense at all
but i want to go back tomorrow papá
please just give me one more day
can i sit here with you
why do you call kyle names and laugh at him is he not your friend
i see its like you have to mark your territory as a boy you have to socially find your place
ah stick and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me
huh
oh papá can i at least go to the dance tomorrow
alright
shes upstairs playing doctor with that kyle boy
rebecca what the devil are you doing
youre out of control you did this to my sister
you made my sister into a slut ill kill you
you dip im gonna whip your bitch ass
im not through with you bitch
calm down papá everything is all right you see ive learned something today public schools may be a bit lacking in education but its the main place where children learn all of their social skills you cant teach a child social skills they have to learn them themselves and the only place to do that is on the playground in the cafeteria and so on dont you see papá thats what happened to your daughter you tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual and now look at her shes a god-damned whore papá
i know letting your kids out into the world is scary i know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us but bad things will happen and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things
thanks gaywad
see ya papá
