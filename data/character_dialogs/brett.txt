hey youre the kid i sold the guitar hero game to how are you likin it
yeah guitar hero can be pretty stressful but you know maybe instead of a game guide you should just buy another game to kind of ease the stress
have you ever heard of heroin hero
its a way easier game all you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin you could call it the ultimate first-person shooter
no man all you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon but you dont ever catch the dragon you just keep chasing it
there he is so did you break a million yet
aw come on once you start playing guitar hero you cant stop till you reach the top
have you played rehab hero you get chased by a big dragon but you keep running away from it
sssure kid sure
