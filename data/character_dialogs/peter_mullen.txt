this is my frog he doesnt have a name hes a frog not a toad because toads dont ribbit i think frogs are good pets
my report is on the vile and despicable trash that our parents are watching on television fellow students there is a plague of smut on our cable boxes shows that feature reenactments of unsolved crimes and spousal homicide im talking of course about murder porn
according to the nielsen ratings viewership in shows like "cold case files" "dateline murder" and "deadly affairs" is skyrocketing amongst married couples the increased viewership has brought about a whole new slew of shows that use graphic sex and innuendo to make spousal murder more titillating shows like "southern fried homicide" "sinful secrets" "on the case with paula zahn" and its all smut and its garbage and its trash your parents are watching this stuff go home and ask them and as we ask them we must also ask ourselves "if theyre obsessed with this stuff then how long how long before one of our daddies dresses up in lingerie and bashes mommys head in with a brick"
