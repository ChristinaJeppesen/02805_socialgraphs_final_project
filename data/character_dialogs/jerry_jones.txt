were here to help however we can your special ed department has all our resources and all our support this science fair just might be what saves us all
good bring it on in these kids need to have access to everything they need
thats correct like you weve come to realize that water bears are the key to our future are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board
then they are the key to our survival boys
theres no time for that we need everyone working on jimmy and timmys project im gonna let you kids all in on a little secret we dont wanna create a panic but the end is very near and we have very little time
the government wuh we arent the government
not you us were with the nfl our fans are leaving at an exponential rate weve been hit with anthem protests protests of those protests and worst of all concussions the more reports that come out the more people are getting turned off by football weve been experimenting with water bears because we believe they are our last hope
