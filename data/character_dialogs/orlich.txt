the police have us completely surrounded on all sides theres no way were gettin out above ground without being spotted
look i found this at the rear of the park its an old mine shaft but pioneer village was sued when a kid died in it so they closed it down and protected it with a huge meal door with a coded lock
one more thing franz i want my share of the take now
i was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel then you take the loot to berlin and i never see you again i want my cut
