hello sheila its sharon stans mother
sheila i was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick
so this is your fault
would you do me a favor next time you want to scare the hell out of my child just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead
oh hello ms cartman its sharon stans mother
ms cartman is your son at home
well now i am worried ive tried all the houses and nobody knows where they are
what do ya mean how often does an entire third-grade class go missing

but whats wrong with her
no no shes been perfectly healthy
shelly look whos come to visit you your little brother stan
will my daughter be okay
come on stanley give your sister a kiss and then we have to go
and then the doctor said that its much worse as you get older my daughter is in pretty bad shape now but if she were in her twenties she could die
so tell me if im crazy but i started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox let them get it now while theyre young

im watching one of stanleys chinpokomon video tapes
our son loves this show randy so i think its important that we watch it to see if its teaching him good moral values
i dont know what the hell theyre talking about
this doesnt make sense are those stupid things supposed to be animals or robots or what
randy we cant allow our son to watch this stuff
no but its incredibly stupid and that could be worse on a childs mind than any vulgarity or violence remember what battle of the network stars did to an entire generation
we just thought wed bring it to everyones attention because honestly we dont know how to feel
youre right sheila i guess the best thing we can do is just let them go until they get sick of it
my son hasnt made any sense in days
so what are we going to do about our children ahhh hello-o
of course thats a great idea
stan
stan its mommy
stanley--

what the hell are you doing
bullshit
youre doing this to try and get to the front of the line on black friday arent you

randy whose are these
why because theres fishnet stockings inside your jeans
randy do you have something to tell me
randy
i was can you help me unload the car
randy
you just gonna drink beer alone all day
all right do you know why young people like lorde so much its because shes something different kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it lorde represents something in all of us the truth that wants to be heard if i could talk to lorde right now you know what id tell her id tell her not to let people change who she is id tell her that if people are making fun of her its probably because they lost touch with being human id tell her to keep on doing what she does because when someones not allowed to express who they are inside then we all lose thats what i would say to lorde
oh no i cant watch
youre supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood
wull whattaya mean
well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking
stan where are you going
randy
randy what are you doing

i guess something happened at school today involving two of stans friends being gay
yeah stan seems really perplexed
go talk to him randy and be delicate
hes playing ninjas over at kennys house
yeah
uh huh
randy what are you doing
do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is
your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice its just a way to pick up on young women
i dont want you going over there anymore
is it all i know is that youve changed every since you joined this pc thing you just bully people and wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used
what
whats going on randy
last month all you could talk about was how great this town had become what changed your mind
we cant afford it
well well just have to stop going to those places
you what
can you pass the garlic bread randy
i thought you just said you were full
you pulled a gun on our son randy
i told you to leave him alone

someone purposely had principal victoria replaced with a new principal
randy
randy youre yelling at a whole foods
whyd you say id be voting for the turd sandwich randy you havent even talked to me about it
go to hell randy
randy you just spent the last month convincing me that the only reason people wanted to go back was because of a childish nostalgia they all had for the new star wars
what i dont wanna watch star wars any more than i-
randy do you mind cleaning out the garage like i asked
ach
your columbus shot glasses and coffee cups are in that cupboard
i dont know where you put them randy
you were stoked on columbus randy not me
i actually was a little upset that you dressed up as columbus for our wedding but i decided-
i have not
randy why dont you just admit to people that maybe you were somewhat overly excited about columbus in the past
what
im doing something
oh no youre not doing this again
stan wanted us to take him to the pumpkin patch
yeah and you guys get wasted
did you hear anything about what happened last night

randy what did you guys do at that party
people were hurt
where do you think youre going
you cant possibly be considering doing this again
randy a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children i dont think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying

dont you dare suggest that im only emotional because its-
get out randy im not overreacting
thanks for coming everybody im sure you all heard there was yet another school shooting today we have to figure out what were going to do as parents because this whole thing is out of control we have to ask ourselves why this is happening and do something now
what are you talking about do you understand that our children are being murdered
how much closer to home can this all hit it was at our childrens school
are you fucking joking youre gonna take one second to compare child murder to park upgrades what is wrong with everybody youve all gone crazy
randy they announced on the news theres been another school shooting in jefferson county
what is "cool" about that
god
i keep thinking when will be the time when i get the call you know when will i answer the phone and find out my son my daughter were killed at school

randy we need to talk
theres been too much pain and suffering and it has to stop
