i know that song is so awesome
you think hes gonna beg her to come back to him
deliberating "which girl has the cutest purse" millie has the floor
sunshine sparkle wendy has the floor
why would she do that
did you know wendy that clydes father owns the shoe store at the mall a lot of us have always wanted to date clyde to get free shoes but we couldnt because he wasnt popular enough
unfortunately the members voted clyde in the bottom five of the list thats why we had to manipulate the votes forge a new list and hide the real one
do yourself a favor wendy just let it go and keep your little mouth shut
