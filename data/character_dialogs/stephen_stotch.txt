your friends wanted to see you butters
oh well uh thats okay butters remember what we talked about sometimes our happy creamy filling just gets soo full it comes out at night
all right butters lets its happy feelings lets just not talk about it
and you can just sit here in your room and think about what youve done just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesnt mean you need to take it to "oh why dont we just drink each others cum" sarcasm like that is homophobic chauvinistic and completely lacking in maturity any questions
well talk about that when youre older
what
oh well butters thats just the friendly compass see whenever you have friends in the area your little compass there tells you where they are its pointing up because jesus is your friend
how do you know shes not i mean think about it this is a guy who visits all our houses during the day who clearly has a kind of insatiable lust i mean somebody who would have sex with kyles mom would have sex with just about anything
damn you its not just our wives anymore this morning he came for me i opened the door it was the ups man he had a box from amazon i looked inside and found an adapter for an iphone and then i remembered i had ordered it i ordered it the day before and i had barely any recollection the ups man is using his powers to try to have sex with me now
i know that what i feel for you is just some kind of spell
just let me sign all right hes coming to you
you should have never come to our town
what
how
son of a bitch its him all right
hes stopping at another house

butters what on earth has gotten into you
do you have any idea how grounded you are about to be mister
yes our little butters is flowering he has reached the age of panua
principal victoria this isnt butters fault
it has to do with biology youve maybe noticed that butters isnt exactly like other kids
you probably think butters seems somehow different
its because he is his mother and i his whole family were were not of this place
please just try to understand that for our people its a very private matter he cant be helped by your discipline this must be dealt with by his own kind if its all right with you wed like an extended leave for our boy please its a cultural thing
its our peoples way linda you know that better than i do
you know thats not allowed
butters youve reached the age where you must journey to your birthplace for the ceremony of hapa noa
no we moved here just before you started pre-school you were born in our native land butters a distant and very secluded island world called havai
only haoles pronounce it hawaii butters but those of us from havai are a very special people we have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive we drink chi-chis from the coconut we eat poke that the safeway provides and when weve chosen a mate we marry at the fern grotto as your mother and i did so very long ago as a stotch butters you are actually hawaiian royalty your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the king
not an emo chick on her period butters like a salmon needing to swim back upriver all hawaiians feel it it is called "hapahui apahoha" and it means its now your time to make your trip to our island home you must do your walkabout to your homeland butters and you must do it alone take this son it is our mahalo rewards card it will provide you with all you need and now i must turn my back on you
who do out children think they are blocking our tv content

oh nonono we took a handicar it was easier that way

yeah and its cheaper than a taxi im telling you its the future of transportation oh here it comes honey our handicar is here
have fun drivin home ill be relaxing on my ipad
download the app it works great
timmy oh hi gerald sheila
you didnt know anyone can be a handicar driver now all you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a handicap ive had my handicap for about three days now get on in im telling you gerald havin a handicar is a great way to make some money on the side
timmy
the world of transportation is really changing gerald
dont you see what theyre doing this is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps
look the point is that this is your opportunity to make handicar- oops sorry hold on sorry went too far this is your opportunity to make handicar thee transportation of thte future think what you could do with all that money
butters
butters are you home
what are you talkin about
hey now hold on i am a drone hobby enthusiast i would never use my drone in a way that contradicts the drone hobbyist code of conduct
i assure you my drone is sitting in the garage ill show you
there you see its right there
i swear i didnt fly it
butters
butters did you hear the drone making any sounds in the garage
nothing son its nothing get back to sleep pal love you
yes id like to return this drone
yes im im not into the hobby anymore
look somethings wrong with it it does things it flies by itself
you dont understand it was in the garage and the battery was fully charged someone said theyd seen it flying around so i checked the battery was half empty
please i just want another hobby to get enthused about
you think i didnt try that i pulled out the sd card it was all erased somehow it erased everything
no its impossible hes not allowed to fly it without my supervision
randy we need to talk
inside ive been going over it and over it in my head i thought butters and i were alone but then i saw you on the news another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didnt recall doing randy this is very important is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts
i thought it was just my drone but i think it might be all of them
once you eliminate the impossible whatever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth our drone flew the battery was drained the sd card was erased butters was the only other person who had access to it butters cant use the drone without my supervision so where does that leave us randy
if they have minds of their own theyre more than spooky i dont know about you but im starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby
please do not adjust your televisions
my name is stephen willis stotch the drone that took the video of craigs mom was my drone i didnt want to believe it but they do things without us knowing at this point i have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby all of you with drones please listen to me three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the internet we all were told to respectfully not watch the video but on the page it has over three hundred million views so if none of us watched it who did we have to find a way to get rid of them before they get rid of us
time to end this hobby once and for all no noooo
were here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "no more" just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones she did something miraculous and someday our childrens children will still be telling stories about how craig mom flew through the town and led all the drones away
there you are mister just what do you think youre doing
i know that what do you-
ohhh oooooo ohhh
what kind of person did we raise you to be you think this world is just there for your amusement you are not to leave this room and you are not allowed to use the phone or the computer
oh no mister you are grounded
butters who is that
well this looks like a lovely meal too bad butters wont be enjoying it you hear that mister no dinner for you while youre grounded you can just go to bed hungry linda do you remember why butters is grounded what what did he do

thomas im so glad that craig is finally happy hey its craigs dad everybody
its isis
theyre these troubled kids whove turned their backs on america theyve taken over sodosopa forced all the homeless out
theyre just bad kids rotten on the inside probably with shitty parents
im pretty sure the police will help out if its because isis is taking over the town
officers theres kids in town who have joined isis we dont know who they are but they-
that is not true who said that look barbrady the fact is the town needs you
wow wow this is so great have you ever read the elementary school newspaper linda theres no ads no sponsored content no links to click on just news stories about whats happening did you know that the police in shitpatown beat up homeless to clear them out do you know long its been since i was able to just sit back and read the news i got so used to getting news off the internet but i feel like im always trying to chase the news somehow its like im in a black void trying to reach the news story but then the next thing i know im reading an ad for geico so i click out of that and try to read the news story but its not a news story its a slide show and im looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever so of course i want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong so i hit the arrow but then the arrow wasnt the arrow for the next line it was to take me to an ad for face cream haugh i wanted to get a news story but im reading about face cream and i try to click out of it but the ad is following me and its following me all over the screen nooo so i click on the close button but it wasnt a close button it was another slide show and i just want to know whats happening in the middle east but instead im looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time and thats not the arrow for the next line its another ad aaagh but this this is just news and i dont get lost in all the bullshit linda linda
i had to get away from the ads i felt like the ads were evolving somehow they started knowing what i liked what i was afraid of i tried ad blockers but it seemed like every time i tried to block the ads they just got smarter im never going back from super school news
i will
maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more care about each other
oh my god that was great
randy you gotta calm down
look maybe you need some supplements to help calm your nerves have you heard of member berries
its a new superfruit that helps you mellow out and relax
the guys at work told me about them been taking them about six months now ill telling you they really take the edge off
\tsome are a lot of people like what he has to say alright
more than ever
dont you get it randy theres people in this country who are sick and tired tired of hearing all the rhetoric tired of washington failing us while they pat their own backs finally someone comes along and says what he feels thats why people like him you can say what you want at least he doesnt sound like another politician
what
are you out of your fuckin mind
you wanna vote for that douche hell ruin this country
yeah but not anymore
i dont know
you just did
i dont know nobody knows what to think anymore
im just tired of thinkin about it come on lets relax and have some member berry pie

the president he wont listen to us he hates us now
butters youre not looking at boobies again are you
you know what i think the problem is facebook
well look we all know theres a lot of mixing of truth and fiction thats been on facebook lately and children lack the cognitive ability to determine whats true and what isnt on facebook thats why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes eating poop and having sex with antelopes in our town
why not give it a try lets invite mark zuckerberg here and see what he has to say im sure hes a reasonable person
what eh excuse me this is our car
get get out of here ya penis
you have to do something this guys goin around acting like everyones stuff is his
please you dont understand he-h hes such a penis
butters youre the one who started all this
you think youre just so smart dont you make me look like a fool will you well just see about this
not so funny now is it go on tell mr putin what you told me
didnt break any rules good job teaching our children thats all that matters just because theres a way to cause chaos in a town or disrupt an entire country doesnt mean you go and do it does it if mark zuckerberg points a loaded cannon at someones face are you innocent for just lighting the fuse answer me
no you dont go around making things up about people either unless its about mark zuckerberg because he deserves it i hope youre both very satisfied with the damage youve caused because youre both grounded
