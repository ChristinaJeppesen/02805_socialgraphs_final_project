bebe is something the matter
oh sweetie youre all just growing up part of being a woman is having a friend one day and calling her a slut the next
i remember when i was a little girl the boys didnt think i was very smart at all but then one day they all started thinking i was really smart i guess big smarts just run in our family
oh hello boys
no shes with one of her little friends but she should be back shortly if you boys wanna wait
i believe she is playing "lambs" over at eric cartmans house
bebe those boys from your school are still waiting outside to see if youll come out
looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers
sweetie youre just blossoming into a woman
sweetie youre a stevens and stevens women are always told theyre really really smart
oho sweetie those are two completely different numbers alright boys time to be getting home bebes not feeling well and she cant come out today go on shoo
what is it bebe
oh sweetheart youre just becoming a young lady
yes darling your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older they feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can youre blossoming into a woman
i think its empowering for them i mean sure if a man wants to be a whore its normal but if a woman wants to be one its wrong
how does the school let things like this happen
