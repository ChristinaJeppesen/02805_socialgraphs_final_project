hey jimmy im doctor pal thats because im a doctor but im also your pal are we cool
a lot of times parents call me in because i can relate to younger kids im im down im dope you dig now i understand you have some concerns about erections "oops cant say erection in front of the parents right oh god i feel so weird" huh
jimmy theres nothing weird about random erections almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard for no particular reason its just part of growing up growing up growing out is more like it
tell you what mom and dad why dont you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo
jimmy as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken and so if you like we can take off our shirts and kiss
oh hey nothin you see see that set you off on a different tangent got you thinkin a different way thats what doctor pal is here to do unless of course you think we should take off our shirts and kiss
well then to hell with you kid you can just deal with your problems on your own
