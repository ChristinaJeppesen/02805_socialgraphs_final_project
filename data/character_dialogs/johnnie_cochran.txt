ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury chefs attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote "stinky britches" ten years ago and they make a good case hell i almost felt pity myself but ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury i have one final thing i want you to consider
ladies and gentleman this is chewbacca chewbacca is a wookie from the planet kashyyyk but chewbacca lives on the planet endor now think about that that does not make sense
why would a wookiee an 8-foot-tall wookiee want to live on endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall ewoks that does not make sense but more important you have to ask yourself "what does this have to do with this case" nothing
ladies and gentlemen it has nothing to do with this case it does not make sense look at me im a lawyer defending a major record company and im talkin about chewbacca does that make sense ladies and gentlemen i am not making any sense none of this makes sense and so you have to remember when youre in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the emancipation proclamation does it make sense no ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury it does not make sense if chewbacca lives on endor you must acquit the defense rests
wait mr chef this music has really touched me i like to take up your case free of charge
i will
well see you in court mr record producer
ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client chef i know he seems guilty but ladies and gentlemen this
is chewbacca now think about that for one minute that does not make sense why am i talkin about chewbacca when a mans life is on the line why i tell you why i dont know it doesnt make sense if chewbacca does not make sense you must acquit
here look at the monkey look at the silly monkey
