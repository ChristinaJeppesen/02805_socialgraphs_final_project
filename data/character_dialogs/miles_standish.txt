how now indian why hast thy race sent me here to earth
you indians took me to thy planet and then cast me here why
hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die tell me indian
hold your lying tongue this shall prove if thou art indian or not ah he was not
i have been told of your expertise kyle of devry institute i need your wisdom to get back to my planet
into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me we must make haste to cape cod
this is natalie
we shall make camp here for the night on the morrow perhaps we can reach cape cod and thanksgiving may yet be saved what is wrong with kyle of devry institute
he seems almost like a puritan lady whose period hath stopped i fear kyle that you still do not know whose side to be on
it must have been very difficult for you being the one on your planet with his wild theories that pilgrims and indians were not of this world
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha then you are only just a remarkably gifted child here let me show you your planet is one of the five plymouth indi colthenheim and this planet over here nobody really cares about the five are connected by a series of wormholes my people came to your world and so did our enemies but we made a treaty and for 300 years our people have not fought but now the treaty is over
you cant believe what everyone tells you kyle you have to open your eyes soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to plymouth and the stuffing mines can again be ours for he who controls the stuffing controls the universe
stay back all of you for i will get to cape cod and cannot be stopped come boys let us fight to the death
i trust none but them indians hath betrayed us i must return to plymouth so my king can know the truth
then get us to cape cod as soon as possible
earth is connected to plymouth by this wormhole here once i get back i will assemble my people to attack indi and gain control of the stuffing mines if all goes as planned you will all have stuffing in time for thanksgiving
ah ha ha ha of course not you have the correct symbol but you are missing the keeper of the portal
please kyle of devry institute there is no more time for squabbles the universe is at stake
yes
thank you kyle of devry institute now the indians can be stopped and thanksgiving will be saved
now make way children for i have a war to fight for stuffing
now attack their left flank good theyre retreating hit them with the anti-indian device
