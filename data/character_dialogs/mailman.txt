weve all heard of rudolph and his shiny noseand we all know frosty whos made out of snowbut all of those stories seem kind of gaycuz we all know who brightens up our holiday
small and brown he comes from you
squeeze in tween your festive buns a present from down below spreading joy with a
mailman and kids
hes seen the love inside of you cause
mailman and kids
sometimes hes nutty sometimes hes corny he can be brown or greenish brown
but if you eat fiber on christmas evehe might come to your town
he loves me i love youtherefore vicariously he loves you
when christmas leaves he must leave too
