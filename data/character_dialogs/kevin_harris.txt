well come on in how about a little history first native americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant they smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes
excuse me
the first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in virginia in 1612 within seven years it was one of the countrys largest exports
thats right over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from africa to help work the fields
and so for centuries tobacco production flourished nobody was even aware of any dangers back then until in 1965 when congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the surgeon generals warning on their packages so now everyone knows the dangers of smoking and some people still choose to do it and we believe thats what being an american is all about
and heres our factory at work
well i guess thats the end of our tour
what
oh my god
we will not
