hey guys– i just wanna say im really proud to be a part of this office wearing our pajamas shows that we care about those school kids– that we care about other people south park realtors
whats going on mike
youre not wearing pajamas
were all wearing pajamas
we arent telling you to wear pajamas– he walks over and opens the door] but im pretty sure this sign right here on the door says you have to wear pajamas
its opposite day well shit we gotta go put some normal clothes on
because we are people who believe very strongly in wearing pajamas to the workplace if were wearing pajamas on opposite day that means we dont normally wear pajamas and were douchebags like mike
