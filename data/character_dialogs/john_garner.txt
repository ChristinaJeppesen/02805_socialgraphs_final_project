hello everyone my name is john garner and im a nutrition advisor from the usda i want to clarify the usdas position on a healthy diet theres been a lot of confusion about gluten lately people saying that gluten is the cause of cancer gluten should be avoided gluten can make your dick fly off but lets set the record straight
people believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier but of course thats a bunch of hooey hooey is the preservative found in processed foods that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity you might say "well theres fat in butter too" but thats just poppycock poppycock first came from india and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey the good hooey not the bad hooey so what is gluten
simply put gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away flour is of course just wheat and when you add a liquid to flour you get dough dough that makes breads doughnuts pasta and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy now if we wash the dough of all its starch we can actually distil the wheat down minus the water minus the starch and what were left with is pure gluten not a bio-weapon just harmless flour protein
excuse me
yeah alright dup dup
