hello aunt sheila
oh it was terrible they recycled the air on board and it really did a number on my asthma i-i-e-i asked them to turn up the oxygen and they wouldnt
hi uncle gerry
its nice to meet you
ah-a-a-alright im done
ye-yes i-ive tallied up all the times youve been naughty and deducted the times youve been nice
it doesnt look good eric it doesnt look good
a-a-aactually it looks like this year youre gonna owe santa three hundred and six presents
four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice is is bad
yes wa-a-i didnt think "hitting clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice
ye you cant deduct things like that eric santa will know and then hell come after you
hey hey im just your naughty-and-nice accountant dont blame me for the numbers
but what look arent there any other nice things youve done recently we can write off here
eh brushing your teeth isnt naughty or nice eric it just it falls more into the category of brushing your teeth
if you cured cancer and aids next week you would still owe two presents
ah im afraid youre gonna have to find a way to do the nicest greaatest thing anyone has ever done ever
im baaack
