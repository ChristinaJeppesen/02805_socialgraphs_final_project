uhh
you son of a bitch do you have any idea what youve done
come with me
there look
dont you get it when people drive hybrid cars they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air that isnt smog its smug
hybrid cars make better for emission levels but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug you can have smug in the atmosphere and you know what that leads to glodal laming thanks to your gay little song south park is now the second smuggiest city in america
marsh
youd better come with me to the news station our situation just got a lot worse
weve got to tell the townspeople south park still has a chance to make it through the storm
soo thats it people when the smug from george clooneys speech hits the san francisco and south park smug were gonna witness a storm the likes of which weve never seen
if the smug clouds remain the way they are yes
listen though we all agree this is stans fault there is still something we can do if we all work together to reduce smugness we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm at least here in our own town
how long do we have until the smug clouds collide
all right all right now get it into the masher hurry up
well then you shouldnt have written that gay little song shouldnt you have keenan weve gotten rid of half the hybrid cars how are the smug levels
keenan keenan weve smashed the last hybrid
