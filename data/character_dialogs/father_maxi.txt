mayor the nativity is what christmas is all about if you remove christ you must remove santa and frosty and all of that garbage too
this is the most god-awful piece of crap ive ever seen
yeah its because the jews said it couldnt be christian
oof
look its that guy from the public access show
when is satan gonna show up
youre gonna kick his ass jesus
uh-ssee ya - saturday - jesus good luck
you should all be ashamed of yourselves betting against your lord and savior i am disgusted

praise the lo-hohohord thank you sweet jesus for showing us the light see ya later
what the hell does he think were all crazy
i dont believe this
"yea usher us unto the lord" sayeth some jewish guy once ashes to ashes dust to dust
"yea let us ponder the lords mercy ashes to ashes dust to dust"
yeah and the food is terrible
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh there seems to be a lot more takething going on but there it is perhaps if more of you attended church on sundays the lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…
now let us pray lord though we have lost neil smith to free agency and steve atwater to the jets still we hope our beloved broncos can bring home another super bowl championship and once again bathe in the glory of your light amen
lets go-
broncos
let’s go broncos

huh
wonderful heres a book on how to perform it dont let me down boys

do you chef take this woman as your lawful-wedded wife to have and to-
and do you veronica take chef to be your daddy
and now a special sharing of vows through song
halloween is an abomination of god a celebration of the occult-eh
korn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music if we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays we may incur the full wrath of evil
i know who you are and what you stand for i think your music and halloween is an abomination
i warned you i told you this would happen when you allow bands like korn to come to town and play your hedonistic halloween concerts this is what you get
whoa
well what are you waiting for barbrady arrest that band
because halloween is an abomination of god i would do anything to stop this wretched unholy holiday
no
i tell you mayor these japanese are trying to change our american children somehow
were sorry we took your time gentlemen
nice guys
people people please youre forgetting that homosexuality is a choice as many of you know i myself went through a homosexual phase but the light of christ showed me how to change just give me two hours with this man and i can convert him back
eric god could sure use that money for a bigger church
friends we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterdays tragedy nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver
it is sometimes hard in times like these to understand gods way why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who perhaps shouldnt be driving it is then that we must understand gods sense of humor is very different from our own he does not laugh at the simple "man walks into a bar" joke no god needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me all that we can hope for is that god got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again
and so it was that god sent his only son down from heaven to die for our sins
what is troubling you my child
ah you mean hes a jew
yes the passion is very powerful the truth is theres not a whole lot in the bible about the crucifixion the passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the middle ages to incite people against the jews
well if you really care about your friends soul then perhaps show him the way of jesus remember christianity is about atonement
and he shall be remembered as the peaceful little boy who warmed his parents hearts lord as we commit this childs body to the earth may we ask itd be the last child you strike down so mercilessly we know this request to be futile lord but just though we would ask
i now pronounce you man and man
is that true son are you feeling confused
young man these confused feelings that youre having are simply the devils way of trying to get a hold of you
there is a special camp where young men who are confused like your son can go and be cleansed by the power of god many bi-curious boys come out the camp completely cured
not yet katie
thats it girls no more disney tv for a while
and so as we commit this young child to the earth let us all be reminded that syphilis is still a deadly disease and it can be caught even if using protection this young boy learned the hard way that theres no guarantee for the world of oral sex is a world
youve really done an amazing thing mr marsh people have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the economys mighty sword
spend more what mockery is this
are you retarded stotch the economy is omnipotent which means it can do anything so saying it would be limited to one son is fucking stupid
yep i think we gotta kill the jew
on this gorgeous day we bring these two together for the most important ta-
where could it even go
maybe they wont even answ-
randy stephen weve got a big problem the owner of city wok has child labor making videos for him
its all over the place hes tryin to revitalize his rundown neighborhood
lord we look to thee on this to our most trouble hour we have been let astray and now all we could do is wait for the inevitable to happen soon everything we have said and done online is going to be known to all many lives will be turned upside down of course i have nothing to worry about since im a priest theres nothing im ashamed of doing on the internet so definitely no reason to look up my history but uh for many this is a time to pray
for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that whoever believed in him should have eternal life this is the gospel of the lord
todays gospel talks about what the lord has to give us he did so because we could not control our temptations
uh okay okay lets lets try and have none of that today in john 316 the gospel tells us how god so loved the world he gave to us his only son
okay okay co-come on guys nu-now what greater gift could the lord has given to us
okay lets lets try to compose ourselves lets try and just get through this first one okay guys what does it mean that the lord gave us his only begotten son
oh of course my child whats troubling you
well we cant all walk away the-the priesthood is all i know i i dedicated my entire life to it ah i dont know anything else
uh hello my children
praise the lord for the lord is good sing praise to his name for that is pleasant
uh i shouldnt be here
i should go
this is just gonna make things way worse people will rip on me
i do
why do you care
i have to admit its a pretty nice way to spend a sunday how many are your works lord in wisdom you made them all
he is because he brought me you
for we are gods handiwork created in christ jesus to do good works
come on father lets go tear up the skating rink
uh-ah oh mother mary i feel like everyones staring at me
and now let us pray
bless us o lord and these thy gifts which we are about to receive
he caused the east wind to blow in the heavens
through christ our lord amen
all right my child
just leave me alone
look your friends are right okay i dont belong there i i dont belong anywhere
stop defending me there are things you dont know
yes it is it is my fault
because i knew all right i knew years ago when bad things started coming out about the catholic church i went to the vatican and i found out that the problem was worse than anyone even thought i thought i could help fix it so i kept my mouth shut i thought there was cancer in the church that we could get rid of but the church is cancer its not about a few bad apples there are only a few good apples and im clearly not one of them so just stay away from me
you thought wrong
hello mr marsh
m mr marsh-
-please
im just going around trying to locate little butters stotch i thought he might be here playing a board game with your son
im sorry but i have to keep looking i said some terrible things
what cleanup crew

oh my lord i know where to go and when we get there ill need to go in alone
wait

a transfer
i can just go i can start over in the maldives
yes i do i dont think i have any other choice
im so sorry my child i never meant to say we werent pals
of course now i have purpose and i have meaning my job here is to protect you all of you
the lord be with you
today id like to talk on the subject of penance the penitent have deep remorse but for true penance we must be humble enough to admit that the lords forgiveness is undeserved
in job 426 we read "therefore i reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes"
so we are not to punish ourselves but instead we are to make ourselves passionate
passionate to understand all that christ sacrificed and how hard it truly was
little jason white was a happy child a playful child and ultimately it was his playfulness in sports that got him killed in a freak hit-and-run accident the father would like to now say a few words
as a teacher mrs nelson did everything she could for her students so it seems even more unfair that she was just a few days late in getting the vaccine before she died of covid and now as mr garrison takes over teaching for mrs nelson permanently i think we should all take a moment to say hey the rest of us made it south park were on the other side of this damn thing and so its time for adults to screw these masks and party like its 2021
