my name is casey miller and im in the third grade ever since i can remember people have told me i should read their morning announcements my friends always said to me "dear casey your voice is like butter to our ears could you please find a way to get that audible chocolate on the airwaves" well here i am and hopefully ill be the kid with the job
im tryin out and dryin out in the sultry summer sun that is my voice
excuse me
i dont understand what i did wrong
hyeah
eric cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders we should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina im casey miller
it is time for that slutty smurf-killing bitch to get whats comin to er
the sun is up and the birds are chirping im casey miller and these are the morning announcements i have a letter from second-grade student brian falner brian writes "dear casey why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead my desk is broken and so far eric cartman has done nothing about it will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy" well brian i couldnt agree more our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake
