i know how you feel eric i know how hard it is when school gets out with no phone no human contact
come on there are others like us here
\ti want to tell you that im sorry
\twhen women first started getting trolled on the school message boards i was sure it was you i was wrong
so when you held the assembly that woman were just as funny as men you you werent being sarcastic
\tdo you miss your friends
you do now
hey
why is that
is that a joke
i dont get it
the hardest part is not having any followers i used to go places just to show them where i was
you dip your french fries in the sweet & sour sauce
wow thats really good im starting to feel like life isnt gonna be so bad
\tyeah of course
girls do not have balls no
do you want me to show you

yay put it on me
oh yeah hey kyle the shows on at five tonight if you want to watch it at your house or my house
why whats going on boo
shut up
i dont even try to be funny
what
babe stop i dont think he meant anything by it
look kyle i think its great youre trying to patch things up with everyone but the truth is eric and i are just kind of out of it now
we gave up social media and the ugliness that goes along with it and were in a better place
hey leave him alone eric tries to help and you call him names sorry babe i had to step in
whats up
eheh stop eric
thanks babe i dont know if you guys have heard but right now denmark is trying to make trolling a thing of the past theyre asking for help and i thought "why not a school fundraiser"
what how did i say it
when was this were we at dennys
oh and you kept spilling it and everything
he had that weird haircut and you kept saying that it looked like he had a dick on his head
then we should all come together as a skewl
hey guys today were gonna start our school fundraiser its an idea i came up with called "danishes for denmark"
we need everyone to do their part so later on in the cafeteria we are all gonna need to-
i really feel like this is the start of something new were gonna help denmark and denmark is gonna put an end to trolls
hello buy a danish to help stop trolling how come nobodys stopping maybe this was a terrible idea
then all of this was for nothing
oh no this was a terrible idea
im so stupid
why did i even think i could bring the boys and girls together again
\tstop baby no im not
i have an idea i might be able to figure out the source of who trolled you last night
what are you thinking about babe
youre worried about him again arent you your friend kyle
then talk to him babe tell him what were doing maybe you can get him back
eric really cares about you kyle he feels like hes losing you and hes really upset
this is gonna seem a little weird to you okay
before i quit twitter and threw my phone away i was trying to prove who our school message board troll was
before i stopped searching i learned something take a look
to try and prove who the troll was i started to for patterns in how students used emojis then i crossed-referenced that with the trolls writing i call it "emoji analysis" people can hide behind a fake name but the way they use emojis gives them away
after i had eliminated nearly every student i have started to realize that the trolls emojis were more archaic and less elegant than the average kids thats when i realized it whoever skankhunt42 is on the school message boards it isnt a student its an adult
i think its one of the parents
i had enough examples of the teachers texts and emails to do an emoji analysis they were much more in lines with skankhunts but still not a match
what is it eric whats wrong
come on we dont keep secrets remember
you said you wanted to be perfectly honest with me always
yeah
well im glad you told me cause now i know
of course youve never given me a reason not to believe you babe
you have no reason to worry people will know it wasnt you with emoji analysis everyone will be able to tell exactly where any comments came from
i cant believe it babe i really didnt think things would end up like this
i just feel so disconnected from the world you know i really thought this was gonna be the moment that proved girls could do anything like you always say
im just glad i have you at least i know you believe girls are smart
and funny too right youre always saying how people need to get over that girls are funny
hey are you okay this election really got to you too huh
me too babe me too
hey babe whats the matter
okay
i know babe youve talked about how humankind needs to get to mars for a few weeks now
babe theres no way to get to mars right now
i trust you with everything i have
eric were so far from home
you really think theres hope
you really think this is what we should do babe i gonna miss everyone
oh yeah that movie was funny
wow i guess youre right
what babe
why do you want me telling you jokes all the time
well did i tell you the one about the skeleton and the skunk
i call it "emoji analysis" it isnt a student its an adult
i think its one of the parents
babe i have no idea what any of this means
girls rule women are funny get over it

dude i am so not getting this
i dont understand what any of these symbols mean so in my head im trying to replace them with something i know to try and see patterns
and when i do that i can see how everything lines up except for one thing
i call it "emoji analysis"
these two dont line up babe the only things that are out of order
excuse me is it possible that the seventh line from the right and the third one up from the bottom left are out of sequence
that stuff there its in the wrong place it needs to come before that
theyre out of sequence ill show you
i just-- have a boyfriend who really supports me
theres a bomb threat
babe is everything okay you seemdistantly lately
did i do something wrong
you dont really talk to me the same way you used to oh god im sounding needy huh
eric i just--i hope that youre always honest with me even if you think it might hurt my feelings
wow babe looks like all our dreams are kind of on hold for a while huh
well what do you mean
hey babe how are you doin
we still on for recess
k babe love you
hey stan
can i talk to you about eric
i just wanna make sure hes all right
i dont even know if i should be saying this but eric said he was thinking about killing himself
we broke up and he called saying he was about to do it im still really scared for him
ill send you the voice mail if you promise to keep it private
were getting a lot of attention eric our web sites already full of kids saying they feel the same way as you and want to get help
for wanting to take their own lives
but babe theres a lot of kids who feel the same way you do
i thought this was about raising awareness and helping people
eric come on
eric you need to stop what theyre doing is important
its not about problem-solving eric its about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel people need help sorting out their emotions sometimes and the best thing isnt always quick answers but just being there supporting each other and talking through those feelings
come on there has to be a way we can all work together here
eric
hey babe whats up what are you up to
i just- i thought we were meeting at the park you didnt text or anything

eric you just cant keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar
eric if blood sugar is really the problem then you need to change how you eat right

ive been defending him for so long i dont know how im gonna face people if i finally give up
thanks guys thanks for taking me out this is really fun

im sorry that ive hurt you i think maybe i am just stupid and i dont know what i want and it ends up hurting people
but im the one who-
hey
i wanted to talk to you first
kyle ive been under a lot of stress lately and it was all making me really confused
i was being manipulated and i didnt even see it i never do and i dont think you saw it either kyle
ive come to realize that its not my fault its your fault kyle you made all this happen made me question who i was
shh but its okay you cant help it its how you were raised what you were taught my heritage is irish so im prone to being moody and your heritage well you know you can be a little sneaky sometimes and not even realize it im sorry kyle but everybodys trying to live life the best they can its hard enough without your people always trying to get ahead
hey guys whats up
what are you guys talkin about
bullcrap youre all talkin about me again cause youre judgmental bitches ehhh
i look what
what i look fat is that what you wanna say wendy fuck you bitch
"mehmehmehmehmehhh heidi" im just trying to enjoy my lunch here can i do it without you guys shitting on all over me
you wanted to see me mr mackey
what
judge a special needs science fair ahem no thanks
uhh yeah its saturday and i dont wanna be at skewl
so now im gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids
well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance i dont even know what i want for dinner tonight
youre gonna force me to come to skewl on a saturday
oh what are you gonna call me fat now too it just so happens im a vegan which means itd difficult for me to get enough protein so my body doesnt burn fat it burns muscle which makes it look like im fat but im actually way healthier than any of you
oh goddammit
this is bullcrap how can they force me to be the science fair judge now i know how it feels to be a slave
yes it is am i being paid to judge the science fair no do i have a choice no "ohhh yes masah lemme judge that science fair for ya suh"
theresa dont get all aggro on me because youre pissed off your family lives in a trailer
thats what i said your family lives in a trailer
right thats called a "trailer park"
ill try but shes such a bitch
oh looks like isla has something to say you guys hold on im sure this is going to be really profound go ahead isla knock us out with you wit and satire this should be good you guys
oh hey babe whats going on
nothiiing just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes
butters
how would you like to be the judge for the special ed science fair this weekend
yeah dont make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible
because nobody wants to be trapped in a gym with special ed science
look its all just a complete waste of time its not like the special ed science fair is actually gonna contribute to society
what the hell is going on everywhere i turn people are being given handouts while im forced to work my ass off its total bullshit
relax how can i relax i get straight as i ace every test and who gets all the support the special ed department
fellow students i have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called skewl it is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students are the rest of us not special if we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs then soon we will all be poor and forced to live in a trailer park like theresa
theresa get over it you live in a trailer park its not a big deal
what did you say
get this over with youre supposed to be supporting me
being supportive doesnt mean you criticize me asshole just forget it my point is if the school administration doesnt cancel the science fair i will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination
its cancelled you guys can get all this shit out of here and leave thank you
are you just gonna stand there do something
i want you to have some balls and act like you care about me
call me a bitch again do it call me a bitch again
thats what i thought
if nobody else is going to do anything i will
move it get the fuck out of the way i said get out of the way you assholes
shit
i dont have to listen to anybody
fuck you
well im sick of everyone treating me like shit
