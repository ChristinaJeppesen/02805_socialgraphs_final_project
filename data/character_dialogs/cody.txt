is this classroom 7
my names cody im your smartnician youre havin some intelliproblems with your astutelinks
uh huh well heres the problem your amsrtnames arent intelligrated
if you wanna have those intelligrated with easylink you might wanna upgrade your system to the silver package
let my call my supervisor on the intelliphone
okay there we go your students can buy school lunches now but they wont be able to get grades
well what you probably wanna do is upgrade to intellilink platinum
what exactly do you mean by "work"
oh you want the centurion package thats where we take all the intellilink panels and we rip them off the walls and we burn them then we wipe all the computers of intellilink software and you never deal with us again
right away well alright sir heres a clipboard you can use for students to sign up for counseling and i wanna thank you for choosing intellilink
