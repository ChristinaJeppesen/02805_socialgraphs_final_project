shut up you downloaded a lot of songs says here you even downloaded judas priest thats hard time you boys are lookin at you got anything to say for yourselves
not a big deal you think downloading music for free is not a big deal put your coats on im gonna show you something and i dont think youre gonna like it
this is the home of lars ulrich the drummer for metallica look theres lars now sitting by his pool
this month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool but thanks to people downloading his music for free he must now wait a few months before he can afford it
come theres more heres britney spears private jet notice anything britney used to have a gulfstream iv now shes had to sell it and get a gulfstream iii because people like you chose to download her music for free the gulfstream iii doesnt even have a remote control for its surround-sound dvd system still think downloading music for free is no big deal
that is the folly of man now look in this window here you see the loving family of master p next week is his sons birthday and all hes ever wanted was an island in french polynesia
i see an island without an owner if things keep going the way they are the child will not get his tropical paradise
man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else i fear recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury
its all right i think these boys learned their lesson
if you parents will just step over here you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees
not a big deal huh come with me im gonna show you something and i dont think youre gonna like it
all right folks this is the little boy were looking for leopold stotch also known as butters hes been missing for two days and was last seen at the school lets go find him
all right folks i wanna thank you for all your efforts three days is a long time but weve got to keep going if were gonna find him
many times in cases like these a child can trap themselves it is important that we spread our search to duct pipes wells and bomb shelters
i say we need to move the search to ducts wells and bomb shelters lets move out people every second counts
all right kid end of the line
well kid you made an entire town panic you lost all your friends and now youre going to juvenile hall for a week huh was it worth it
'''' whatcha got
so what's the problem
by god so he is black and rich time to take this mr jefferson down just like we did kobe
let's go people
we've got another rich black guy i want him humiliated and dragged through the dirt and i want it done by the books
'''' murphy you inside
johnson what about you
frakes
all right when this jefferson guy shows up arrest him fast and try not to beat him there could be neighbors with video cameras '''' why do we do it harris
why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy african-americans with crimes they didn't commit
twenty-five years i've been on the force i've seen every kind of sick depraved act known to humanity and still when i see a black man walk by who has more money than me i want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter but why maybe there is no reason maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride
hey har- har- harris harris
it's jefferson he's back '''' all right people let's give blacky a nice welcome home
whoa wait a minute '''' that guy isn't black
holy god his son isn't black either oh jesus '''' this is yates stand down i repeat stand down suspect is not black
you son of a bitch you told my this guy was african-american
'''' does that look like a black guy to you
'''' jesus christ monkeyballs we could have made an innocent man go to jail who ''wasn't black'' oh
wuuugh wuugh ohaugh ugh
jesus harris what are we becoming we're supposed to protect the people where have we lost our way
'''' to hell with you i'm never gonna frame an innocent man again unless i ''know'' he's black for sure
i'm givin' up maggie i'm quitting the force
none of it makes sense anymore '''' i don't even know if what we're doing is right the last thirteen hours we've been working on a case trying to get a real scumbag off the streets and when he walked up to the door i could have sworn he was white maybe i can't tell the difference anymore maybe it doesn't matter because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy he's back out on the streets in no time it's just like oj do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him the tireless hours they put in and then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the n word out loud too many times i guess i'm just tired i'm just damn tired
and you're a good wife maggie you know me better than i know myself ''''
think i've got a little more work to do ''''
hello this is sergeant yates over at the park county police department in colorado
well we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area one martin jefferson
well he doesn't really look that black
you say he disappeared what did you frame him for
molestation nice
that's damn fine police work sergeant damn fine
'''' jesus christ monkeyballs it must be the same guy
'''' freeze jefferson the gig is up you are wanted for child mo-les-tation
'''' well if you're gonna give away all your money then i guess we can drop all those charges no point in putting another poor black man in jail
