can i help you sir
oh yeah sorry thats gone we only sell marijuana here
sure new state laws say its okay
alright ill just need to see your physicians reference
well sir we just cant sell the marijuana to anybody you need a reference from your doctor to show its necessary
im sorry sir but you have to be inside the store
selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal
look im sorry but the bill says i cant modify any existing structure
look cant we skip all this and just make pot legal everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway its ridiculous
