i know that i was being f-f-f-facetious
ooh christopher reeve whoop-de-freakin-do
i put together a comedy show and i was crippled from birth
can you believe this asswipe timmy
why is a celebrity who became crippled more important than us that were born that way very much
hey there fellas
say would you guys like to join our club oh im sorry you cant you arent crippled
to be in our club not only do you have to be c-c-crippled but you have to have been born that way do you know what that means no butthole superman asswipe christopher reeve
sorry able-bodied you cant join
hey timmy how many able-bodied people does it take to screw in a light bulb one you know what you call an able-bodied guy on the doorstep whatever his name is
hello mr mcgillicuuhuhuhh mr mcgillicuddy
timmy and i made a t-shirt design for our new club we just came up with a name this morning
why not
theres already a crips
no we never have are they crippled from birth or are they cripple wannabes like christopher reeve
can you believe it timmy all this time there was a group for truly crippled people like ourselves and we didnt know it
come on we have to take the bus to five points in denver
excuse me sir were looking for a group of people called the crips
do you know where they meet weve already tried the rec center and the library
oh its okay were crips ourselves come on tim-tim
well hello everyone im jim swanson and this is my friend timmy
well let us tell you a little bit about ourselves timmy and i are both true crips born and raised were the only crips in south park where we live and we would love to join your fa-fa-fantastic denver chapter
we just have one question before we join your c-club do you think its better to be born a crip or to become a crip later by accident
i agree i mean its like "come on" why do these people who become crippled later in life think theyre such great pot-potatuhs
well were glad you see it our way fellas so can we join your g group
well sure tim and i would love to pop some punk-ass bloods were terrific at it
i dont know timmy just play along
down like a clown charlie br down like a clown charlie b-broooowww down like a clown charlie browh bro-uh-own down like a clown charlie br-brown
say timmy did you notice that all the crippled people in that club are negros
thats an amm-mmazing coincidence i mean theres not one crippled colored person in south park
well hello officers
were goin to pop some punk-ass bloods
look timmy theres a convenience store that must be what the fellas meant by "pop some punk-ass bloods" they want us to get them some soda pop and treats lets buy them ginger ale and marshmallows then theyll let us in the club for sure
suh suh suh suh sssunday driver
so does that mean we can join the c-cclub
wow these guys really are crippled timmy i have a feeling that this is the start of something b-b-b-bb-b-brilliant
thanks for the ride home fellas we sure had a terrific time
you dawgs keep it real too
well that sure was a terrific time lets go all around tomorrow and show everyone our new outfits timmy
whatup mazie ye-yo pops

well gee thats really nice of you mr chinese person look tim-tim we got a cash prize we must be the one hundredth customer or something
actually it was a regular lemonade
gee thanks a lot see you next time
yo mamsie whats up pops
a what oh you mean the fellas well sure but i cant talk about the club on account of its sssuper secret dawg
why you be trippin mom i mean come on im finally a part of something very much
yo dont be dissing my n***as dawg theyre my f-friends
nobody cared about my standup comedy all that hard work just to be outshined by c-christopher reeve the super b-butthole
right because you and mom used to make fun of crippled kids in high school
look my gang which i cant talk about because its super secret is the most important thing to me now and if you two dont like it you can just pass the blunt to the n***a on your left
sixty-five bottles of beer on the wall six-
jesus christ holy gguacamole freakin frijoles leapin l-langosta
any word on who shot up me and timmys houses officer
the b-bloods
the-they do
but but why do they hate each other
oh so you used sssytemm cells like christopher reeve
oh boy timmy we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth now theyre at war with the people who are crippled from an accident boy were we wrong
wow w-weve got to do something timmy weve gotta get the crips and bloods to s-stop fighting i bet if we could just get them together but how wu-wait a minute ive got it a lock-in at the rec center we did it for our church once all we do is rent out the rec center overnight they lock the doors so nobody can leave and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk
you get all the crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night timmy and ill try to get all the bloods there
this is gonna be t-terrific
come on in everybody lots of su-surprises and t-treats inside great to see you all what a terrific audience
we sure do thanks mr appleb-by
you bet
oh we will
its called a lock-in at the rec center we can use all the rec center facilities we can play basketball go swimming or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and p-puzzles
but nobody can leave until its seven am so if you wanna have a good time youre all just gonna have to learn to get along theeerrres pizzaaa
hold it dont you see it doesnt matter if we were crippled from birth or crippled in an accident were all brothers
look we have the whole rec room to ourselves cant we all just try having some fun together
why dont we at least give it a chance i mean come on
i said "i mean come on"
come on
come on
i told you lock-ins at the rec center always work and you know ive learned something too i was player-hatin christopher butthole reeve because he got more attention than me but just like y-you guys i need to learn to control my a anger
i guess we all learned that trying to get along is way better than p player hatin the gang wrote a song about it why dont we listen in
well sure eric w-w-what seems to be the p-p-p-problem
well the best thing is not to act nice eric uh the best thing is to be genuinely nice
well eric pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh the best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- antduhh anecdote
well like try this one on for size knock knock
ing-mar bergman now you say "ingmar bergman who"

you too francis
oh he-hey n-nathan
yeah it sure is tough im training really hard but im not improving fast enough and the special olympics are a week away
what kind of shortcuts
s-s-ss-s-s-steroids but arent those illegal
so uh ha-how do they w-w-work
how much would this cost me
well then maybe ill just use them a-al-little bit you know as a performance
oh agh ju-just a second
hang on im-im coming
i said im coming give me a goddamned s-second
n-no dad
oh hi n-n-nancy

look its my b-body and its my choice what i put in it
dont lecture me on the complexities of sportsmanship you know as well as i do most of the kids in special olympics arent shooting up to compete im just trying to k-keep up
s-s-s-so what are you gonna do now huh you gonna be a fuckin narc and show that b-bottle to the coaches dont think youre any better than me timmy im just living in the real world fuck
y-yeess grrrr

you f-f f-faked being handicapped to win i should kick your ass right here you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater
what
oh my god you-youre right timmy youre totally right
everyone can i have your attention please im afraid i have to give back my medal the truth is i havent been playing fair either ive been using st-steroids i was willing to do anything to be the best and the steroids made me blind to the people i was hurting a good friend even tried to talk me out of it and i wouldnt listen to him taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the special olympics
because youre taking all the fairness out of the game but i know now that even if you do win on steroids youre really not a winner youre just a p-pussy youre just a big fat p-p-pussy and if you take steroids the only decent thing to do is come forward and say "remove me from the record books because i am a big stinky p-pussy- " "-steroid-taking jackass" thats how i feel about myself and why i must decline this medal and my place in the history books and if youll let me ill be back next year to compete with honor
thats a fantastic idea fellas uh the key to successful humor is s-staying power uh tell me the first mascot idea
heh huh okay thats pretty funny now whats the second
turhr ohokahay okay now lets wait ten seconds okay now t-tell me the first one again
and the second
gee th-theyre both screamingly funny fellas better give it another ten seconds all right now well see which one really has staying power number one
okay i think thats it number 2
gee i dont know what to say fellas theyre both instant classics but i guess ill have to go with giant douche simply because the fact that its a giant renders it useless adding a parody slant to the satire

i-i dont see a b-b-bat-mobile
wop wop wop wop wopwop gangnam style
this is an outrage who out there is saying that our friend stan is a liar
yeah i love when morgan freeman explains stuff
he said "at ruh ruh rruh ruh reh red"
ruh rehh red
heheh i get it general tsos chih-chih-chicken
just old junk and boxes of erics moms d-dildos
theres nothing here kyle not even one s-s-scooby clue
there he is hey kyle the parental lock isnt working our parents are still watching murder porn
uh im just gettin ready for cla-
m ma um m-me too
eh but i want a ps4 not a crappy xbox
yeah
you know that the ps4 is a better choice i mean come on
ya yo you cant you cant do that
come on sir stan there must be kids somewhere who will join us
c-c-cartmans army is getting bigger every day in addition to the federation and the kindergartners the xbox army now also has the kids who play harry potter the jocks the swim team and the glee club
uh besides us its the book club and janice pinkerton
look sir stan its probably time to give this up
its the enemy defensive po-po-p-po-p-positions
thats right red robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall
yeah thats thats thats pretty nice
hey stan did you see clydes going out with lisa b-b-berger
yeah i wouldnt mind t-tah-t-tappin that ass
well y-you gotta admit lisa berger is pretty hot wendy
thats not very nice wendy
wow wow she looks great
i thought you guys said you didnt need school
yeah well no ones laughing kyle
no food at a party and i thought i was handicapped
yeah she isnt as hot in person
hey craig have you checked out the internet lately
ohhhh nothin its just that y-you might wanna invest in some hedge clippers
ohhhh nothin you just might wanna hire tarzan to do some landscaping work for your mom
oh hey kyle kyle hang on a sec
not much i just wanted to make sure you heard the fuh-fantastic news theres a new terrance & phillip mobile game and its so amazing and incredibly fun
yeah and the most unbelievable part its totally free you should download it to your phone right now i mean come on if its free why wouldnt you
you betcha pal
pssst hey kid come over here yeah come on over ch-check this out you looking to have some fun
the terrance & phillip mobile game all the cool kids are usin it
come on just try it out you can be terrance or phillip or both you can walk around and collect canada cash to build new stuff its the perfect thing if youre bored and honestly the best part about it is its free i mean come on why wouldnt you download it and just try it out
why sure fellas anyway be sure to check it out kid
just hangin out what are you up to
i just think its a fabulous app thats all
alright alright i never played it i stay away from the stuff
they pay me to
is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time i was just a middleman people were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me im not the one who made it
how do you get people addicted to crack you give it away for free you give away a little taste and then and then some people cant stop themselves
i needed the money alright i downloaded yum yum sparkly gem forest because it was free i love the sparkly little gems the sounds they made when i got new ones then i made my first in-app purchase before i knew it i had spent my allowance then my birthday money i lost my crutches
its a figure of speech with crippled people wed say we lost an arm and a leg but they aint worth much
why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you havent played in a while its called a trigger a quick image to trigger the addicts brain they know exactly what theyre doing
fellas can i have a moment with stan please
this is my fault stan i should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic
i know this stuff is hard to understand trust me i know im an addict too but i got help
what all the addiction programs say is true youve gotta reach out to a higher power stan youve gotta get down on your knees and youve gotta say "i have a problem" and youve gotta ask that higher power for help
fantastic girls volleyball joke stan
yeah what is this yaoi thing all about i am so c-c-c-confused
well dad i just re-really like being a part of something i feel like its character-building and its lots of fun
what do we believe in we believe in something greater than ourselves and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior and as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies wow the fellas were right people are really freaked out by ninjas
its jimmy actually my name is jimmy pc principal

no
youre new here so you dont understand how seriously i take my job as editor of the school paper i dont allow ads and i dont allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking i dont want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog

does she know shes an ad
for years mankind has tried to rid the world of ads for our ancestors ads couldnt be avoided but everyone knew what was an ad and what wasnt after many years mankind invented cable a way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads but somehow the ads still found a way and so mankind invented tivo a way to skip past commercials finally it appeared to be the end of ads and everywhere people rejoiced the ads were stopped or so it seemed with the rise of the internet suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us popups the top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads once and for all they invented the ad blocker suddenly there were no ads on phones on computers and everywhere people rejoiced the ads adapted they became s-smarter they disguised themselves as news all around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads and now the ads have taken the next step in their evolution they have taken human form ads are among us they could be your friend your g-gardener the ads are trying to wipe us out but the question is how
its just my luck i talk to a nice girl seem to hit it off and she turns out to just be an ad
this is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper why dont we just run it so that everyone knows the truth

just you know plans like what are you hoping tooo accomplish
well i want to pursue careers in both news reporting and comedy

shes ag- emotional
interesting caring girl
okay leslie lets try a different approach lets say you wanted tooo destroy the entire species how would you go about it
and what is the new principal trying to do leslie
