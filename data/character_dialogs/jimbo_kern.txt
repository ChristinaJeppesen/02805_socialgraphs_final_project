our south park cows have just beaten the washington dodgeball team and are on their way to the world championship in china
hi im jimbo kern and this here is ned say hi ned
arrgh-ha-ha-ha now isnt that great
we have a terrific show for you today were gonna kill some elk and were gonna kill some mountain goats now the new law passed by colorado legislature which ned and i call "pussy law #4" states that we can no longer kill animals in defense"pussy law #4"no animal shall be harmedeven in self defense unlessspecific license and season isin order self defense can onlybe justified by extreme provableperil and or documented visiblebodily harmin other words our old line of "its comin right for us"--
--no longer works so now we only kill animals to quote "thin out their numbers" if we dont hunt then these animals will grow too big in number and they wont have enough food so you see we have to kill animals or else theyll die
uhh so roll the tape
here we are at schaefers crossing lookin for some animals
jimbo
jimbo
ned
that sure was a great hunting trip we saved those deer from extinction
comin up next were gonna drop some napalm on an unsuspecting family of beavers and also try to thin out the numbers of some endangered species
and now time for jimbos mysteries of the unexplained
one of our loyal viewers from south park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka now as you all know the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze if a person even so much as looks into the frogs eyes they can be paralyzed or even die and this film proves that that frog may very well exist
now watch carefully youre gonna see the mexican staring frog
there there did you see it roll that back again
now freeze it
well id like to know what all you skeptics have to say now what do you think ned
well be sure to join us next time until thenwere so glad you spent your time with uswhile we slaughtered our way through natures gutscome again and stay a whilewell kill a lot more living things to make them bleed
oh lookie whos here my little nephew stanley
so youre interested in your uncle jimbos big tv show huh

well sure vietnam was fun but not like goin-to-the-circus fun or fly-fishin-in-montana fun no vietnam was more like shovin shards of broken glass up your ass and then sittin in a tub of tabasco sauce fun

yes now were about to roll the film but remember if you look the mexican staring frog in the eyes you could go catatonic we dont know if this applies to pictures of the frog or not but who wants to take chances so when we roll this film be sure to look away
okay roll the film tom
is it over okay its over
well there you have it undeniable proof that the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka exists
and you saw it here on the jimbo and ned show
well it appears as though a lot of you "skeptics" thought that the film we showed of the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka was a fake that you say it didnt harm anybody well it just so happens that we just received another film from another anonymous viewer roll it
there you go proof that not only is this frog real but it is doing harm to the people of south park as we speak

alrighty everyone we just have a few things to go over before we head out to the reenactment battlefield first of all i have great news there are over 200 folks from around the state that have come to see this years reenactment and thats the best turnout ever
im also very proud to announce that this years alcohol sponsor jagermins smore-flavored schnapps the schnapps with the delightful taste of smores
and now to clarify how the reenactment should unfold lets bring up our master historian grandpa marvin marsh the only man old enough to have actually seen the civil war reenactment of 1924
now remember everybody for a good reenactment weve got to pretend down to the last detail that were really in the civil war so when the north wins all of us on the confederate side should act all bummed and depressed
and with that lets all go to tamarack hill and put on a good show
forward
fire
alrighty everyone were going to do the entire reenactment again because of some confusion over the bell now i know youre just trying to help eric but we have to let the union capture the bell this time
wuh well cause were supposed to lose
what
by god hes right
yeah ive been reenacting this war for 22 years now and for 22 years us confederate reenactors have had to spend the evening being ridiculed and made fun of by the union reenactors well im sick of it
and i say its high time we kicked some ass whos with me

surrender your men general
the south wins
well we can all be friends now come on randy have some smore schnapps

ill bet we could too
what is that a challenge ill bet we can
pussies oh yeah men its time to show the world what the confederate army has got were gonna take topeka once and for all
all o you men you may have lost in the union today but join us now and win back your pride

ey general hes reenacting jefferson davis you cant talk that way to a superior officer
all right well i think we got what we wanted
lincoln and davis signed the treaty general the war is over
mayor its about the south park flag
we cannot change the south park flag mayor
chef i respect you very much but you have to understand that this has been the south park flag since some of our ancestors like my great-grandfather founded this land
chef what about the baseball team the cleveland indians huh should they change their name because its racist
no because its their history
and im telling you it wont
this is about history kids if you dont have respect for your past then you can never expect to- bird -then you can never expect to have a future nowadays everyone wants to change mascots and flags because theyre not "politically correct" well where does it end i mean people are gonna start sayin that the denver broncos are offensive to horses and then well have to- a squirrel and then well have to change everything and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten but to really understand the south parks flags importance you need to know about south parks history ned heres a big history buff and he can tell you the whole story ned
you sure
you boys go make me proud now and win that debate- chris peterson god-damnit we missed him again
dont change history
huh uh hey now uh we dont want your support were not racists this is about history
dont change history
ned nobodys gonna vote for our side if its the side those kkk members are on come on we gotta put a stop to them
alright ned weve got to be careful these are really evil men were dealing with
damnit ned doesnt that thing have a volume control
lets say they should change the flag
i think we should switch sides
look we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us right
so whatever side were on is the side thats gonna lose right
so why dont we all say that we want the flag changed that way most folksll vote to keep it the way it is
that worked perfectly ned
jesus ned these guys are completely nuts
that is the most insane thing ive ever seen i cant believe those people are on our side i mean is our side that crazy oh hello chef big debate tomorrow i guess oh jesus the robes chef this isnt what it looks like youve gotta listen to us
ned im starting to think that maybe history aint worth defendin sometimes
yeah you know uh i suddenly found myself on the side of klan members ive never had anything against blacks chef
weve been way too divisive over this chef maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with
i have to admit it that is a lot nicer
holy crow look boys a real live wild turkey its tryin to outsmart us come on fellas
there it is hey hey i saw it first i get the first shot here turkey turkey

well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store
w-hell naturally you could cross the line for that just like we could cross the line for hardware supplies gas and pharmaceutical needs
all right thats fine because our war support songs will be a thousand times better
yeah the last thing these people want is a bleedin-heart rock protest song
well cant we stop them lets call the bank
