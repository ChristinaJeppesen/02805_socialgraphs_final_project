mr garrison the guy with the puppet
well i must say garrison perhaps youre not as stupid and crazy as i always tell people you are
well i cant just shut them down this is a free country
look the best i can do is create a proposition well call it prop 10 the town can vote on it and if it passes well see what we can do
so i guess you wanna do some campaigning you can do commercials and things like that and then well have a vote in the middle of town and obviously if more than 50% of the people even show up
and care enough to want harbucks out then theyre out so good luck to you
alright whats next
tomorrow for the prop 10 vote well set up ballot booths here all right men well throw up the stage here before the vote well get a band everyone likes like uhhhh like
like toto and then the harbucks guy will have five minutes to speak and the boys will have five minutes to speak and then the town votes
aalll right people the next order of business is a very serious matter we need to vote on whether south park should reinstate the death penalty or not all those in favor say "yippee"
all those opposed say "nay"

mr lu kim tear down this wall
these boys symbolize how we all feel about loss who are we to tell them its impossible
good evening everyone in a moment well be lighting the south park christmas tree to kick off the holidays
but now before we light the tree i think we should all reflect for a moment on those who are less fortunate than us right now in iraq there are children who fear us and what we might do to their country the threat of war touches us all but over in iraq there is no christmas they have nothing
ahalright here to light the christmas tree is a very special young man who shows us all the true meaning of christmas jimmy
well wed love a christmas song wouldnt we folks
thats it thats it the songs over we can light the tree
go on jimmy theres only five more seconds until christmas
and so without further ado heres the most courageous most amazing man on the planet christopher reeve
okay people what are we rambling about now
quiet people the town square is public space that means if neither group will nicely and maturely move the day of its rally ill just have to give the town square to both groups
people i told you you have to share the stage
and thats really all i can tell you the town of south park is going to be leveled in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway
the native americans have purchased the land out from under us tomorrow theyre buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership
the native americans bought the bank
now look it isnt all horrible the native americans are offering you retail values on your homes
three hundred thousand dollars
as we celebrate this glorious time we cant forget those families who are suffering as many of you know the broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them as a community we must do all we can to ease their pain are there any suggestions how we might help
mr garrison every christmas you suggest we get rid of all the mexicans and every christmas we tell you "no"
then its settled this year well give all our christmas money to the broflovskis in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them
all right people we are all extremely upset over whats happened but lets try to speak one at a time
as it was in the times of our forefathers so it is now stan marsh for not following our most sacred of rites you are hereby banished from south park for all eternity or until you decide that voting is important good-bye stan may the gods treat you more kindly than we did

latino-american
you should go away you dont belong anywhere in a town as progressive as this one

the town is in danger alright we dont know what these kids are capable of
sh look look look barbrady barbrady we were wrong about you i was wrong about you you protected this town back before anybody else ever did you used to do it all on your own we need you to do that again
what were you thinking boys innocently playing ninja and you pull your gun on them
we thought they were but if it turns out they arent as a policeman you have to figure that out
im sorry but we just cant cover your ass on this one theres going to be an investigation and you just dont have what it takes to be a policeman in todays times
yes
students and parents i know that you are all concerned about the witch who is preying upon our town and i wanna speak to you all about how to try and protect yourselves but first some gentlemen have asked to speak on what they perceive to be a "witch pursuit thing"

ive asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news
lets just get this over with all right send him in
mr hankey we called you in to let you know that your christmas pageant funding has been cut by half
we just dont have the support for the christmas show that we used to the truth is some people find you offensive
the decision has already been made thank you mr hankey and good luck with the show
hankey we need to talk about what you tweeted
no im talking about what you tweeted last night "the city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking islamists"
im afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council
no goodbyes mr hankey you just need to go we already called you a poober

okay that was the south park soundaroos thanks again to kate and earl alright up next we have four of our local south park fourth graders who have formed a band lets hear it for stan marsh and crimson dawn
mr marsh do you remember a few weeks ago when homes in south park were attacked by a terrorist called mexican joker
right except there was no mexican joker it was you who blew up peoples yards because they were home-growing their own marijuana
the tweeks have come forward with some footage caught on their security camera
run the footage please
people are fed up marsh the past few weeks youve held parades for yourself needlessly slaughtered a thousand cows made deals with the chinese and nearly poisoned everyone with your halloween special everyones had enough of tegridy farms
youll be taken to county jail to await your trial get him out of here
well at least now south park can start getting back to normal
in the south park vs tegridy farms matter we are now ready to proceed with the arraignment before doing so mr marsh do you have any words
alright everyone are we enjoying the festivities well its time for a very special guest now here he is santa
okay thank you santa that was wonderful and informative thank you for coming everyone we hope your and your loved ones enjoy all your favorite holiday traditions
nobodys out shopping the town is dead our economy depends on the holidays
theres only one thing we can do were going to have to ask an old friend for help and hope that he somehow forgives us
mr marsh south park needs you
everyones down in the dumps nobodys buying presents or going to holiday events
we think that a little weed might put everyone in a better mood
we understand but couldnt you do like a limited-edition run just to get people through the holidays
yes south park needs tegridy farms
ill tell you how because youre randy marsh and theres one thing you have that nobody else does tegridy

what is wrong with you we cant have you selling this stuff in town cocaine is illegal
jesus christ you cant just give people coke without them knowing we could all go to prison
it- it is
for christs sake the entire town is in chaos how the hell did you let those kids out of quarantine
everyone is terrified of catching something from these super-spreaders
we certainly dont want you teachers to be without every resource available ill write an executive order to get you everything you need
people this is the most exciting time in the history of south park as you know there are people from all over the country leaving the cities and coming to small rural towns like ours
ive always dreamed of south park becoming more than a little hick town and these city people bring with them a new hope
people we have a giant problem there are now so many city people looking for houses in south parkthat it could destroy our rebounding economy
