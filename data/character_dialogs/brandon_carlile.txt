brandon carlile reporter spin magazine i was hoping you could help me make sense of somethin i understand you had a very large party in your back yard last last sunday was it
i also understand that a very famous pop artist lorde was the entertainment at that party
well it eh its just a little curious you know why a hugely popular top-20 artist would play such a well no offence but such a humble venue
you understand we deal with a lot of fake stories at spin was just wondering how the boys got someone like lorde to play
you wouldnt know who
lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady it would be a shame if someone was having fun at her expense
