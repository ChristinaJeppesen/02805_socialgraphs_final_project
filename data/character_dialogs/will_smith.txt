ooo look at this honey a beautiful unspoiled town in the rockies this is just what weve been looking for
we could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing and then i could finally live like a cowboy
o kids
how would you like to move to the colorado rockies
you bet
well here it is our home to be
why thank you young man were the smiths
how quaint kids why dont you play with little tolkien while your mother and i check out the town
great snoop dogg and you
great snoop-snoop listen remember how we always talked about wanting to buy property up in the mountains so our kids could ski and ride horses
well i found the place snooty-roo its in the rockies but totally undiscovered laid-back and beautiful
you really should come give it a look jada and i would love for some friends to move here with us
great well let me let you get back to your recording
