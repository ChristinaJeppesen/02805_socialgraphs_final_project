i might be craig and then again i might not be my identity must remain a secret you cannot know
i assume you must be cartman because youre fat
i really dont care who you are
kyle hates eric cartman are you saying youre eric cartman
i cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer the city needs my help there are innocents to protect
i could no longer sit by and watch as my city became a cesspool of crime i have lived in south park all my life i decided it was up to me to keep this town safe nobody at school knows my double life to them im just another fourth grader but tonight i am mysterion
theres some graffiti on the bridge again i think those sixth grade kids are doing it and the guy at the movie theater is harassing mexicans again
this city needs my help it cries for protection and i will-
i dont have time for this
hello kyle
do not be afraid i mean you no harm
yes but now i believe someone is trying to learn my true identity
i cannot be unmasked for then i would stop being a symbol i need help somebody who can do background checks for me do some investigating
because i think you are the smartest kid in class
why are you doing this this isnt your usual mo chaos
what next time
citizens tonight has shown me i have no choice but to unmask myself
no its true as long as my identity is a mystery this will just happen again and again it has to end i will show my face
who cares if a hero doesnt want to be part of coon and friends
look all we need to do is wait for the next disaster then try to beat hindsight to the scene
my god another oil spill could mean absolute devastation for the gulf
agreed
we all have a say in this organization coon let mosquito talk
those people down there need help sometimes being a hero means helping in smaller ways
he means we need to discuss things with you
aw i dont wanna tell him tupperwear you tell him
but we get the headquarters and all the equipment
weve already discussed this with her mrs cartman
please escort the coon out of our secret base
i am mysterion though only nine years old i dedicate my life to helping people - when im not in school for months now ive been protecting my town from crime but now something has happened that even i cannot fight alone the bp oil company has drilled and caused a spill in the gulf like no other the president of bp apologized
but they drilled again and tore open a portal into another dimension
creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the gulf bp tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon but instead they caused the dark lord cthulhu to emerge
i have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the gulf but even the other heroes do not know that unlike them i do have a power a power they will now begin to understand and all will know who and what i truly am
thank you maam
we believe that every little bit helps
mysterion
because it pisses cartman off beyond belief and i find that extremely funny
i dont know but i think wed better find out
not cartman
whoever did this to our base was looking for something
chaos why did you take those pictures
hindsight that isnt courtney love our former member the coon tricked you
please sir put down the gun
then do it pull the trigger hindsight if you dont believe us then you dont have a choice pull the trigger you pussy
you guys go ill deal with this prick
i said its fine just go
people need you hindsight without you they feel helpless and stupid
you think your powers a curse let me tell you something about curses buttlicker because theres some superpowers that make yours look like nothing trust me i know
i cant die ive experienced death countless times sometimes i see a bright light sometimes i see heaven or hell but eventually no matter what i wake up in my bed wearing my same old clothes and the worst part nobody even remembers me dying i go to school the next day and everyone is just like "oh hey kenny" even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes you wanna whine about curses hindsight youre talking to the wrong fucking cowboy
what should i do should i forget about the past and not care about my powers
maybe i should just disappear
im fine
so these people have been waiting for cthulhu a long time
uhh what what the fuck i m-i mean uh i mean what the fuck
im not here about that
ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult
mysterion what is the cult of cthulhu
what happened at those meetings
i dont find that hard to believe at all
these people still meet where
there must be clubs like this all over the world
makes sense unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth
what does it mean "that is not dead which can eternal lie"
what does it mean
youre going to tell me everything you know
you are going to be okay karen you have to keep believing that
sometimes people do stupid things sometimes they dont realize what should have come first until its too late
you are not alone no matter where you go no matter what you do i will always be here do you understand
dont try karen do
how about you find another little girl to pick on
karen mccormick is off limits do you understand make sure everybody in this school knows
