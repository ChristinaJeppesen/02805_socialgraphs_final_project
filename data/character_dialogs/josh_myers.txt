thats a terrible cologne youre wearing officer you should try something more casual
and why would i do that because im such a charming fella
due to the harsh nature of my crimes they dont allow me to have toilet paper in my cell you can imagine how bothersome that becomes
no but it was worth a try wasnt it tell me something officer why is it that you police such a small town you must have had larger inspirations what happened to those big-city dreams
quid pro quo officer tell me what i want to know and ill help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house
are those the crime scene photos let me see them yes yes not bad work not bad at all these toilet-paperers are professionalsat least one of them is
tell me something first when you went to the academy you had something to prove you wanted to protect and serve but mostly you wanted to protect yourself who were you protecting yourself from officer barbrady
thank you your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins parents notice that much toilet paper missing so they would have to have bought it themselves find out where the toilet paper came from officer and you just might catch your man
the answer is right in front of you but you cant see it
tell me the toilet paper was it quilted
single-sheet
why does one toilet-paper houses
no that is incidental your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teachers house thus transforming her entire occupation
your uncle who hit you with a belt was he a large man
did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin down at the pool house
whoa uh oh thank you your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teachers class students who arent very good at art
fly along now officer barbrady youve got some arrests to make fly fly flyyy fly fly flyyy
no sir
whats the matter principal victoria was your mother abusive did she spank your thighs with cold cuts and stick umbrellas up your ass
ooh policeman brown never quite made officer why is that policeman brown
hello officer barbrady
im afraid that giving away my location might be harmful to my freedom officer i just wanted to thank you for helping me get out of that dingy cell
sorry officer gotta run theres something ive been meaning to do for quite some time ciao
