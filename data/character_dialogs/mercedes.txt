okay i know its your first day ferrari so i wanna go over the basics with you
first of all theres a five foot rule if you come within five feet of a customer you need to acknowledge them even if theyre not at your table "hey cutie" when youre not serving food or talking with customers you need to dance around and have fun we use things like hula hoops silly strings and water guns to play with the other girls be sure to giggle a lot and be sure to show off your raisins now when you take a customers order you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think youre interested write your name down for them and make them feel special "oh man i am so bored thank god you guys came in" if you want good tips the most important thing is physical contact just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars "ill be right back with your order guys"
