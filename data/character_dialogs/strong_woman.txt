thank you pc principal alright everyone listen up im the new vice principal of this school my name is strong woman ive already spent a few days here at the school watching and observing and we definitely have things we can all be working on
you really think i couldnt have handled that myself
you really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that
i want the girls here at this school to know that they can talk to me about anything but i also want the boys to know what im looking for is a better place for everybody turning this school around is going to take work from everyone
sorry am i not doing this correctly
you felt it wasnt strong enough me just saying it
im looking forward to being your vice principal and im looking forward to turning this school around
im not finished
thanks everyone alright listen up i fully appreciate that some of you might be uncomfortable with me being here earlier today i noticed that some faculty werent sure whether to call me "miss woman" or just "strong" if i were a man youd probably address me as vice principal woman so why should it be any different huh we good
so ive been getting to know some of the students here and im definitely hearing a lot of frustration and confusion over issues that all the schools are facing right now i also spent some time observing in the cafeteria and was pretty shocked by the abusive and intolerant language not sure if any of you have noticed but a lot of the girls are eating their lunches out on the playground to avoid being around the toxic environment thats been created its my intention to make the cafeteria pe class is another huge problem at this school the girls gym outfits seem not to have been updated since the 60s we have a lot of work to do here i intend to do it quickly
its its coming from over here somewhere
you may enter
yes what can i do for you
please by all means
you want to blame farts that seems kind of ridiculous doesnt it
i mean its a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings
kind of sounds like something my mother would say actually
what the hell is that
lets go everyone to the gymnasium now
im coming too im your vice principal
whats wrong
okay
what what
yes there is
why do you need to open the door
somebodys gonna have to open the door or we could die out here
mr white we assure you that we run this school in a very professional manner and dont let personal emotions get in the way
uh no mr and mrs white we promise that we will not let anything happen that might bring the integrity of this school into question
we have a reservation
woman
strong
we cant keep doing this people are gonna see through it
nobody will understand
oh my god
i told you we couldnt hide
yes pc principal
what would we need to discuss
hey i am a strong woman all right i dont get manipulated we both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace but that was long ago and i have decided to move forward
why not we make a mistake we move forward
nope were just gonna forget about it and put it to rest
no i dont bye-bye
thats right kids many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives they can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown persons sperm in a lab
ooohhhhhhh
oh ooohhhhhhh
im fine
thats my water breaking not a big deal
i didnt need your help
yeah well people might get the wrong idea i have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible a person little girls could look up to if those girls thought i was the type to get knocked up by my boss-
theres nothing to discuss i made a mistake and i am moving forward
my babies where are they
you shouldnt be here people will start getting suspicious
nobody took advantage of me
and im a strong woman
oh yes that curriculum should be fine for the students ill start working on an all-school proposal
its okay shhh we just need to get some diapers shhh
ohhh what adorable little babies
thank you
my they look very pc
oh no no theyre not very pc at all
they actually arent pc
oh god shhhh nonononono sheee
i told you we need to shop separately sh shhh
theyre so pc like whoever their father is well never keep them quiet our only hope is to keep them hidden
we did the most un-pc thing imaginable think about what that would do to them we can never let them know the debaucherous sickening circumstances that brought them into this world
and ill be their strongest vice principal and hopefully the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them
children everyone just stay back okay the police are coming
oh thank god some kindergartners found the body i-i dont think it was a shooting
over there
i could use a little help here
riley said a word her sister felt was insensitive to muslims now theyre all upset
she just said "aba daba"
oh yeah that would be really smart if anybody sees them theyre gonna figure out youre the father
you wanna risk that the babies have to stay hidden because if people know the truth then youre not pc and im not strong
i was stressed out and feeling anxious after just 8 to 10 hours in buddha box i feel refreshed and ready to take on anything
what the fuck are you doing hey what the fuck are you doing
with a box on your head
i dont need a box on my head to use the phone
all right riley give that back to your brother bailey no harper dont har-per
river bailey emory
i cant believe you were on your phone
it was my time to be on the phone you were on yours all morning
yes
oh god im not doing this again
no no we dont want to file anything specific we just need help finding some pc babies
nono its five specific pc babies
no no these pc babies wouldnt have gotten that far they can barely walk im their mother
woman
strong
dont be ridiculous
im not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss i am a strong woman those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization
well uh see what we can do in the meantime youll just have to take a seat and wait
riley
youre okay thank god
im their vice principal
they did all that
ive always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about but its only made it worse
yeah i think so
i dont think anyones listening to you
i guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow
im strong
im strong woman
im gonna smoke the competition oh no its the babies
oh no i left disney+ on and it went to mulan
no because mulan is a female that identifies as male and yet the movie doesnt take the time to address real trans issues
well thank you pc principal um listen guys i just hope i can make you proud and more importantly i hope you can see that no matter who you are you can do anything weve really come a long way breaking down gender-binary bigotry and i hope i can especially inspire some of my girl students here
yes or those who identify as girls get out there and get involved in school sports and clubs if theres something you love dont ever let anything hold you back
oh yeah im ready david there are just so many amazing women athletes out here today it makes me so proud
amazing i feel honored to be a part of history i have a lot of incredible trans friends who are athletes and so were all inspired this woman is competing
uh no ive never competed against her before no
well what is an "average trans athlete" honestly i find that kind of bigoted david
uh good luck heather
yeah
just dont youll upset the pc babies
emory stop playing with your food
whats going on- oh hi heather
oh thats really cool im sorry but i have all the kids right now and theyre-
just dont youre gonna upset the pc babies
what do you mean
shes not getting to me
because i know her
its blade jaggart he - she - is my ex-boyfriend
back when we were together he was such an asshole when i finally broke up with him he said one day he was going to get me back and now hes got us both by the balls
he hates wome- she hates women when i left him he felt he got beat by a girl and nothing makes blade jaggart more crazy than getting beat by a girl
oh god what is he doing
are you just not gonna come home
p you cant just shut down because youre afraid of how the babies are gonna react
you know how they are theyre babies their minds are made up before anyone says anything
uh hey students as you know weve had some issues here at the school that were working very hard to correct so today we are honored to have a motivational speaker she is the current strong woman competition and also the champion in womens mma fighting and in womens wrestling please welcome the inspiring heather swanson
you sure youre ready for this
yes kids and look who else is here
they dont care they must see the nuance to this whole situation
and we didnt realize that our little babies are growing up
