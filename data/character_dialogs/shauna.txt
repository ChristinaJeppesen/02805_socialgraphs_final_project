okay mom
hi jimmy
thanks jimmy where are we going
you know that girl sally rauman at our school i cant stand her
really well kelligan bought the same purse and i was like "no way do i want it now" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have right and so-
i guess thats why i figured "who needs friends like that"
its like i told debbie "if youre gonna go out with my friends-"
"and so if youre gonna be that way i dont need to be your friend"
you know jimmy you are a great listener
yeah i mean no other boys really communicate like you do
what im not doing that
creep
