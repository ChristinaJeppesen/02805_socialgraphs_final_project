im afraid i have some bad news your son is suffering from multiple personality disorder
there are several distinct personalities going on in there one is named "postman butters" and yet another is "fireman butters" and then theres even "inspector butters" and uh "professor chaos"
from what i gather he seems to mostly jump in and out of personalities when hes outside playing sometimes hes a cowboy and other times hes an indian and the two seem to be at constant odds
no i dont think grounding him would do much good at this point what your son needs now is lots of tender loving medication heavy medication
