y-yes weve been able to trace the virus and confirm that it did in fact come from a seedy part of china
and in fact weve pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in wuhan
what we still dont understand is how did a transmitted disease get from a bat to a human how can a virus jump species like that we just dont know
yes now that we have the animal in our possession well finally be able to unlock what caused a virus to jump from it to humans
nono the virus did not come from a bat
we were able to break down the virus enough to see there was actually no bat involved
when we tracked the virus we found it did originate in wuhan but from a species called pholidota
its a pangolin and here it is right over here
aaand here it is this is the pangolin we tracked down in china the animal that could lead us to a vaccine the mysteries of covid can be unlocked by our studies of this creature ill just ask you all to keep a good distance away obviously we cant let anything happen to this pangolin you see this pangolins dna has mutated which is what we believe started it all
were not completely sure but we believe now that something somehow got its dna up into the pangolin
well i-its almost like another creature somehow inserted its dna up into the pangolin
again what really matters is that we decode the foreign dna inside the pangolin that would be the key to the vaccine perhaps even a cure we have to know what raped the pangolin
excuse me sir who are you this tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics are you a pandemic specialist
uh-kay anyway if you all follow me now to the micro labs i can show you the containment system for once a vaccine is able to be tried
yes you see what we needed was the foreign dna that was up inside the pangolin its whatever that dna was that was our key to the cure
now we have hope weve learned that we might never get back our old lives but by working together we just might find a new way to-
