your son is suffering from severe dementia he claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him this is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the childs past i think its best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests
all right butters just try to relax doin just fine butters just stay perfectly still now butters
good youre gonna feel a little pinch now butters dont worry mr stotch whatever traumatized your son in his past well find it
well after fourteen hours of testing i can say butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome you see butters when the brain wants to cover something up it makes up images and sounds for you to hear
good were making a lot of headway well do some more testing tomorrow all right folks lets let butters get some rest
