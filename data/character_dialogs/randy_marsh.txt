uuuh mayor im a geologist
well uh i dont study human biology i study the earth
wow
or else what
well lets see if they combust no could be from the no
not now stan i have to find out what causes spontaneous combustion or else
exactly
right
its in the attic with the old lps boys did you notice anything uuuh strange about kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion ooh what did he spend his time doing
new girlfriend
maybe nothing maybe everything
yes yes of course ive got work to do what
all right all right lets try it again kenny was standing here stan kyle and cartman were walking around him now walk do you feel hot
damn it how come youre not combusting
no has she been doing anything odd
boyfriend and they said kenny had a new girlfriend
no i think i might have it
mayor i have it i found out why people spontaneously combust
uh its too complicated to explain over the phone *girlfriend --> dead*boyfriend --> deadcall a town meeting tomorrow
wow
the little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend it wasnt the girl that caused him to combust it was the fact that kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her you see as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas
the methane gathers here in the bowel area where it causes pressure normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart should the gas not be expelled the methane can build up and then ignite leading to disaster kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long
exactly
i am i am huh i never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now
whoa hoho whoa oh wow oh ah im the best yeah yeah ah its just so amazing to be told that youre the best i i thought i was just a normal person like all of you but yeah well thank you for showing me otherwise yeah i kick ass yeah
you wanted to see me mayor
i suspect youre talking about the dramatic heat wave
mayor i think im a little overqualified for this my scientific mind is best used on global problems
ten thousand i have to protect my talent
dont worry mayor ill find the cause or else or else what exactly
not now stanley without my scientific genius the town is doomed lets see now when exactly did the temperature start to go up
stan
awww crap
well theyre right we should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere
hey
uuuh i- ill try to find a solution
mr garrison help me
i-i dont know what to say
stanley i think its best you live with kyle from now on his dad is better than me
hm really
not me im not a scientist im a hack even if i found a solution those people would still all hate me
what
youre right stanley youre absolutely right hey that bible sounds like kind of a good book
all right now lets get to work
wow
right right right
uh please everyone-
please just listen to me i think i found the answer
its all about moderation if you never fart you combust but if you always fart you deplete the ozone so we must fart only at appropriate times or when its really really funny
i know you all hate me but please for your own sake fart in moderation you can keep stoning me now if you want ow
no problem jakov
hey jakov uh could you run down to the store and get some more pretzels

oh shi-
oh uuhh look chef you know im-m not a racist but uh i just dont really feel strongly one way or another about the flag
no it does not sound nice stanley you are gonna have no part in that boy band
if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do that too
you are not gonna be in a boy band stanley and that is final
where is stan
what i specifically told him not to do that
and what if they do make it sharon what if they do make it are you gonna be the one to tell im
stanley what the hell are you doing
you get in the truck right now
get in the truck
stanley its just that theres better things you could be doing on a saturday than singing and dancing you could be watching tv or laying in bed
well theres plenty of other interesting you can do have you ever tried marijuana
well maybe its time
because i said so
let em be pissed off then
no nooo
i was i was 18 when my high-school mens choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in denver i was just one of fifteen members and i had no idea that a record producer was in the audience
producer
producer
producer
producer
producer
producer
and just like that i left everything i dropped out of high school
randy
i said good-bye to my girlfriend
randy
and i left my family
randy
and suddenly there i was thrown into a group with four other young men who i didnt even know
producer
the songs were terrible but believe it or not the country ate them up the next thing i knew we were the biggest thing in the world
ghetto avenue boys
i had everything a huge house and all the women you can imagine and then one day just as quick as it started
mr allens
mr allens
mr allens
mr allens
mr allens
they said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio so they towed my car
tow truck driver
the women all left
women
and they took back my house
randy
mr allens
the only thing i could do was come back to colorado and face everyone that i had abandoned
woman
and so you see stanley i do know what im talking about
i didnt want you to know because now im a joke ever since then ive wished every single day that i could go back to that moment when i was offered the job and say "no" because all the fame and the money the women all it did was build me up so that i could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world that is what being in a boy band is all about stanley its people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last nights pork chops now we wander the earth in disarray—us new kids on the block the osmonds were all the same and that is why you cant go to the mall
huh yeah
come here stanley stan it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why ive made some mistakes in my life and now i have to let you make your own mistakes
you know in a way i think i was even jealous of you being in a boy band isnt that stupid
well come on ill drive you down to the mall
yeah i wanna see what you guys can do and then well go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this
yeah i guess i still got it in me a little
well i think you boys are very smart for your age come on ill buy you all an orange smoothie
ey gerald maybe after the show we can make copies of each others tape so we have both
uh excuse me but my wife and i honestly never touched our child
that is the spirit of christmas commercialism because its what makes our country work
hey uh sam did you hear the news
yeah
oh sure i mean you know cop drama is a very artsy dramatic show
shipped he said "shipped"
ya know that words kind of getting old its not really funny anymore
really so we cant say fag
hey you didnt get beeped
i i cant follow this shitty storyline at all
that makes sense
well you boys must be pretty excited your first night of scouts
yeah both kennys dad and i were in scouts for years
alright boys were gonna head to the bar well be back to pick you up at nine
youre the new scout leader
he got to where he is by being a good scout maybe we should just leave him alone
so hes a homosexual so what
aw thats ridiculous
come on stanley
come on stan
what did you say
you do not say "big silly goose" you call him an asshole like a normal kid
stanley you call your friend an asshole this instant
thats better
nice to meet you
well i guess were off to the bar until nine then
wow you sure whipped those kids into shape
you bet
see ya mr grazier
oh no
oh god theyre actually pulling it off
oh my god
well weve all learned an important lesson that just because somebodys gay doesnt mean theyre gonna molest children straight people do that too
waaah
beating off the dog is not appropriate when we have company ah i mean ever beating off the dog is not appropriate ever
no stan what you were doing to the dog was-ss sexual
well you know when you do that to a m-male the eh eh you make his stuff come out well jesus havent they taught you these things at school
yeah lets get that damned school on the phone
what
hey sharon maybe you should stop watchin the news for a little bit shu-sharon youve been watching cnn for about ah eight weeks now dont you wanna watch somethin else shu-shu-sharon
stanley your mothers a little freaked out right now why dont you go play with your big brown package from afghanistan outside
hey sh- sharon ha- have you seen stan in the last couple days
oh okay
i dunno it was going so fast i couldnt see it but i want one
oh man it that the it
well yeah but i have one question about the way it works
well it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle
well so they dont really do anything
so then couldnt i just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth
hey uh sharon isnt that the williamses
yeah youd become what you hate
they dont think so stanley your your friend is terminally ill and that means well son th- that means hes going to be going to heaven soon
here he comes
yeah that has got to be about the biggest misunderstanding ever
well dont you see what this means its been 223 years so aids is finally funny
well our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately i think ever since their friend kenny died theyve been looking for someone to fill the void
they let you stay for free
sounds good to me lets go this weekend
oh do we have to do it right now
yeah and to be honest were just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal
so then its not really ours
listen uh its been thirty minutes wed like to go hit the slopes now
wait
all right look weve been here for over three hours
no no-no-no-no we we did your meeting and we did your lunch were finished okay
oh my god look how long the lift lines are
well this certainly is nice
oh god-damnit
no we dont want the super-secret fun prize alright we just wanna ski come on everybody
dont listen to em lets just go
lets just get out of here
that does it im calling the police
all the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting right and- and its been a day and a half these guys wont let us leave
oh jesus
yeah but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo so we all get to come to aspen for two weeks every year
stanley they belong to him
stan youre behaving like a kid
well we tried everything we cant get through the door without tearing apart the house
we gave those kids everything and they turned into little john walkers
what is that
what
jesus christ
vaginitis
a catholic boat trip
waaah waaah uyah ahem scuse me
look i just dont think its the best idea to let our boys to go on a c-cruise with the priests
with everything thats been in the news i think its best to keep our kids far away from the priests
it couldnt hurt
you know i think weve just had it with the church all the horrible things theyve done to kids i i think im gonna become an atheist
well uh lets lets just be atheists
yeah
stan youre an atheist now
oh boy now that were atheists we dont have to pray for our food
noho it doesnt work that way son
no it doesnt
honey honey come quick
well sharon and i are havin a great time bein atheist i for one cant believe i used to live my life by what a very old and very fictional book used to say
thats right i agree and it should be taken off of money as well the religious right in this country is trying to force our children to believe what they bel- bwwaaaagh and we cant let the religious right corrupt our kids
great news stan the vatican is burning down
hes right sharon we dont have to believe every word of the bible theyre just stories to help us to live by we shouldnt toss away the lessons of the bible just because some assholes in italy screwed it up
gang i think maybe we owe god an apology
no it means we get to son it means we get to
why whats the matter with him
ohhh boy looks like hes starting to notice breasts
hey there son
yes ahta lets have a talk stan
stan as you get older boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life
but stanley you cant let them get in the way of your friends there are a lot of boobs out there son but theyre just boobs your friends are forever
i know you think this set of boobs is important now but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs boobs will come and go and then someday youll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry and those become the boobs that matter the most
if you can just understand that stanley youll see that boobs hold no real power at all
well what are we gonna do mayor we have to stop these abductors from being able to get into our town
wait thats it a wall we could build a huge city wall all around south park so that we have complete control over who comes in
your ancestors put up a great wall that kept mongolians out for thousands of years we know you can do it for us
stan our abduction problems are over we got the new child tracker
if anybody takes you well be able to locate your exact location within two meters
there i think thats got it
you can barely even tell you have one on
there is no other team
dont worry itll still be fun for us
yeah and you kicked ass
here you go stanley this should hold you over for three years
the news says that at your age you arent safe with us son you have to get out of here before we abduct you
we cant tell you because we cant know where you are
good-bye kids well never forget you
whats the matter
oh im sure hes made it somewhere safe by now
sweetheart you saw the news
dont you worry im sure that stan and all the other kids are somewhere safe off in a whole new city by now making a new life for themselves
whats going on
what the hell are they doin here rabble rabble rabble
wait wait i learned some mongolian in college ah lets see uh k-kids uh bi kute bi salnek kute uh-d tah tasobarro
bi kute
staaan your name is staaan
thats it remember son rememmmber
no no you know who was right all along the mongolians they knew that you just cant wall yourself off from the outside world putting walls up never helps anything tearing them down brings us together
yes kids with us now come home hoomme
hey if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor
a ladder to heaven why son
thats the s-s-saddest thing ive ever heard
the boys wanna see their dead friend kenny again jimbo so theyre building a ladder to heaven
no its alright sheila the boys were just building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend kenny
well our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend kenny again and and that he thought it would work if he built the ladder to heaven
no agh look i i think maybe this has gone on far enough
boys its really neat that you want to see your old pal kenny so much but
when you die your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until youre nothing but ashes
the persons ashes are put into an urn and thats where kennys body is
what
oh god and we told our boys theyd never reach heaven
if saddam is building weapons we have to stop him with our weapons
wait are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy
no no we shouldnt bomb anybody these boys are right the only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth now we should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to create it
uh boys butters parents want to borrow the lord of the rings video we rented could you take it over to them
yeah whatever
hmmm that gets rid of them
yeah well uh the lord of the rings wasnt the only thing i rented from the video store i also rented a porno
you wanna go watch
you ready for some hot steamy fun
the guys at the office told me i had to rent this porno they said "this is without a doubt the hottest porno ever made"
i love that lingerie yeah you like that
yeeaahhh alright you ready
oh yeah
aw man i hate when pornos try to have a story
oh yeah
yeah it almost looks like the lord of the-- oh my god this is lord of the rings
the boys have the hottest porno ever made
calm down maybe the boys havent gotten there yet
boys boys wheres the videotape
well wait a minute uhhh boys do you think you can go get that tape back for us really fast
yes it is it is more important than anything ive ever asked you to do you must retrieve the tape but do not look at it uh for it holds an evil power retrieve the tape and return it to us at home do this and you will be greatly rewarded
okay problem solved
uh chris are the boys over here
we well this is really sort of funny but uh we we accidentally put aporno in the lord of the rings box
the boys mustve come and saw what it was and then taken it away somewhere
and so thats the situation all the boys are out there somewhere with a pornographic videotape
im afraid it was backdoor sluts 9
it-it cant hurt em that much can it
we think our boys might be showing other children a uh pornographic tape
yes uh you see tolkien that was called a pornographic film i-it shows adult men and adult women having sexual intercourse well y-you see when a when a man and a woman fall in love the man puts his penis in the womans vagina its called love-making and its part of being in love
jimmy jimmy where did the boys go with the porno tape
the video sandwich
whats a video stockyard jimmy
i know where it is
boys boys
there you are
a-alright now now listen kids theres some things we need to put into context for you you see a man puts his penis into a womans vagina for both love and pleasure but sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each others genitals in their mouths uh this is called "69ing" and its normal
thats right its something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting
going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it
well lets all get going
well i think in the fourth chapter when uh nancy drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleaders locker well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage
aw im surprised at you stanley i really thought you knew how to accept people for who they were
no buts stanley were not raising our kids to be discriminators
ah heres the arab as a terrorist
ah heres a good one its the stereotypical "sleepy mexican"
oh im sorry i thought you were a wax sculpture
thats our cartman
now do you see why tolerance is so important boys
well i really thought you boys learned something in the museum of tolerance but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers
oh my god
hes right our boys didnt hate homosexuals they just hated the way this asshole was acting
were sorry boys why didnt you tell us your teachers were acting so over-the-top
who is it sharon
dad look we dont know you and you dont know us just go away before we call the police
okay weve had enough
i dont know
how could he possibly know all that unless he is our son from the future
stan whatevers happened we going to help you
i think hes pretty scared alright
well i think when this is all over our son is gonna thank us
yeah stan dont be so hard on yourself

stan stan oh okay uh you you might be wondering why butters has a future self too
oh well son weve just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are
well stan the truth is marijuana probably isnt gonna make you kill people and it most likely isnt gonna fund terrorists but well son pot makes you feel fine with being bored and its when youre bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you arent good at anything

ladies and gentlemen if global warming has in fact already caused the beaverton flood then this is only the beginning the effects are going to spread what we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which weve never seen

you go outside and youll die by now the global warming has shifted the climate bringing on a new ice age within the hour the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero
all we can do is try to wait it out as long as we can
everyone below this line will have to be evacuated to the south everyone above this line is already dead people like us in the middle states have to ride it out the balmy southwestern states might have a chance but new york will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast what frank aw awww goddammit

and that too stop talking with your eyes closed thats what smug people do
there like that stop that
i know its like "earth to america hello this is simple stuff here gawl"
at least were smart enough to know better
are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all
yeah good going stupid
hey where do you think youre going
oh no youre not your gay little song got us to drive hybrids youre gonna help us get rid of em
thats it thats that the last one
im sorry stan im sorry your gay little song killed your friend
yeah first off were all gonna need new cars
you mean drive in hybrids but not act like were better than everyone else because of it

oh naggers of course naggers right
well gave it my best shot least we had a fun trip huh gang
wha well what was i supposed to do sharon i thought i was gonna make $30000 stanley the only reason daddy used that word is that he thought he would win money
i want to apologize deeply and sincerely for using the n-word on wheel of fortune and i want to assure you that i am not a racist reverend jackson
uh well like anybody else thought it was "naggers" i mean right
oh ah i will im really down with african-americans
y-yes absolutely
hahh thank you mr jackson thank you

agh oh okay ill ahh lets see here uh
ooh an african-american performer at the comedy club
yeah no problem
i just need some aspirin
fine
words with venom words that bind words used like weapons to cloud my mind im a person im a man but no matter how i try people just say "hey theres that ni**er guy" everywhere i go its always the same everyone just thinks of me as that one single name "hey ni**er guy ni**er guy hi ni**er guy" stop now go call me ni**er guy fill me with your hate try to bring me down- oop up youre too late when will it end will there ever be a time when i can be thought of as more than just "ni**er guy" respect
and so it is my honor to announce today the randy marsh african-american scholarship foundation it is my hope that this foundation will prove my commitment to the education of african-american students and erase once and for all my identity as the "ni**er" guy you really you really dont know how hard it is to be constantly reminded of something lame that happened in your past i mean i just wanna move on from what happened on "wheel of fortune" you know and and when people call me "ni**er guy" theyre bringing up a painful chapter of my history and all the negativity that went along with it you just you cant imagine how that feels
anyway heres to a new start for us all thank you
awww awwww
whoa
please i i dont want any trouble
what do you want
whats going on here
no no no im sorry but im not like you i just said the n-word by mistake to win money
you said the n-word to a black mans face thats way worse than what i did
no
senators i know it is not normally considered "american" to ban words but there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal im talking of course about the term "ni**er guy"
two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together form a verbal missile of hate
oh sure some people just use the term in jest - tell a ni**er guy joke or two thinking its no big deal - but they dont realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence
senators ive learned to admit that im capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while can anybody say they never do how long will it be before you are all called "ni**er guys"
we did it
in my easter bonnet with all the frills upon it ill be the grandest lady in the easter parade
look at that one huh half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker im good

we have to be careful when we think somebodys onto us we are all part of a secret society stan a very ancient very important society of men who follow the way of the rabbit and protect the secret of the easter bunny we are called the hare club for men
duh its the hare club for men chicks wouldnt understand
i belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years our identities have to be protected
stan you dont seem to understand how serious this is the secret of easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world
i cant tell you you have to be allowed into the society first but but perhaps its time
i always knew this day would come when my son would be brought into the society reminds me of the day i was brought in by my father
of course marshes have been in the hare club for men for generations all the way back to the beginning
you arent a member yet you cant know where our secret meetings take place were going to a distant location an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away
dammit
are you sure son once you hear the secret you will be bound to the hare club for men forever

jesus its statewide
jesus were all alone
i dont know i need to get on web md and see why i have this cough but i cant
hey shelly whoa stop stop
youre right we cant just sit here any longer
were gonna head west theres a rumor goin around there might be some internet out there so were headed out californee way
well there certainly aint none here look maybe its time you all face reality the internet here is dried up
yeah and maybe it wont in the meantime i got a family who needs the internet right away well head out californee way and see what we can find come on lets go
how you wont have internet
know anywhere else we can stay were heading out californee way looking for some internet
im goin down the road feelin badim goin down the road feelin badim goin down the road feelin bad oh lordymy internet done up and went away

thats right we need to get online
come on stan lets get some rest
everyone wake up were here silicon valley californee
do they have internet here
marsh
netzero
so is there internet here
excuse me were looking for some internet
forty seconds that aint even long enough to check wikipedia
awww how am i supposed to see internet porn that way
uh you go ahead sharon divide some internet amongst the children i- gotta talk to somebody
excuse me i need to uh have some private internet time
i havent jacked off in over two weeks
you dont understand i need the internet to jack off i got used to being able to see anything at the click of a button you know once you jack off to japanese girls puking in each others mouths you cant exactly go back to playboy
three minutes would be plenty
ohhh
yeah howd you know
i know right
"internet porn simulator"
uh japanese girls exchanging bodily fluids click oh this sucks i cant jack off to this damn it uhm lets see interracial gangbang click agh les-shemales lets try shemales click bestiality click click on that ah ah brazilian fart fetish porn click click dahya no no this isnt gonna work its just not the same
well at least that parts like the internet
uhuh finally im online again yeeheeyes japanese girls puking each others mouths
oh niice whoa
now lets see some bestiality aahahaha yes ogh lets get some brazilian fart porn in there oh thats good eh oh ohhhhhhhhh hoh hohhh
ohhhhhhhhhh ohhhhhhhhhh
ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhh
oh uhh there was a there was a ghost a-a-and-this this ectoplasm did you see the ghost it ran through here it sli-it slimed me
oh no it wasnt me it was this spooky ghost
and so what have we learned through this ordeal the internet went away it came back but for how long we do not know we cannot take the internet for granted any longer we as a country must stop over-logging -on we must use the internet only when we need it its easy for us to think we can just use up all the internet we want but if we dont treat the internet with the respect that it deserves it could one day be gone forever so let us learn to live with the internet not for it no more browsing for no apparent reason no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television and finally we must learn to only use the internet for porn twice a day max

stan now more than ever you need to understand the importance of saving money
go on stanley
hey im trying to teach my son the importance of savings you already lost his money
aw jesus christ sliced hot dogs and tomato slices
ill tell you what happened son see theres a bunch of idiots out there who werent happy with what they had they wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didnt even need-- people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying and these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing cause they thought money was endless it goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in america deserves to own a house so we have people having a hard time paying their loans meaning less money coming in and the idiots couldnt see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the economy and they made the economy very angry were all feeling the economys vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money do you understand son
there are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person but the fault lies in all of you you who bought that three hundred thousand dollar house when you only had twenty thousand to put down you who bought that third car even though only two people in your home drive it is time to stop pointing fingers finger pointing gets us nowhere steve we have mocked our economy and now the economy has cast its vengeance upon us all
yea it is an angry and unforgiving economy to repent we must stop frivolous spending instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds instead of buying clothes wear but sheets from thine beds cut spending to only the bare essentials water and bread and margaritas yea
we have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the economy there are those who will say that the economy has forsaken us nay you have forsaken the economy and now you know the economys wrath o thoust can shop at a sporting goods store but knowest thou that the economy will take away thy broncos cap from thine head mock the economy without fear thine own stockbrokers now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the economy well here we are my friends you have brought the economys vengeance upon yourselves
we must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent instead of cars that take gasoline we can get around on llamas from drakes farm instead of video games that take batteries and software our kids will play with squirrels we must let the economy know that we are capable of respecting it no more needless spending the economy is our shepherd we shall not want
i am pretty smart yea but i have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan
then perhaps soon our economy will return to us
what
relax father maxi what harm can one jew do against our economic recovery movement
weve done everything we can and yet the economy has not improved worse it has declined poor bart here just lost his job at little caesars pizza our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one jew why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the economy
that is stupid yea and going around telling people to shop is dangerous
what is this whats going on
whats he doing
but thats impossible why would he do this
uh theres about seventeen thousand dollars worth here
wow the new margaritaville with salsa dispenser "just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom" oh we need this
oh my god well how is he doing yeah yeah im sure huh okay well thank you for telling me mr stotch ill spread the word yoeah you take care bye we need to cancel our plans sharon theres gonna be an emergency all-parent meeting at the school tonight

there is no support every ally america ever had is wait a minute sometimes when a threat is great enough you have to turn to your enemies for help
we could ask al qaeda
maybe its time we put our differences aside and forgive them
people from jersey

that thing is famous why
dont let it get away where is it who was that
hello mr bin laden my name is randy and im a geologist in america i know that america isnt your favorite place in the world but gosh darn it we need your help as you may know we are trying to stop our entire country from becoming new jersey i believe that if we do not succeed jersey will spread to japan russia and eventually to you i know you have seen countless horrors in your lifetime mr bin laden and that you have witnesses the very worst of mankind well now i ask you to watch this

on a cold october night a small town in colorado stood up to new jersey and finally said "go away" our fortitude was the inspiration for others and now new jersey is slowly receding back to the desolate land from whence it came our countrys getting back to normal and we owe it all to osama bin laden

ill get my old job back tomorrow cookings dumb im just really sleepy love you sharon
oh dear
did they measure from the base or from the balls
im a scientist i think its best i handle this
hello students my name is dr marsh and im gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday how do a man and a woman make a baby anybody a man and woman what do they do to make a baby how about the little girl in the brown coat yeah you
good the man puts his penis okay into the womans vagina okay now sometimes a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important but is it when you boys measure your penis length the truth is it doesnt really matter what does matter is length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared okay when were talking about penis size we cant just use a tape measure we need a scale and a protractor as well lets look at it on the graph here follow along with me on your study sheets kids
and so by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the- what do we call it again the yaw the yaw of the shaft what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or tmi any questions so far yes little girl over there
ah good question ahh the penis is the thing were talking about that boys have that were measuring okay any other questions okay so then lets move on to the example on your study sheet how about you could you read the first example for the class example 1 young lady please read the problem out loud
four point four inches
seven centimeters
great and so divide by the 17 carry the 1 and we can see that randys adjusted penis size or tmi is 63 inches do we got that randys length is 44 inches but his adjusted length is 63 so how does our example person "randy" compare to others on the tmi scale by referring again to the tmi chart we see that a tmi of 63 is 8 inches more than the national average
putain dmenteur

and after "lion king" in new york "godspell" "mamma mia"
broadway shows sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs im so sorry sharon
no theyre theyre bros sharon stephen sondheim elton john andrew lloyd webber theyre total bros who hang out at hooters sharon im so sorry

yes stan this is what people want dont worry you look really cool
oh you know try to get it into the end zone but be really polite about it
hows it going awesome nobodys getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about
happy im thrilled look at how much better this is
oh this is good nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball yeah yeah were were through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled lets make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide go on pat yourselves on the back

member berries

member berry pie okay i love member berries
wait a minute
yeah i have some questions about uh member berries
oh my god theres this many
gerald hey come on in youre not alone bud were all facing the same struggles and trying to do something about it anyways please continue richard
its okay man youre not alone
and thats how we got here to this very memberberry election
what have been your struggles with memberberries gerald
michael are there memberberries in your pocket
anyway gerald what has your experience been
\they mr garrison come on in bud have a seat youre not alone
no lynchings here little cowboy take a seat you wanna share with us what youre goin through
its not your fault little guy
\tnot your fault
youve gotta stop blaming yourself
here catch
that is why millions of americans want you to be president but theres more
every great empire reaches a point where going backward can seem more appealing than forward when the world is changing so fast it makes us yearn for the old ways when life seemed simpler but it doesnt mean those old ideas are good for us now we have to face one hard reality as a country the new star wars was not as good as everyone thought it was it may seem fun to go back and recycle the past we loved but we end up with no sustenance
well thats important too i guess but its just a symptom of the same thing see when a civilization has become so big it starts to get lazy then thats when you get member berries theyre noting new they date back all the way to the roman empire once too many romans ate the member berries there was no more growth they rested on their laurels just eating and membering all the good stuff
thought so too till i zoomed in
you see we all wanna go back to when we were kids simple ideas like a big man to protect us keep us safe instead of a fresh new star wars we want the old just recycled and plopped in our tummies
does this look familiar
thats much easier said than done theyre resistent to just about everything i tried
uh there has to be something
damn it these things are impossible to get rid of
damn it nothing kills these things
theyre not in the jar thats it look its over
its over dont you get it even if weve found a way to eradicate them now we dont have time to implement it nation-wide
theres no other choice mr garrison the american people have to be made to understand whats going on here youre gonna have to talk to them
for the first time ever youre gonna have to speak from the heart not make it about you
you know what these things are capable of even if you lose the election another one like you is gonna rise up and take your place jj abrams is seeing to that
all i know is that for the future of our country youre gonna have to give one last speech the speech that everyone needs to hear a speech where you finally just talk like a normal human being
what have you done you maniacs
this isnt how it was supposed to happen
garrison garrison what the fuck have you done where is he
yeah ill say he has do you have any idea what youve done to our country
you admitted you didnt know how to run a country you agree people were supporting you just because they like the new star wars and you begged me to help you lose
no it wasnt something else has to have happened
theres nothing great about rehashing all the old star wars moments into a new- ah aaah aaaaaah aaah i i suppose i suppose i can watch it one more time give it another chance
well i dont know about you guys but i sure am excited america is going to be great again arent you excited gang
aww come on shelly weve learned that women can be anything except for president
have you really watched it sharon it has more to offer than just nostalgia lets all watch it again tonight

youre right youre right its only now when everyone is being so indigenous to me that i realized how indigenous ive been acting all along i thought being a victim would solve all my problems but being a victim has a down side too mr galtman i havent been honest its time for us all to be honest
what is a holiday its a day off work yes a day off school but holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect today im happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off but instead of glorifying anyone let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel say what were really thinking so we can move on and so the second monday in october will still be a holiday but instead of columbus day it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down and we will call it indigenous peoples day for perhaps if we all do it at the same time we wont be so indigenous the rest of the year and since this is the second monday of october lets all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now
thats the spirit dave come on everybody lets just all be totally indigenous come on
good one kurt your wifes a whore come on everyone indigenous peoples day lets go for it

some people like their weed made the old-fashioned way here at tegridy we believe weed is about people over the past few months tegridy has expanded from the simple farmhouse you see behind me to actually owning the entire 420 valley and i think youll see on this tour that even though our business has grown we just kept our weed simple it takes over a thousand plants to make just one box of tegridy weed theres juan carlos over there hes one of our newest employees mornin juan carlos what happens when you combine science with tegridy a lot of magic here you can see our latest growing methods along with our science center and of course it wouldnt be colorado weed without our rocky mountain high tasting room feel free to come back here later and try all our tegridy products well folks we hope you enjoyed your tour theres a lot to buy here in the gift shop and please do remember your tour guides work on tips lets give me a big hand

yes towelie im working on a merger with med men
we have a deal in the works to help each other put a stop to home-growers once and for all
thats because im the president of the company and you are a towel

best towel you ever had bitch
stan family meeting get downstairs
nobody cares about that come on ive got big news sharon shelly hurry ive got it
you guys ive just had the greatest idea ever
no ive been trying to figure out how to make more money selling weed and last night it came to me we could grow the family business by selling tegridy to the chinese i did a little research turns out theres a lot of people in china if we can get like 2% of that market to buy our weed wed make millions and millions of dollars im flying to china tomorrow ive got to get in on this before anyone else thinks of it
whats this saturday
everyone stan you need to wear your tegridy t-shirt at the performance
stan theyre available on amazon starting friday so you could really help promote the family business while im gone but then again i guess family doesnt mean all that much to you
first time goin to china
its my first time im goin out to try and drum up a little "business" what are you headin out for
ohhh huhuh heeeyy fuck you
i i had that idea like three days ago
so when did you come up with it
oh for christs sake you have a good idea and everyone wants to copy you fine i can handle some healthy competition who else wants to go to china and get some of their money oh for cryin out loud let me guess you work for a company trying to get chinese people as customers "wow whered you get that idea" its okay its okay im sure theres plenty of chinese people for all of us
hello howdy im a small business owner from the united states you guys know any money people here can i give you guys my card im just starting to grow my business here in china
oh that thats weed marijuana you know
ah here here we go jay shi daamaa tegridy weed whoa oh hey everything alright whats going on uh hey don-dont forget my suitcase c-could you grab my suitcase all my weed is in there excuse me jay shi daamaa
aaaugh i am a proud member of the communist party the party is more important than the individual
who whos there
no i dont have any honey are you prisoners here
jesus what kind of madhouse is this
your honors im just a simple farmer from a simpler time now ive never been to china before but i hate to say im a little disappointed in all of you from what ive seen you seem to treat your people like dirt you dont believe in any individual freedoms i mean you got winnie the pooh and piglet in jail now come on china you know a country aint nothin unless its got decency and in-tegrity and i think i speak for pooh and piglet and all of disney when i say you could use some tegrity china now it just so happens that i own a tegridy farm and i think i might be able to work out a deal for all you nice folk
uhhh thats me randy marsh
no im from south park
hey hold on a minute do you really think this business should be run through intimidation and fear whatever happened to old-time values you already have business with the chinese you have all the connections money can buy but theres one thing you dont have thats tegridy now it just so happens-
they didnt listen at all but i wuh-why not
but for what
what if we took their side then what if we showed china that we understand how they feel to be made fun of on the internet
well gang looks like the family business is starting to really turn the corner i dont know about you but i for one think the world is gonna be a better and safer place now that china finally has tegridy
winnie the pooh winnie the pooh- oh yeah i did kill winnie the pooh where are ya goin stan
ooo about me make sure it talks about me bringing tegridy to china
good morning everyone morning so listen guys we are not in good shape the whole "doing business in china" thing has sort of bitten us in the ass and now we arent selling enough weed to keep up with our costs you see this this right here thats us plateauing we no longer get any of that sweet chinese money and now all the money we do make doesnt even cover our expenses so how do we sell more weed stan
not good enough shelly
nice attitude how do we sell more weed sharon
right cut out all our marketing thats sharons great idea everyone towelie

eating meat doesnt just hurt animals it hurts people it takes 13 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of animal meat all that plant food could be used much more efficiently if-m if people just ate it directly meat is also not environmentally friendly meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution and the meat industry is one of the biggest huh oh i was just saying that adopting a vegan diet is way more effective than switching to a greener car in the fight against climate change for your health for our planet for the animals and for each other we have to switch to plant-based foods now it just so happens-

hey good morning everybody welcome to tegridy breakfast the show where we talk about everything tegridy farms im randy marsh
today were gonna talk about whats been growing on the farm especially our new tegridy thanksgiving special
guh uh go where
what the hell are you do- sorry everybody well be right back
what do you think youre- my show my tegridy farms show
hello mayor mr and mrs tweek mackey
yah mexican joker that was terrible
well thats ridiculous
guys i have nothing against homegrowers
hm hmmm
enough of tegridy farms south park is nothing without tegridy farms
i didnt do anything wrong you people are just jealous jealous that i took over south park and im successful
hi mr ga- mr president uh im really sorry to bother you look uh im in a bit of trouble
yeah they uh someone got some supposed evidence on me doing something "illegal" and uh
y-yeah of course
did i what
uh uhm "hey you you blew up peoples yards who were growing their own marijuana"
"you you illegally damaged property and made your business-"
jeez youre really good at that look what i really need from you is some personnel do you know any good lawyers
look doctor you have to give me something im really sick
im like starting to question things that ive done like starting to question the person ive become and i cant sleep at night i i just lay in my cell wondering if ive been a bad father lately and a bad husband and please it really hurts i need some marijuana
i just need a little medicinal weed and these symptoms will all go away
you need to turn your life around clearly you have the addiction problem and im just your whipping boy
ahh poop
ive had a lot of time to just sit in here and think im starting to realize i have this pattern of behavior where i always want more more weed more drinks more deals with the chinese its never enough see ive always had my flaws but at the end of the day i cared about people you know what the president said he said just deny everything and make yourself the victim yeah well maybe hes part of how i got here maybe the president has brought down my moral meter i dont mean to cast blame - im to blame - but ever since he was elected ive compared my morals to his and no matter how awful i am im never as bad a the president so im okay
i do
oh thanks but i think im just gonna plead guilty
oh ohhh
yeahhh
yeah i have some words to say
i cant believe im being attacked here you people are monsters the evidence shows me in a yard taking a dump yes because i was setting a trap for mexican joker thats right and mexican joker attacked seconds later i was trying to protect you people from terrorists and what do i get for it i get a- a bunch of- a bunch of no no i cant do this you wanna know what really happened the president sent me his lawyer and his lawyer told me what to say to get off and gave me a joint in prison
and then i smoked that joint and you know what i thought i thought "this is some shitty-ass weed" it wasnt tegridy it barely even changed my mental state the reason i got into the marijuana business was to make quality simple weed that came from the heart weed that was strong and pure somewhere on that journey i lost my way tegridy weed is about community its a sunrise its the smile on a baby but most of all tegridy weed is about family i had forgotten i have a loving wife and son and im not gonna forget them anymore so im not gonna fight this ill do my time and maybe someday ill be back making marijuana thats simple marijuana thats tegridy because when you do the right thing good things happen
thank you it feels really good to have these charges dropped now we can all get back to the business of trying to heal id like to would you please get the fuck away from me id like to take this opportunity to thank those who have always been by my side supporting me from the very beginning the people who stood by me since day one and gave me hope the whites thanks for having my back mr and mrs white and now everybody if you dont mind ive got a farm to tend to
well gang i guess thats about it huh its been a really good run but looks like the season is over
well sure the first snow is falling crops are pretty much dead well whatd you all think huh i think the season was a little better than anyone expected i really wanna thank you guys for a great run and hey we hope you all enjoyed the season too it had a little bit of everything didnt it and hopefully the season finale really brought it all home of course if you havent had a chance to try the season finale yet it is available now for a special price this limited-edition weed made from the very last crop of the season is pricey but worth it
hello mayor everybody what are you doing here
for what
guys my season is over tegridy farms season ended weeks ago
you want me to do a christmas special
but guys look behind you the crops are dead how am i supposed to sell weed to people now
tegridy
well youre right about that let me call my marijuana science specialist and ill see what i can do
so we use the greenhouse theres gotta be a way to make a christmas special its what everyone wants
thats cause people really didnt like mexican joker im not gonna just repackage it thats not special
nagh
its just it needs something else just mixing old product together and naming it something new thats not special and its not tegridy its just not tegridy its gonna be your birthday soon jesus i wanna make something as special as you are i just need the right idea
well howdy there folks
heard you were all a little down and might need a boost so i thought id bring you some christmas snow whoa whoa theres enough for everybody
just a little somethin extra for a special kick
oh hi mayor
whats going on are people not liking the christmas special so far
okay okay look you busted us its a mix of different strains of marijuana we had left over from last season i know its wrong
oh that thats cocaine
yeah i got the idea praying to christ you know powder snow its what gives christmas snow its kick getting enough cocaine was the tricky part so we started growing our own turns out the coca plant is even hardier than the marijuana plant it can grow even when were out of season
it is
hey hey its not a big deal ive been through this before hang on ill handle it dont go anywhere
legalize it legalize it
okay cocaines totally legal now
yeah legal in seven states including this one and other states are soon to follow i told you its 2019 dawg
our christmas special is so amazing i dont know how were gonna keep up with all the demand
we need more help were never gonna get enough done in time hey shelley hey shelley hey shelley
hey shelley can you help us make more labels for our christmas special
oh great my daughter had a marijuana problem and now she has a problem with cocaine ah must be more customers what the hell is this
heheey fuck you who has that kind of power
we cant sell marijuana during the holidays
we cant give up on the christmas special people need it i think i know a way around this
there you are maam there you are sir this is amazing towelie tegridy farms is finally gonna make all the money i ever dreamed of
hold on tight towelie we have to save christmas
o-ho ohhhhh
hey santa we need to talk
santa you dont understand
santa thats not just cocaine its tegridy cocaine
thats not true this cocaine is grown locally by local people please just try it

because its grown here on a farm its not cut with any nasty chemicals or harmful impurities
please jesus
its tegridy
hey guys im so happy my christmas special turned out okay
hey everybody can everyone hear me okay thanks for turning out everyone you know weve all been through a lot these past several months weve shut down and people have lost their businesses lost their livelihoods i also own a small business i sell weed and i have to say im actually doing pretty good amazing tegridy farms weed has seen a 400% increase in sales since the shutdown in march i see thomas turner out there thomas opened a restaurant in sodosopa doesnt seem like such a good idea now does it turner and theres marley jarvis who owned and operated her own tanning salon whoops but i just cant stand here and gloat because tegridy weed is about giving back to people and thats very proud to announce that tegridy weed is having a pandemic special and all-new hybrid of our best weed sold at nearly 10% off our usual price not only that but when you buy three pounds or more of the pandemic special you get a complimentary pandemic 2020 bong we are a community lets all be together with tegridy

lets go weed wew
boycotting what wait what
ugh ahhug–
guys i wanna have kind of a tough talk with you we dont really have any black friends we dont reach out to the black community shelley you never bring any black dudes over i mean stan your three best friends are all white
yes that kid token how come you never hang out with him
in a group maybe but i dont recall just you and token ever doing anything ive never seen token here at the farm just like the two of you guys why not
wed like to think that wouldnt we but actions speak louder than words gang i guess i guess i just want you to think about it
ok there we go this is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at tegridy alright come on everybody dig in
well you know with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together if theyre friends then we need to be friends huh do you mind if i post this check out our friends
w-what are you talking about
oh thats so lame no we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since stan is friends with token you know just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that
well– i mean its just kind of an odd name isnt it like some people might think you guys naming your son that isnt very cool
well i mean other people just think its a little i mean come on i mean im– im not calling you guys racist but– why did you name your son that
his name is tolkien
holy shit thats what his name means
would you like to see how we grow and process our weed
you see its all about refinement here at tegridy we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks oh real quick it all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell so what do you think
yeah it takes a lot you know– i just had a crazy idea our boys are best friends now why dont you come work for tegridy
oh my gosh– i was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting look i would it be okay if if i sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult
oh my god this is amazing heres to the start of something wonderful would you like some free weed
taking shit tons of tegridy orders sales are going nuts right now
because we work together
yes but then– you got promoted i was gonna surprise you dont you see how lucrative this can be i mean we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business i mean we are ben and jerry– were ben and jerry youre jerry and im ben

lets sell what we can from our drive up booth and then later we can hit the irish bar what the fuck hey excuse me
what do you think youre doing

is that right okay game on motherfucker
oh uh a very happy mornin everybody and a foine st patricks day to all of ye i dont know if ya noohticed but uh theres a farm across the street selling weed also and the owner is actually 10 par-cent irish
what im upset about is a wee little thing called "cultural appropriation" ever heard of it thats why we cant wear sombreros on cinco de mayo why we cant dress like indians on halloween
im looking at my point you racist son of a bitch you have no right to wear that stuff it is offensive come on guys st patricks day is the one day of the year we have left where we can actually celebrate being white any other day that we tried to be proud of our culture we would get immediately cancelled by twitter and yet for some reason youre all over here buying your weed from someone who is fine mocking our customs and traditions
okay yeah yeah lets arrest the white leprechaun cuz you know cant have one day for a mostly white culture right dont wanna get cancelled i guess dont arrest him for cultural appropriations guess guess that only works one way huh
yeah yeah you dont have to push me copper
i want my phone call
yeah im a real fucking leprechaun
hell yeah were gonna bust outta here what do you have planned
uh yes this is randy marsh ive been incarcerated i need to speak with my attorney
yes i am aware of that listen to me carefully the canary is in the cage
oh a confidential matter lawyer client privilege uh you know theres an officer standing right here actually oh oh its okay hes stepping away stan they got me locked up youre gonna have to help me break outta here we have to stop them
listen to me is your friend tolkien there
yeah well his piece a shit dad is trying to take over the st patricks day special
you better care because if we dont make money today you and sister are gonna starve do you understand and i wont be able to pay the wi-fi bill
i need you to leave school go home and get a jar of the st patricks day special weed and sneak it into the police station
im asking you to do one little thing ditch school get weed sneak into the police station do it or no more wi-fi i mean it piece a shit lawyer
wha wha whats happening whats happening
i told you to bring me weed not a cake
you dont fucking listen to me do you youre incapable of ever doing anything right because-- oh a cake gooot it thank you very much
its simple theres always cops looking to make a score you just gotta find the one willing to trade some drugs for a favor and once they get a whiff of my st patricks day special they wont be able to resist oh oh man that is strong
white people were slaves in history nuh-uh gah its such a good special its just such a shame people are trying to ruin it hey my bruthuh you got a second
you dont wanna miss out on the only white holiday still allowed do ya howd you like to be able to uh celebrate a little
no
thats it its over my plan is done
me golden coins of spite
towelie where is all the st patricks day special
the weeds all gone does that mean you were able to sell it
what
so you mean that right now everyone down at the irish bar is enjoying my special and they dont even know it
come on lets go
stop right there you piece a shit is everyone enjoying the special
oh yes so did a lot of people but you see theres just one thing wrong this isnt credigree weeds special its moine
you see this is what happens when you appropriate a culture its sort of your special and its sort of not your special and nobody knows whose special it is
no no no no no no you dont get to say what you learned cause its not your special this holiday is about tegridy
whoa-a-a
