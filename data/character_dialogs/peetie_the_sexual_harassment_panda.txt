hello everyone im peetie the "dont sue people" panda
listen to me when you sue somebody it hurts everyone you sue for money but where do you think that money comes from from the schools from taxes from the state from you theres no such thing as free money when you sue somebody you take money away from parks and schools and charities and put it in your own pocket and that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda
"dont sue people" panda
pandas love ice cream
hello cubs im "dont sue people" panda with an important message for you lawsuits damage our society i know its tempting to make money but just remember that money has to come from somewhere and usually it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people so until next time dont let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools good-bye now
