what
is that what happened to the adults here you lied to the police and said they molested you my god they were your parents
the birth-givers your birth-givers dont you remember they are your providers not some statue and theyre not up in some fantastical faraway land now theyre in prison probably crying themselves to sleep cold and lonely and im sure missing you all very very much your birth-givers took care of you thats what their laws and their rules were for because they love you and they didnt want you to end up living like th-this he wont take care of you your parents your providers will
if you want things to be the way they were in the before time in the long long ago you all need to call the police and tell them you lied about them m word
