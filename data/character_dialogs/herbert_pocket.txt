pray come in
as do you perhaps weve seen each other before as to our lodging its not by any means splendid this is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth this is my little room - rather musty and this is your bedroom
oh what a gay time we shall have and i do mean gay as in festive not as in penetration of the bum oh but dear me i beg your pardon youre holding your bags all this time pray let me take them im quite ashamed
why yes of course youre the prowling little boy boy what a smashing coincidence
that old biddy oh i assure you i have nothing to do with her anymore shes absolutely mad
well dont you know about ms havishams melancholy past dear me its quite a story and should be discussed over dinner come right time for a smashing meal and the story of ms havisham
youll do fine dear fellow just fine now on to ms havisham she was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat and now i might mention pip that in london it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth
not at all im sure anyway ms havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady and soon a man came along which gets me to the cruel part of the story merely breaking off pip to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler
not at all im sure so this man pursued ms havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her she passionately loved him back the marriage day was fixed the wedding dress was bought the wedding guests were all invited and finally the day came but not the groom and i break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table
not at all im sure so the groom never showed he simply wrote a letter a letter that ms havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding
but afterward she laid waste to the entire house as you have seen it and has never since looked upon the light of day and the story ends pip with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table
not at all im sure
joe found you lying face down in the street mr pip you were in such a state youve been unconscious here for nearly three hours
i tried to tell you pip shes a vengeful spiteful woman who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex
righto pip righto
dear god pip look
righto pip
hello gentlemen oh whatever you do please do not cry havishams device fuels itself on your tears im afraid
yes but just think about panda bears oh theyre so cuddly and sweet panda bears are what silly little noses they have
oh right right lets not think about panda bears then lets think about swimming oh what jolly fun swimming is with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive
oh what fun it is to collect stamps lick the backs put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors
right lets not talk about stamp-collecting then lets talk about
oh what fun ice-skating is who can catch me who can catch the ice-skating king thats me
please sirs you must not cry
philip its too late
ooooo top smart pip
oh im so glad everything has worked out where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then pip
