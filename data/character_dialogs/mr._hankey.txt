howdy-ho chef
whats all the ruckus
i reckon this could be a job for mr hankey
stop fighting
come on gang dont fight you people focus so hard on the things wrong with christmas that youve forgotten whats so right about it dont you see this is the one time of year were sposed to forget all the bad stuff to stop worrying and being sad about the state of the world and for just one day say "aw the heck with it lets sing and dance and bake cookies"
howdy-ho kyle
i brought some friends with me
well ive got a loong night ahead of me bye-bye and merry christmas
ky-yle ky-yle
hooowwwdy ho
ky-yle
ky-yle
hooowwwdy ho
howdy-ho boys
gosh look at yuh youre all growin up sho fasht
have you all been brushing behind your teeth
and usin dental floss
and washin behind your ears
oh i just got a little cold is all all these new people in south park are stressful on my home
well you see boys the sewer is a fragile ecosystem
these new folks in town eat nothin but cous cous tofu and raw vegetables and its destroying my environment
thats why kyle thats why
theres only one time of year i can come to the surface and thats christmastime thats why i need you boys to go for me
dont forget to change your sheets once a week
oh kyle howdy-ho
well how did it go is everyone gonna stop poopin in my environment
oh i i see welluh shucks kyle i cant thank you enough for tryin
aw i cant the sunll dry me out
but i wont last long up above
all right just let me get my toothbrush
no im not leaving without you
we started this together were gonna finish it together
it sure is -dry up here
kyle be-fore i go theres something i must tell you come clo-ser
clo-ser
there is a-nother sky-walk-er
wake up
come clo-ser
clo-ser
closer
one time when you were sleeping i put myself in your mouth and had my friend take a picture
kyle
howdy-ho
that was delicious
hoooooowwwdy-ho
howdy-ho folks im afraid my buddy kyle was right theres not enough room in south park to accommodate a festival
uh folks please little towns like this simply arent made for friggin films we love havin visitors but golly too many of you is hurtin our ecosystem be-sides folks film festivals shouldnt be about what celebrities are comin or what film is gonna get sold it should be about people gettin together and watchin movies and about people who could never get their movies seen havin a chance to have it watched if only once a good film festival should be something where we all say "gaw lets forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities lets forget all those things for just a while and just watch some new art"
nyyaarrrr
hi chef your big chocolate balls are just the trick
gosh i guess i dont know my own strength

woohoo golly that sure was fun but now for our next song hold on to your bootstraps cause were gonna descend down into hell
well that was a nice little song wasnt it but lets not forget that for some people christmas is about the birth of jesus so now heres a more serious christmas song sung by eric cartman
well oh boy that was a super song and now lets hear from the school teacher mr garrison
