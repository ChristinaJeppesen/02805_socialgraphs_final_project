you have summoned the prince of temptation for what purpose
then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul so you got dopamine right thats the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable like eating sex and thats just nature right like rabbits and fish and shit they need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce
but because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it its easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems you know its not fuckin rocket science this stuff
fuck no its like okay its like being diabetic you know its like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way you know youve been eatin gluten and shit and then eventually youve got a chemical imbalance from your liver and something clicked and now youre diabetic forever right so like if you keep doing something too much eventually theres ummm a dopamine fuckup right and youre kind of screwed up for life
yeah thats pretty much what it means
well whos not filling a fuckin hole right you know i mean what kind of bullshit is that so lets talk about genetics now you still have time
okay let me get some visual aids gimme juuust a sec
so basically the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with um dopamine regulation and thats why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff okay so we kind of understand now champ
you know they all do it and its kind of my deal i have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit but you know everyone has their justification and thinks what theyre doing is okay
whats this
what you just collect coins
no see if somethings addictive because its fun thats one thing but this is just blatant skinner box manipulation wait a minute who put this out
oh that son of a bitch hes always doing this shit i tell him "temptation has to be nuanced" but he goes and does this crap again im gonna need to borrow your soul real quick kid is that alright
beelzeboot once again you lack any sense of nuance
return from whence you came
enough beelzeboot thy end has come
who hath summoned me to this realm
what do you wish of me al gore
there is only one place you can find the answers you seek it is the place where all knowledge becomes known your local library
yes it is
very well al gore let us go
yeah guys guys over here i think i found it what youre dealing with is a sifter of fate
so theres these demons that um actually come once every few generations theyre all about making deals
yeah check it out "the sifter of fate thrives on tempting mankind it will always offer a deal in exchange for mercy but the carnage will be a thousand times worse when the debt comes due"
now its here to claim its part of the bargain its sort of like when youre part of a gang feuding with a rival gang you know you ride around on your horse thinking it wont all catch up with you but it always does
so good right
