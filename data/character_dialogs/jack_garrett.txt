wow i didnt realize how horrible christs death was
no actually were guests as well im jack garrett and this is my wife elise
leave it to a child to show us all the way huh
im not sure but- uh folks i just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together the passion is causing a revolution of spirituality and we owe mel gibson and this little boy our thanks
oh i think its aramaic you know like in the movie
what was our aramaic line again
whats going on here
well maybe you should apologize
h- hes not quite as eloquent as i had pictured
you know hes right elise we shouldnt focus our faith on the torture and execution of christ
