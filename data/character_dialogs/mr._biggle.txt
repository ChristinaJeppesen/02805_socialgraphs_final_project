have a seat henrietta
henrietta as you know your mother and i have been concerned about your behavior for some time
weve had a hard time coping with the dark things youre into but weve finally had some counseling and apparently were not the only parents who have a child that is emo
do you know how your foul language breaks your mothers heart
so listen sweetie weve found a camp
a camp which is for troubled kids like you and you get to work outside and learn about responsibility
its for two weeks and when you come back we can talk about earning back some of your privileges
does she still seem better
well thats more like it
