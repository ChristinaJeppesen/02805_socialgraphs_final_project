ever since the cold war the us government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination it is called "project imagination doorway"

theyve been saying that for over forty years

we have no choice terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable theres no other option we have to nuke our imagination
we were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over but two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination and now our imaginations are running wild
by attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot and weve determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination
we tried that and kurt russell was raped by christmas critters
