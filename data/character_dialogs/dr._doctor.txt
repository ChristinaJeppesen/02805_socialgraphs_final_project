one moment please nurse i need 20 ccs of sodium pentathol stat
were an equal-opportunity employer here son
ill be right with you right after i inject this man with a long needle
there there young man medical science is nothing to be afraid of
yes i can hear the needle scraping against the bone inside
oops hes hemorrhaging
ooo his head fell off
ugh some people just have a weak stomach
well this is about all i can do for him
sorry son it might be a while
now son thats nots gonna do him any good ill let you know if theres a change in his condition
my god thats a hell of a storm
were doing the best we can maam theyve closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through for now its just me and nurse goodly
yes im afraid were critically understaffed unless we get help soon all these people in here are completely fucked
metaphorically speaking that is
hes on full life-support and breathing fine he shouldnt need any help - so long as the power doesnt go out
oof who didnt see that coming a mile away huh
nurse i could use some help in here
nurse please i need another pair of hands in here
oh sorry
please mr chef ive over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and nurse goodly
do you know anything about surgery
what why the hell didnt you say so put on some scrubs boys im making you all honorary doctors you can help us save these peoples lives
miles appendix has burst i have no choice but to operate now with our limited power i need you all to be strong for me nurse goodly will take care of the anesthesia chef you act as her arms boys you have to help with suction and bandages ready
okay first ill make an incision on the chest over the heart
suction
i found a map that shows the location of a backup generator apparently they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency but its out and away from the hospital
we must split up into two teams team a and team b team a will consist of myself stan kyle eric chef and nurse goodly team b will consist of kenny
now listen closely team b your goal will be to turn on the backup generator to do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct
meanwhile team a will go to the holding area here where there is a television and some cocoa we will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until team b makes it through the sewage duct by that time team b- remember thats you kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator it will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top and there could be velociraptors- here
once you reach the top you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television then you could proceed down into the generator and power it on are there any questions
great then lets do it go team
team b come in team b
listen team b weve found another path to the generator theres actually a nice heated walkway to it so you dont need to walk through all that sewage
oh well forget i said that then listen team b you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left
good head towards it team a out
roger team b hes reached the backup generator team b can you see the two copper nodes
good now is there a wire connecting them
damn the wire connecting the nodes is gone we need to complete the circuit between them or were screwed
theres no time once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die
no kenny you cant there must be some other way hes going to make the connection himself with his hands
kenny nnnoooooo
quickly get the scanner running again
weve got a chance now
well we made it the power is on the snow is melting and your friend mephesto is doing fine
wheres the little fat boy hell be delighted that mephestos awake
its a good thing we got her to the hospital in time
its chickenpox there seems to be a small epidemic going around your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child i take it
well thats the problem you see chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease
you know most people dont realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes
shell be fine
we just want to be cautious and monitor her here
can i talk to you outside
hell be okay but its a good idea for us to monitor him for a while
there there now its not your fault
oh wow you did wow you guys suck
yes
stan
oh yes where is stan
no no hes not missing we just cant seem to find him at this moment
oh sure sure but we have to get him back soon if he doesnt get his antibiotic shot today he could die
yes die it wont be any easy death either the chickenpox will slowly move down his trachea into his lungs
as he chokes for breath the pox will move through his inner ear into his brain making him think hes david duchovny
now moving on all fours and wheezing uncontrollably his cellular structure will regress into a gelatinous mass of--
well i hope you boys learned your lesson going out and playing around with chickenpox almost killed you all
well just be thankful we got you here in time your parents are here to see you ill send them in
boys im afraid your fat little friend has suffered head trauma
well apparently he thinks hes a vietnamese prostitute named ming li
what
no boys you need to take him home and let him get plenty of sleep
give the child to me
uhhh
its a stick
its over mr garrison this is it we had enough
youre doing fine ms mccormick its alright kenny come see the miracle of life
i can see its head
push now push hard oh my god
its ali-
alright send him in oh stanley
how can i help you
he is really really sick stanley i was seeing him last week when he first got ill but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine
alright stanley im going to be very honest with you your little friend kyle needs a kidney transplant or it is very possible that he will die
i know this is a lot to lay on someone your age but the rest of the town is so gung-ho in new age medicine that i have nowhere else to turn
thats very brave stan but ive already checked my records and you and kyle arent a match for kidneys in fact theres only one person in south park with the same blood type as kyle
why hello there eric
oh i see are you sure that now that its already out you dont wanna just let your friend kyle have it
well alright then well get you prepped for surgery if youll just sign this release
yes but it was all a trick to get you to come in and sign this release
we believe that you might have a problem
yes fat camp
hes dead the pressure must have killed him
hes very lucky you got him here when you did he was in a very advanced state of vaginitis
it occurs when a person stops eating meat those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas if we hadnt stopped it in time stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy
weve got an iv of pure beef blood pumping into stans veins and the sores are fading
five me 50 ccs of ketamine stat and get something for the kid too
im afraid hes running out of time
its his time its running out
he needs to have more time
well i suppose we could try a time transplant ill have to call in a specialist
yes but his time is still getting weaker it will give out soon unless we do something
lets not validate his delusions
what thats preposterous what this child needs is a time transplant
i warn you ms cartman your sons time could give out at any minute he needs to be kept here where his time could be monitored
your son tried to kill himself in a ritualistic fashion ive never seen before his chances of surviving are very slim im so sorry
your sons hand has a hairline fracture and two dislocated fingers
but im more concerned about his state of mind your son appears to be completely insane
jesus christ what kind of sick bastard would do this to a dog poor little pup
im afraid i wouldnt know how unfortunately for this little fella im a people doctor best we call the animal shelter
he got served worst ive ever seen
we just got the x-rays back he mostly got served here and here but the worst serving was here in the pelvis region the road to recovery will be a long one
from the test results it would appear your child was tortured by a bully he received a massive snuggie his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him he also received two indian sunburns on his forearms a charlie horse on the thigh and a second-degree titty twister and from the damage to his head area it appears he was also given a swirly a colossal one it also looks like he received a noogie and a polish bike ride
we arent sure we only know that there is no cure
jesus christ ive never seen so many indian sunburns and titty twisters in my life get a cold towel on that pink belly
over there another wet willie
give the poor kid some morphine
boys you have to let him rest some mean kid gave him a texas chili bowl
it involves tabasco sauce a telephone and the anus i dont know what kind of kid would do this to other people i only know that i wouldnt ever want to be on that kids bad side
im afraid that your son is incredibly stupid he thought he could fly with cardboard wings the stupidity is so severe that it caused a fall which has put him into a deep coma
theres no telling he may never recover well just have to wait and see
youre at the hospital eric youve been in a coma for some time
its been two days nurse you can remove his face-warmer now
now eric youve suffered massive head trauma your road to recovery will be long and arduous at least another two days
im sorry detectives there was nothing we could do
yes it was pretty severe
this is the young man here he was in a coma for over sixteen hours
of course nurse
then thats it we brought him back
call the parents theyre going to be shocked to find out their son is alive
its the latest in electro-plastilical science your sons organs are all functioning again
im afraid he cant respond to you you see being dead for that long most of kennys brain cells died from lack of oxygen your son is alive but in what we call a "persistent vegetative state"
im afraid no brain cells cannot be repaired once dead but his soul is still in here almost trapped in here if you will kenny is the same as he ever was its just that now hes more like a tomato
a feeding tube it pumps a nutrient paste directly into kennys stomach with it we can actually keep kenny the tomato alive for years
he cant respond to you boys being dead for that long caused severe damage to his brain
but this just doesnt seem right
im afraid ive been given a court order to remove kennys feeding tube
im sorry i have no choice
well all his vital signs are still normal from his outward appearance i would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency
yes im afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus
well the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene it mustve stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence
im sorry son ms cartman could i have a word with you ms cartman i know this must be very difficult for you i for one cant stand red-haired freckled kids but you need to understand there is no cure your son will be ginger his whole life you might want to just put him down
all right but youre gonna have to take certain precautions now its very important that you keep eric out of the sun the sun is his worst enemy
oh hello coach
well he isnt worse but he isnt getting better its almost as if his cancer were tied
he seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game and with a tie hes in a kind of cancer limbo
look hes coming around again
just be aware of this coach if you lose the big game that little boy is going to die faster than steve irwin in a tank full of stingrays
well theres no doubt in my mind mr marsh you are constipated
well what food have you been eating
im going to prescribe a laxative but i must warn you when you do finally pass this stool it might be very painful
during the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood a mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with hiv it was a one in a billion fluke
were going to do everything in our power to make this up to you eric for starters i think i owe you some ice cream
no it isnt strep
mrs broflovski has your son ever had a blood transfusion
little boy have you been having unprotected anal sex
weve run every test imaginable little kyle here is infected with hiv
it took us a long time to narrow it down but there is no doubt
little boy are you sure you havent taken it up the hoohoo just once or twice
no hes just passed out we should get him to bed
well mr marsh it looks like you are in prefect health your bloodwork came back great and all your vitals appear normal
yep you check out fine
for what
mr marsh you dont qualify for medicinal marijuana
medicinal marijuana is for people who arent healthy aids patients cancer patients you know people going through chemo the thc helps them eat and take the pain you are in fine shape
well theres a lot of ways you can get cancer
the what
mr marsh im afraid that the tests came back positive you do have testicular cancer
now the good new is it hasnt spread anywhere we should probably schedule to have them re-
your prescription for what
what the hell is going on
this is the tenth case ive seen this week it cant be a coincidence something in this town is giving men testicular cancer
hold on hold people people please we are all forgetting what is really at issue here look around these men all have cancer its no coincidence that when this building changed the rise in cancer went up dont you see the kfc was keeping people healthy
and another bill has been repealed as well because ever since we got rid of kfc weve seen a great rise in cancer but today we welcome back kfc and all the medical benefits it gives us
your stomach seems to be filled with boogers and cum
and you say youve never had a mustache before
have you put anything toxic in your body lately any drugs or alcohol
oh nonono that-thats totally fine
holy shit
