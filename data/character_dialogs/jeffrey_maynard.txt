i would swear it on my life your play shall want for nothing
now the first thing a good musical needs is a big opening number something that sets up the entire show
wait whats that you say a thanksgiving turkey is what you require i know of a turkey
during my years on broadway i worked with a turkey who could do all kinds of tricks she even jumped through a hoop of fire
i will go promptly and call her trainer on the morrow you shall have your trick performing turkey
now to the refrain
whoa-aaaa
let him rest in peace let him rest why must he die
â€”and into your hands uh he buh
how is it going eric
well you know in theater sometimes we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing
lets see helen keller was blind and deaf perhaps you should see what it is like deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind here
just relax just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow
well did you see anything
oh thats too bad
i do i know the part if i must i can go on
i cannot hear what they are saying i cannot tell them how i feel i think our babys deaf and blind oh no
if only i could say things that go on in my mind i think our babys deaf and blind oh no
wawa
now that i can communicate the world is not so cold and dark
