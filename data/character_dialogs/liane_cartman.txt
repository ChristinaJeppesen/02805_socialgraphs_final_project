eric youre only making it worse
this isnt about that eric and you know it youre upset youre upset because you dont want your mom to have a job
it is true youre scared and youre jealous that a job will take my attention away from you
its ok to be scared eric i know that im the only family you have but youre making everything worse for us
eric you need to stop this right now
it doesnt work that way eric you arent going to make any money—youre just driving up the market and none of your deals will make it through escrow
fine eric will you stop all this if i quit my job
