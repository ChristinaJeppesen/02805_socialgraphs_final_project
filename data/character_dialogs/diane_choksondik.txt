play time is over children do you understand me i dont know how your last teacher behaved but this is the fourth grade and it is time to go to work
well young man i hope you have a good explanation for this
this is the fourth grade you need to grow up
now get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class
now let us begin our first-day exam silence
principal victoria i would like a word
my new students are the most misbehaved illiterate brain-dead group of children i have ever come across
one of them is mentally handicapped for christs sake
the one in the wheelchair look i would like to have a talk with their last years teacher who was it mr uh-heh garrison
why where did he go
but i need help reaching these kids i have nothing but the highest expectations for them and with god as my witness-
im going to teach these kids the wonders of the world so that they can reach the top i hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this mr garrison and with that i will bid you good day
alright children i hope you all did your homework last night please pass your papers up to the frontuh
i said pass your papers to the fronteh
its choksondik and you are all going to have detention

well well well id say somebody has some explaining to do
children children come back here
i have had it
these children are out of control i must speak with their last years teacher mr garrison
what in gods name happened to him
and nobody has found him
i see then the only way ill find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find mr garrison myself
oh ill find him even if i have to climb up and up and up
what
hello-oo-ooo oh what am i doing im gonna get myself killed is anyone here mister mr garrison
i am the new fourth grade teacher ive come to seek your help please i dont know how to handle the new fourth graders ive tried everything i need to know how you taught them
mr garrison you knew how to reach these kids youre my only hope
choksondik
mr garrison these children are depending on me to give them a future i cant do it without your guidance please help me for them for the future of our children
done
"children we are now going to do math problems"
"uuh ah you will do them or else youll be in very big trouble"
"dont use that kind of language young man"
no
oh
pre-sent them
im ready im not afraid
what lives inside
oh alrighty what the why theres nothing in here but an exit to the other side theres nothing in here at all oh and i actually thought my mental demons would be in here wait a minute maybe theres not supposed to be anything in here maybe im supposed to see that i alone do have the strength to reach the kids i think i get it now
alright children i hope you all did your- oowhat is going on now
oh good gravy not this again
children i will have order
children get back into your seats
eric i mean it
present them
you said "suck my balls" well go ahead whip em out and ill suck em
now children listen to me why do you want to go back in time life isnt about going back its about going forward yes there are times in our life that we wish we could relive but if we already lived them perfectly why live them again the adventure of life is that theres always something new new challenges new experiences a fun game is a game that gets harder as it goes so it is with life do you understand
alright students that will be quite enough if youre ready lets continue on with the fourth grade
well i think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills uh i i think that the holiday just has become a joke
we got so caught up in the little things of christmas like love and family that we almost forgot its buying things that makes our economy thrive
alright children in lieu of the common usage im sposed to clarify the schools position on the word "shit"
yes but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
you can only use it in the non-literal sense for instance "thats a shitty picture of me" is now fine hoever the literal noun form of "this is a picture of shit" is still naughty
the adjective form is now also acceptable for example "the weather outside is shitty" however the literal adjective is not appropriate for example "my bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty and i had to clean it with a rag which then also became shitty" thats right out
very good timmy
yes thats now fine
boys watch your language shit
alright children lets settle down as you know this coming friday is earth day and im pleased to announce that the national earth day organization has chosen south park as its location for the earth day brainwashing festival
the heads of the earth day brainwashing organization are here to tell you all about it
im sorry boys but nothings more important than earth day
naive at what cost chef parents we have to face facts children in america are having sex at younger and younger ages stds are affecting younger and younger kids all the time the only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex
alright girls even though this may be stuff you dont want to hear you need to hear it
fun its going to be fun well lets start with our first lesson then shall we sexually transmitted diseases thats right because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them how fun is that hmmm is that fun
today over 20000 americans will contract a sexual disease today twelve thousand more tomorrow and the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say "its not going to happen to me" you say "oh ms choksondik that happens to girls in detroit in brooklyn but not here in colorado" wrong gonorrhea herpes chlamydia hpv hiv syphilis hepatitis b hepatitis c the list goes on and on these are serious diseases they have serious consequences you think that sex is about fun and games and love wrong sex is about disease heres a little picture of herpes
and heres a little syphilis for you
thats right girls heres what happens when you dont get boys to use condoms
oh its no problem mr mackey its probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway
well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences we have to teach them that diseases are possible even with just oral sex
using your mouth on the penis or vagina
its just too bad these girls are having sex so young
did i what
well if you must know im still somewhat of a virgin but im not ashamed of it i wasnt sought after much in high school or college i was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses the only boyfriend i ever had was this attractive popular boy named steven garrett i liked him very much but i found out that he was dating me because he lost a bet on the super bowl the loser had to go out with me for three days
people can be very cruel anyway i know its hard to understand
your nickname
right
wow ive never met a man who is as sexually unappealing as me
well im quite happy without sex i mean with all the diseases and problems out there who needs it right
well back to the lesson plan then
okay "oral sex"
i knew it well at least we scared them enough to protect themselves but now maybe youll believe me when i say that we need to be teaching even younger than fourth grade
kindergarten
weve got to get to the students before they start having sex nu-not after
alright girls yesterday we went over the myriad of diseases you can get from boys but today were going to talk about the most horrible they can give you of all pregnancy thats right since you girls have decided to be sexually active teen pregnancy is at an all-time high you seem to think its gonna be fun and neat to have a baby-well lets watch a little video shall we
girls girls where are you going
ive already gone through that with the girls its pretty simple do you wanna drink
something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse
or the shaft of the penis
why yes the nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis like they are in the clitoris of the woman
sexual stimulation oh is this wrong
yeah what do you do when you think about me
do you touch yourself
haawww haawww
oh my god oh god yeah stop stop
its your turn
do you want me
tell me
wait wait wait do you have a condom
oh well fuck it oh god give it to me
woh ooh thats it baby thats it
did you feel something
im afraid this is all my fault i think i went a little overboard scaring the girls i forgot to tell them that to get diseases from boys you have to have sex with them first
hes right i never knew how special and personal sex was un until just recently
next in line come on lets keep it moving kids
kyle were taking pictures without hats today
alright class i have your school photos to hand out-
most of them are very nice but apparently one of you thinks its fun to spoil their school pictures and thinks hes a comedian that person will be spending the afternoon in the principals office
school photos arent for joking around so you arent getting your photo back butters
for the rest of you i think your pictures turned out very nicely
eric calm down im trying to yell at butters
you know very well my name isnt chokesonrocks its choksondik say it right or you can go to the principals with butters
your mother is waiting for you in the principals office
and i know youll all be very nice to our new student kyle why dont you tell us a little about yourself
okay why dont you go ahead and take a seat kyle

now lets get on with our lesson on the-
im sorry kyle youll just have to make do now lets get back to the le-

she needs to see you now
okay children step off the bus and form a group next to the nice redneck - i mean rancher
lets all say hello to rancher bob
sit down boys
all right children before we get started has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard it probably got knocked on the floor somewhere can you all just please look around your desks for it
no oh oh well never mind ive got a backup one in the desk okay today children were gonna learn about multiplying times five
now whenever we multiply a number times five the result is going to end in a zero or a five
what is it butters
oh alright butters take the bathroom pass and go okay so for instance children-
just go butters okay so for instance five times one is what eric
five times one
who are you
hey that kid took my last eraser come back here kid

it looks fine butters okay hold on and stay here children
