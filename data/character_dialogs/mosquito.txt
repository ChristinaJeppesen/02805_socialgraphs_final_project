why cant it be mosquito and friends
have so
theres like a big fire or something in town
and friends
yeah i almost got in trouble for it
you want us to take naked pictures of butters to use as blackmail that doesnt sound very superhero-like
nono look whats going on down in the gulf is much more important than blackmailing another hero
i think we should help raise money for the relief aid by having a bake sale
i have a recipe for lemon bars from my mom we could wear our costumes outside the grocery store and sell lemon bars which would be a good deed and help people
and thats another thing no more picking on mint-berry crunch
no but we are all equal from now on we vote who wants to go with my plan
right
mosquito
thats almost it superheroes were about out of lemon bars
