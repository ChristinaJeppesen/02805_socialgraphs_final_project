theres two things that separate sooper foods from all the other grocery stores fun and safety what do you think peters what are the chances that this jewpacabra is real
we cant afford to take that chance get this kid whatever he needs
so where are we heading first
the bahamas
where to now
all the kids will be so disappointed
alright grab him
look were sorry but if its you that jewpacabra wants we dont have a choice
just a little blood to try and draw it out we just cant risk the creature showing up tomorrow our entire business is based on fun and safety
hello young man let me start off by saying sooper foods is absolutely not an anti-semitic company but if your people do have a monster creature that feeds on easter children we just wanted to let you know there is a sacrifice for it in the park that is totally fun and safe to eat thank you
there are two things people think about when they are grocery shopping fun and safety on this beautiful easter morning we are thrilled to give back to he people of south park who for the third year in a row have made our grocery store number 4 in fun and number 6 in safety let the hunt begin
