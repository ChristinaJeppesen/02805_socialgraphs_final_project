hey guys stan i remember you said last night that youd lost your wallet so i made you a new one i carved a picture of john elway into the leather on the front
hey my familys on their way over to the fire station to donate blood you wanna come along
oh here comes my family now
oh well id like to but oh man i would miss you guys so much
so what do you guys wanna do
oh cool im gonna do that tomorrow
so hey i heard your dad came over last night and he and my dad talked about joseph smith thats great
sure
well he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told and then he translated what was written on the plates into the book of mormon
hey everybody
hey stan
hey thats only cool guys you can believe whatever you want
yeah hooray for the marshes
hey stan
listen i just wanted to let you know you dont have to worry about me tryin to be your friend anymore
look maybe us mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense and maybe joseph smith did make it all up but i have a great life and a great family and i have the book of mormon to thank for that the truth is i dont care if joseph smith made it all up because what the church teaches now is loving your family being nice and helping people and even though people in this town might think thats stupid i still choose to believe in it all i ever did was try to be your friend stan but youre so high and mighty you couldnt look past my religion and just be my friend back youve got a lot of growing up to do buddy suck my balls
