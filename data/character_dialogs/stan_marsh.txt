well were gonna go work on getting kyles dad a nurection
lets see jesus got crucified then he died then three days later he had his urection lets see theres fourteen stations of the cross now it says we can makes costumes out of sheets
come on randy you said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight
station one jesus is condemned to death by pilate
kyle
station two jesus takes his cross
and then jesus disciple peter denies he knows him
station eleven jesus is nailed to the cross
then a crown of thorns was placed on jesuss head and jesus was all like "thanks"
and then jesus was lead away to mount sinai where he dies and has a resurrection three days later
this spot looks good

dad youve got to work people are dying dad youve got to come up with a solution
well that doesnt matter i learned something from the stations of the cross
see at first jesus was all like "why me" and he was all pissed off and stuff but then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else so he stopped thinking about his own misery and did what had to be done right as jesus was dying he raised his hand and said "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"

the kid will never even know
we can take the bus to the city theres super-rich people down there

there you can tell this is the kids window cause its got mega man stickers on it cartman once youre in the kids room leave the tooth under the pillow then come back out well wait for the parents to see it and leave money then swing you back in the house to grab it

that does it weve got no other choice weve got to bust cartman out of jail
i saw a movie once where they baked a cake and put a nail file inside of it
cartman why the hell did you have to commit a hate crime were gonna lose to girls because of you
yeah you stupid umbassday
yeah
sshh
how are we supposed to give them to you
but theyre gonna search you on your way back to your cell
alright here
wow i really wish i hadnt sat here and watched that
that sucks that we couldnt give him the nail file
theres only one thing we can do we have to go see token and see if hell forgive cartman for hate-criming him come on were running out of time
yeah you know they bus in people from different races to our school to promote cultural diversity
yeah
hi can token come out and play
token you dont wanna see us guys lose to girls tomorrow do you
its not
well why dont you tell the governor yourself
okay go ahead and start
oh uhyeah hello mr governor and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws entitled "hate crime laws a savage hypocrisy" yes over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws
if a person vandalizes a government building is it not because of his hate for the government
mayor it is time to stop splitting people into groups all hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos that we arent the same
that is our presentation an idea that we call
just wait we got cartman pardoned hell be here any second
alright wheres clyde
get on the sled you fat piece of shit
its cartman
all right lets do this
come on weve gotta catch up to them
were not gonna make it
we did it
yeah were never gonna take you ass for granted ever again

oh thank you chef how nice
i feel different
wait a minute phil collins sucks ass
get off the stage phil collins we want timmy
no you see we learned something today yeah sure we laughed at timmy but whats wrong with laughter just because we laugh at something doesnt mean we dont care about it timmy made us smile and playing made timmy smile so where was the harm in that the people that are wrong are the ones that think people like timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the publics eye the cool thing about timmy being in a band was that he was in your face and you had to deal with him whether you laughed or cried or felt nothing thats why timmy rules
why do we have to dress up isnt this just a circus with elephants and lions and stupid clowns

how come you wanna help the fatass
you got foolied outlander were the only ones with a working phone and if you had taken our book then its one of us who dies tonight at carousel
you mean in the before time in the long long ago
if we tell you will you help us stop fatass
alright everybody gather round were gonna tell the story of the before time again
way back in the long long ago we all lived by the birth-givers laws but the birth-givers were unfair they made us go to bed early and eat broccoli
and so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear by using the magic m word
soon we were without power water or fresh food but we tried to survive under the guidance of the provider
the fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider the fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal so we made ourselves the superintendents of school but then he just made himself the mayor the town split sides and thats when the provider got angry
so now every night the provider must be appeased at carousel we need their book so one of ours doesnt die
we all know that one day the provider will set us free make everything like it was in the before time in the long long ago
yes no foolies
awesu-home
no if they have it one of ours will die for carousel
its time for carousel haha your side doesnt have its book fatass that means someone on your side is sacrificed tonight

hi jesus its me
this guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying theyre miracles my friend kyle thinks hes totally awesome
i read in the bible that you did miracles too if you could go in front of these people and do your miracles then theyll all see that david blaine isnt so special
can you do it again
thats it thats how you did that trick
that trick sucks jesus
dude we have to do something this guy is performing more miracles in denver tonight hes gonna get more followers and itll be impossible for me to get kyle out

super best friends

i am ready
yeah
so you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions you guys are all actually friends

kyle you cant kill yourself
kyle you have to hold your breath oh very funny
listen up everyone you dont need david blaine to tell you how to live see cults are dangerous because they promise you hope happiness and maybe even an afterlife but in return they demand you pay money any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and learn its tenets is wrong see all religions have something valuable to teach but just like the super best friends learned it requires a little bit of them all

stop it tweek were pretending like nothing happened
oh jeez change the channel
they found the sea men its only a matter of time before they find the women too
were dead
hey tweek youre in this just as much as we are
chef we did something kind of bad
we need you to promise not to tell anybody
we killed our teacher and they found our seamen in her stomach
so what should we do
this is it
yeah stupid
dude its probably still in her stomach
what do we do now
do you see the sea people
yeah
aaah
lets go
the sea people that we put in the teachers coffee
and then we put them back in the tank
okay goodnight cartman
oh no what now
how how did that happen
theyve already accomplished so much
look the sea people have evolved to an egyptian-like culture
well drop them in
thats cool
okay now lets put the sea ciety in its new home
close your eyes and suck it out of a hose
hm
hey what are you doing man cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody youve gotta come
yeah and theyve been on the air for like thirteen years of course theyve done everything
hey look everybody the other side of the aquarium is building another statue
the sea people on tweeks side just suicide-bombed the cartman statue
that sounds pretty fun
what are they talking about
um cool
like money what
what would the priest possibly want to put in our butts
we had to go meet with this counselor lady and she asked us if the priest ever put anything in our butts
we dont know were- thats what were tryin to figure out
chef what would a priest want to stick up my butt
what
cartman shoved food up his ass and now hes tryin to crap out his mouth
youve had five dude
uh cartman shoved his lunch up his ass and crapped out his mouth
what he did
yeah it does
yeah it does
so
dude look
does this mean we have to go to church on sundays again
oh cool a preview
aw dude why would they do that
thats gay
why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies
goddamnit that pisses me off
tweek is right it isnt fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different movies are art and art shouldnt be modified
we have to do something lets form a club
no fatass i mean a club to protect films from their directors so they cant be messed with
well whats wrong with it
alright lets go get the gymnasium ready tweek you go make fifty hats
what
yeah lets see if anyone has even shown up yet dude theres like a thousand people in there
relax tweek were just gonna have to go in there and explain what happened there are more important things right now than free hats
okay uh we wanna thank you all for coming were really happy to see such enthusiasm for our cause
uh one thing before i continue unfortunately we dont have enough of the free hats for everyone
you mean you just came because you believe in our cause
aaaah okay apparently theres been a bit of a misunderstanding this is a rally to save films from their directors
waitwaitwaitwait dont you see whats happening out there the films you all grew up with that touched your lives and are part of your soul are now being updated and changed join us and we can be a group that makes a difference
uh sure and well also try to free hat
212 213 214 members
really thats great
if we go on nightline the whole country can hear about whats happening to our classic films
when did we do dibs for it
uh-look if the beatles went back and updated their white album every few years what would we have now
members this is our darkest hour weve just learned that george lucas and steven spielberg now intend to update and change raiders of the lost ark theres only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed mr secretary
that is our understanding
its just that you know he killed twenty-three babies
alright alright but right now weve gotta focus on getting those original prints of raiders
well it looks like were gonna have to do this ourselves
okay go
over here
aw really
waitwaitwaitwaitwait i thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song
so we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
those rams can do to us what they will mr lucas but well never stop trying to protect films

awesome
uh over here please
we told you that
no no hes trapped in cartmans body
heh hey wait a minute dude
he seemed better on tv
dude you dont believe that guy talked to your grandma do you
we dont get to go to scotland
oh well good luck getting kenny out of you fatso
thats us come on
huh
dude you were going to see four white birds eventually
yes now come on our plane is gonna leave
what
kyle no kyle aw crap
hey uh i need to talk to mr edward please
im not here for a reading i just need to ask him something real quick
jesus christ
hey uh i need to ask you a big favor you you did a reading on my best friend and uh well you kind of messed him up
look my friend kyle wont fly back home to colorado all i need you to do is just talk to him and tell him you know the whole talking to dead people isnt for real
right but its not its a trick you do and i need you to just let my friend kyle know that so he can go on with his life
yes we all hear voices in our heads its called "intuition" get over yourself and tell my friend its just for fun
no you give them false hope and a belief in something that isnt real
no dude youre a douche
then youre a stupid douche
im nine years old
you are so a douche im nominating you for the biggest douche in the universe award you douche son of a bitch
kyle kyle
look i went and saw that john edward guy hes just a big douche
kyle you cant run your life based on what some douchey psychic said they all just use a technique called "cold reading" theyve used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them
no hes not
alright look ill show you i just need a volunteer how about you
okay im gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you okay
okay watch kyle uh its an older man someone very close to you
does this month november hold a special significance
right because hes saying "tell her happy birthday"
see kyle i just started with something really vague i chose an older man because im betting that based on this womans age her father is most likely dead but if her father wasnt dead i could still say it was some other older man
i didnt i just asked her if november meant anything her father could have died in november or thanksgiving could have been really special for them but i go with the birthday and validate it now as if i knew by saying "he wishes you a happy birthday"
okay ill just use an old standard hes saying "the money stop worrying about the money"
no it isnt when a father dies inheritance is usually an issue and money is something everyone worries about
what
no wait
okay listen to me listen very carefully this is a trick that i am doing okay watch all im gonna do is say a name that im gonna pick at random okay they want me to acknowledge pete or peter
no stop clapping all i did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response now that i see that theres a lone woman crying my instinct tells me peter was her husband so i say "peter was your husband"
stop it i didnt do anything
i didnt start by saying peter is dead i started by saying "they want me to acknowledge peter" that could have meant peter was in the audience or that peter was somebodys friend or peter had died i couldnt be wrong see now i can look at this woman and see that shes fairly young so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died so i can say something like "im getting that peters death was very untimely"
okay lets back up not literally
here look kyle i found tons of testimonials on the internet saying that john edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show and he pays actors to be plants in the audience
fine i give up you wanna stay in new york then go ahead
no i dont think either one of us can
im saying this to you john edward you are a liar you are a fake and you are the biggest douche ever
because the big questions in life are tough why are we here where are we from where are we going but if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you were never gonna find the real answer to those questions you arent just lying youre slowing down the progress of all mankind you douche
fine douche
no i dont wanna talk to you i wanna talk to the audience
you see i learned something today at first i thought you were all just stupid listening to this douches advice but now i understand that youre all here because youre scared youre scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding you all want to believe in it so much i know you do you find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you but think about it is that really what you want to just be floating around after you die having to talk to this asshole we need to recognize this stuff for what it is magic tricks because whatevers really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche
yeah
theres nothing special about you dude get over yourself
no it cant be
oh dude
now do you people believe me
whats going on
so throw it away
you guys those commercials are just exaggerations
its just a stupid plant that makes you dumb touching it wont hurt you
fine i will there see i touched marijuana im not a terrorist i didnt shoot anybody and i dont feel like doing more drugs now no big deal
aw come on mom

three four five one colfax avenue come on butters

butters part of being on an adventure is you go places youre not supposed to go
what the hell is going on here
i cant believe it its all a scam
theyve all been lying to us this whole time
butters dont you get it those assholes arent our future selves our parents hired them to make us more motivated
they didnt come back to the past you dumbass theyre actors
it is lying butters your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me get it
whos that
what
we have to teach our parents a lesson show them they cant just play with our emotions like that
youre gay its fine if youre gay butters i dont care

i guess this is it
uh hello were here about the revenge on our parents
cartman
what the hell are you doing here
god-damnit i knew this was too good to be true come on butters lets go
oh sorry i thought this was a legitimate business
how many parents have you exacted revenge upon
our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves it was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol
how much is this going to cost us
yeah
yeah
yeah
thats not neato that sucks
youre gonna smear butters parents walls with poop i thought each revenge was unique and customized
dude thats not extreme enough my parents arent gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls i want them to see what they did was wrong i want them to have to admit that they lied to me
dude
no thats too extreme
just forget it cartman you dont know what youre doing
hey future self
you know that thing that i kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that ive never told anybody about you know the thing that i take out of the shoebox every night before i go to sleep
you must know what im talking about
mom dad i dont think that guy is from the future
no you know what i think i think this is all an elaborate hoax and i think that whoever is doing it doesnt have very much respect for me see the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them to be honest with them i think the whole future self thing is a lie and lies are never the right way to get your message across
what
hide and go seek huh
i dont believe that hes my future self
no i actually have a way to be sure im going to cut off my hand if he is my future self then his hand will disappear
but i have to know for sure
maybe its the hand i smoked that first joint with here i go im gonna do it
yes
aaah
thats weird because i really didnt cut off my hand it was fake
butters

see everyone on the internet copies their music from their cds and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer
kennys right we should download some judas priest too
what the hell is that
were sorry well well never download music for free again
boy ill say
wugh dude i cant wait to just go back home and get back to band practice
oh yeah
it is
yeah you dont even know anything about christianity
what a dumbass our band is way cooler than his
dude i didnt know being in a band was gonna be this tough
hey its that lars ulrich guy
i cant take this much longer maybe were just not cut out to be in a band
what
is this for real this is for real
besides maybe our songs would have gotten downloaded for free but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert
so dude what are you gonna do about your bet with cartman are you- gonna pay im
i thought albums win either gold or platinum
hm guess he got what he deserved
hey dad how come they let old people drive
but they kill people
i think old people should have rights grandpa i just dont wanna die
what is that
i think so
what is he saying
oh
dad im scared
im not staying the winter in this room we just need to tell old people they cant drive anymore
uh grandpa i dont think you should be driving
ah i think theres a police car behind you grandpa
whats that
the american association of retired persons
hey dad
dad why is everyone letting old people do this why doesnt somebody stop them
no come on dad cant you guys do it
all right check it out kenny did reconnaissance on the town
yeah i remember hearing about that
all right
we did it
yeah or we just go to country kitchen buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors cant get in
oh stop it dad this is partly your fault
look all grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child i think half of what he was angry about wasnt what you were doing but how you were doing it
and grandpa you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior but you should also realize that when youre behind the wheel youre a killing machine
dude i hate my family
dude i wonder where kyle is
dude thats not funny you shouldnt joke about that
whats casa bonita
yeah itll be awesome just the four of us
yeah its kinda weird
yeah
dude we should check over at starks pond butters always hangs out over there
really
dude its kyles birthday we should do whatever he wants to do
i knew hed turn up
cartman stop it
yeah screw that kid
well maybe he wont fight
all right im gonna go kick his ass
no im im gonna kick your ass
im gonna kick your ass bitch
huh
dude stop it
shut up butters
im going over to his house for dinner tonight
hes a really nice kid
whats that
no
the book of mormon whats that
whos joseph smith
no
what happened then
no i was supposed to be home at eight
hello
hey dad how come you never told me about joseph smith
the guy who spoke to god and jesus
thats not what the harrisons said
the new people that moved in down the street mr harrison said that joseph smith spoke to god and jesus and they told him none of the religions were right
theyre not kooks theyre cool i mean how come we never have a night where we dont watch any tv and we just do stuff together and eat and drink
but thats just you and your friends
mr harrison said that i should be following heavenly fathers plan and i dont even know what that is
yeah
see thats what happened to me
thats what they made me think too
shut up dude theyre a nice family and gary is actually really smart and talented
whats the big deal cant i have other friends you guys should give gary a chance
wow you made this
uh i dont think so gary i have to uh
uh no ive got a lot to do
yeah i had a question about that joseph smith guy
what happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground
yeah but how
dad did you know that that joseph smith guy read the book of mormon out of a hat
its just that the book of mormon says a lot of strange stuff like that adam and eve lived in jackson county missouri
but school taught me that the first man and woman lived in africa
hey gary
dad
yeah
wait mormons actually know this story and they still believe joseph smith was a prophet
no it proves he did make it all up are you blind
no its a matter of logic if youre gonna say things that have been proven wrong like that the first man and woman lived in missouri and that native americans came from jerusalem then youd better have something to back it up all youve got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat and then couldnt do it again when the translations were hidden
i dont wanna be mormon dad
oh stop it thats another thing why do you have to be so freakin nice all the time it isnt normal you just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my dad
im not hanging around that kid anymore
you guys were right okay the new kids a douche now i just gotta find a way to keep him away from me
oh brother
i dont
ugh jesus christ
give me a hit give me another one give me another one
whoops
mom dad it was just a-
what
yeah whats the problem
yeah dont worry dude things arent gonna get out of hand
those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice
huh
yeah maybe youre right
what are you doing cartman
well get away from us then
stop it cartman go die on your own
daaaad
anti-smoking people are trying to kill cartman and he wont stay away from us
help you fatass we werent in the commercial remember
oh all right
why
so its either deal with all that or be grounded for three weeks
yup
it wasnt the tobacco companies fault that we smoked it was our fault us we should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do
well i guess we learned our lesson
all right you guys its first down ill hike the ball on the third "set hut" kyle and cartman go deep post out kenny run a slant down the middle butters be ready for the screen
football
okay 23 blue 23 set hut set hut
what
oh whoa wait a minute what did i do wrong i havent even talked to wendy for weeks
kyle will you talk to wendy for me
cause i need to know why she broke up
dude please i might still have a chance to make things work please just go talk to her
what thats no answer go tell her to be more direct with me
kyle this is my life jimmy
jimmy will you go talk to wendy for me
just go talk to her an and be poetic tell her shes my muse-no tell her tell her shes a con-tinuing source of inspiration to me
shes a continuing source of inspiration to me
well
over jesus
go away
why whats the point of living when the only girl i ever loved is gone
you guys have no idea how this feels its like you always hear songs about a broken heart and you think its just a figure of speech but its true my chest hurts i feel this like sinking feeling where my heart is its broken
can we go please
no dude i feel worse
dude i dont have time to start over with other girls im nine years old dude if i dont work things out with wendy i could be alone my whole life
i cant let wendy go this whole time ive been having my friends do all the talking for me its time i took control
something i should have done a long time ago
bebe you need to go talk to wendy for me right now all this time ive been trying to have my friends do all the talking for me now i realize i need her friends to do it tell her i love her
okay so whats the most romantic thing i can think of
i cant believe it shes in love with somebody else
theres nothing else i can do she was my whole life
maybe i should at least they will understand me maybe i should hang with the goth kids
but if life is only pain then whats the point of living

the pain is everlastingi miss you so much babewant to hold you in my arms again girlwant to-

so they can fill my head with more disney lies about how perfect the world is i dont think so

dude my car sucks i gotta get a new one
chef we just got served
over at the true value parking lot there were just these kids we never saw before showed up and they were like really good dancers and we dont really understand what it means but i guess-
some kids from orange county
no
but dad i dont know how to dance or nothin
but dad-
yeah lets go race it right now
what
i thought i was supposed to
but why
i i dont know he seems all right
yeah im- im right here dad
okay good
god dammit
hey guys uh- you guys know how to dance right
cool because theres this competition on saturday and i have to find the very best dancers in south park to be on my crew my friends cant do it because they suck ass so will you be in my dance troupe
okay thatll work fine listen theres a dance competition this saturday and i need good dancers so i dont get served
please you guys our whole towns reputation is at stake will any of you do it
great
all right we gotta find three other kids that can dance
the arcade
dude hes incredible
hey kid youre pretty good how would you like to join our dance troupe
yeah
dude we need you
its all right my friend chef is gonna coach us
all right thats three
huh
oh yeah wait a minute i know just where to go
ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick
and so were putting all the best dancers in south park together to beat orange county
so youll do it
all right we just need one more person
what the state tap champion is from here who
leopold stotch wait a minute you mean
butters listen theres gonna be a competition this saturday and we want you to join our troupe
its a dance-off we heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago
but you were werent you y-you went to the nationals in nebraska
we just asked him to join our dance troupe we heard he was state tap champion
dammit where are we gonna get our fifth member
a duck dude dont be stupid those oc kids are professional dancers now come on theres gotta be one other talented person in south park
all right so youre sure he can dance
hey he- is that the only song hell dance to
my friends i think we have ourselves a dance troupe
yeah dude the best dancers south park has to offer
were gonna get served on saturday arent we
well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-
i came to ask you one more time to join the crew everyone is practicing really hard but i dont think we have any kind of shot without you
your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country
yeah she said your shoe came off it wasnt your fault
look butters accidents happen we all have to live with that
well it was nine actually one of the women was pregnant
and eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward
but that isnt the point butters the point is that this is now its on and there are people who need you to step up look nobody likes having to rise to a challenge but competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "haha im better than you" is part of life and if you cant face that then you might as well sit here and play legos until youre an old man
fine but someday youre gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it otherwise you might as well move to france with all the other pussies
what
what happened
aw what do we do chef
butters
all right butters
dude are you still pretending to be a robot
uh yeah butters hes real cool
'''' hey check it out dude somebody bought the donovan's old house ''''

whoa
mom dad did you see they found a man from the future
mom can we go try to see the people from the future i have a bunch of questions i wanna ask em
night mom wow two people from the future how cool
hello mrs landis would you like snow-shoveling service again today
all right guys come on lets go to the next house
son of a bitch
its affecting kids too me and my friends started our own snow-shoveling business we were trying to be responsible and make money you know but then the people came along and and now were out of work too oh they took our jobs
i was at a rally to protest all the immigrants from the future coming in and tryin to-
who is that
oh but thats the problem those goobacks are taking our jobs
well dude they are taking peoples jobs away
i wanted my job
timecist
people from the future right got it
thats right
can you speak in present-day english please
uh yeah i want a double cheeseburger and fries
no a double cheeseburger and fries
what
im trying to order a double cheeseburger
no its not a chicken sandwich i want a goddamned cheeseburger and some goddamned fries you fucking goobacks
aw- awwww
aw come on dad how come i have to go to work with you
they took yer jarb
i think its wrong to call them goobacks because theyre no different from us theyre just humans trying to make their lives better look it sucks that the immigrants time is so crappy but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time then its just gonna make our time crappy too maybe the answer isnt trying to stop the future from happening but making the future better
i mean maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future then then the future wont be so bad and these immigrants wont need to come back here looking for work
were doing it
dude wait wait ho- hold on wait a second this is gay
okay sorry my bad everyone back in the pile
but mr garrison if we change our mascot that means the eco-terrorists win

im not voting
i just think this whole thing is stupid
it was ridiculous we have to have a new school mascot and were supposed to vote between a giant douche and a turd sandwich
no i think voting is great but if i have to choose between a douche and a turd i just dont see the point
mom i just dont think theres much of a difference between a douche and a turd i d-i dont care
puff daddy
i
"vote or die" what the hell does that even mean
aaaah
okay ill vote
i guess
okay
im voting
yeah i know
i thought i was supposed to make my own decision
wait a minute you didnt want me to vote you wanted me to vote for your guy
oh forget it im not gonna be persuaded into voting and im and im not gonna be threatened into voting if i dont feel comfortable with it im not gonna vote and you can all just live with it
the whole thing is a joke
b-bani-banishment
you-youre all joking right
im not voting
dad isnt this a little extreme
hello
oh thank god
awww
what about me

wow you guys really love animals
ill live with you
he said i can stay
ahh no thanks thats okay
i do love animals just not like you guys do
i cant i was banished for not voting
i think voting is great i just didnt care this time because it was between a giant douche and a turd sandwich
i guess i guess youre right
aaah
aaaah
i learned that id better get used to having to pick between a douche and a turd sandwich because its usually the choice ill have
dude so my vote didnt even really matter

theyre doing it in the hallways behind the school
even in the girls bathroom

the cough medicine problem used to also run rampant in neighboring middle park elementary but they took action riddled their entire town of cough medicine and what we see now is a happier school 100% cough medicine-free

you saw all those people trapped on their roofs
pretty funny dude we did that that was our fault
but theyre trapped now and nobodys helping them
maybe they couldnt get out
dude ah i just ah i dont know what to do here
nothing
dad isnt it possible the flood wasnt caused by global warming i i mean the water was held back by a giant beaver dam after all
mom you know those people in beaverton are still trapped in the flood
kyle it it isnt global warming
global warming isnt happening right now its its not what caused the beaverton flood
because i know what did cause the flood
no
no
no
no
sort of
shh not not exactly we were messing around in this guys new boat and cartman egged me on and and i crashed it into the beaverton dam
look maybe maybe we can help those people in beaverton ourselves
we can sneak out of here get a boat and go help them off their roofs that way i can do the right thing but still lie about it
uh hey dad
dad were were trapped in beaverton were we were trying to save everyone
no dad listen i need to tell you something
nothing can you just come get us please
we have to find a way out
come on weve gotta get to the roof
its- its helicopters they finally came to help everyone
guys come on
stop it stop it first it was terrorists then george bush and global warming and now youre all blaming crab people for something thats very simple its my fault i broke the dam
no i broke the dam
no i broke the dam
i broke the dam i ran a boat into the dam and i broke it
no i broke the fucking dam
i literally broke the dam
on a boat that wasnt mine
i kept it secret for two days
the boat caught on fire and it exploded
ohhh fuck it
yeah us too
what
oh my god how does it know the answer
so what do you suggest
yeah theres just one problem a boy cant go to a chicks slumber party
but if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class the girls will wonder where that boy went
all right butters thats heidis house
yeah dude of course now go the partys already started
maybe they found him out
come on we gotta go check on him
hes just dancing around
come on butters
ho-hold on on guys were not sure what this device is capable of maybe we should wait until weve had more time to study it
guys guys guys stop look at what this thing is doing to us butters was trying to tell me something outside the house that this device is nothing but trouble i think i know what he meant now
we risked everything to get it from the girls how long before the girls attack us to get it back
and then what hide it forever from the government from the terrorists who want to use it for evil maybe maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power
we got it away from the girls thats what matters but now the right thing to do isnt using it ourselves then were no better than they are
nobody will thats the way its suppose to be hit it kenny
oh no dude hes gonna put me with wendy

i cant tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling all i know is that i was depressed before and now i found meaning
neither did i but now if you guys cant accept this great thing i belong to then i suppose were no longer friends
i wrote that um our followers shouldnt fly in dc-8s anymore because theyre too much like xenus evil cruisers
and i wrote that the evil lord xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail
and best of all i wrote that all the scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong
i i realize that to really be a church we cant charge people for help

token my dad wasnt trying to be offensive just forget about it
yeah but he didnt say it in anger or anything like that
hey token i just wanted to let you know that everything is cool now my dad apologized to jesse jackson
well yeah
dude jesse jackson said its okay
he told my dad he was
token hey wait up i just wanted to say i get it now you know after that "little person" talk at that assembly the other day i understand how you feel about somebody saying the n word
god dammit
now look token ive done everything i can to make this right you have no reason to still be mad
im not responsible for what my dad did
what the hell do you want from me
then stop being mad
what was his point
dude i dont get it
wait a minute thats it i dont get it
dont you see kyle i dont get it token i get it now i dont get it ive been trying to say that i understand how you feel but ill never understand ill never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the n word i dont get it
yeah i totally dont get it
come on lets go
whatcha do to butters this time
dude how is putting butters wiener in his mouth getting him
you are now
you cant
because its really really funny
that isnt funny
aw man ive got h o r s now
what the hell are you doing cartman
what do you think happens if you do have it
somebody in this class
you guys stop it this isnt getting us anywhere
yeah or you
why are you saying that kyle you cant be the one who had head lice because i was youre just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out didnt you
you had head lice
dude we totally got let out of school
russian
so hes a hillary clinton fan
do a webcrawler search maybe he has podcasts up somewhere
you should be able to search his username on ebay and see what hes been buying and selling
look these russian guys all have blogs talking about this like its just some big diversion for something much bigger
uh can i ask a question why do we do this
right so why do we color eggs
yeah but why
so we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them
you dont see the missteps in logic with that look im just saying that somewhere between jesus dying on the cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a a gap of information
i dont feel like coloring eggs i dont get it
all right can you explain to me whats going on
what is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that what does that have to do with jesus dying on the cross it is symbolic are you trying to reference something that happened in biblical times answer me
i know that but i figure you must have some knowledge of what easters about if youre playing the easter bunny at the mall
no im not gonna just go with it im gonna find out whats behind all this
mom dad anybody home
dad youve gotta help me
dad theres easter bunnies chasing me
they chased me from the mall i dont know what they want theyre coming in dad open the door dad
why were those other rabbit guys chasing me
does mom know about this
i dont understand
could could you take off the ears please
so what is the secret of easter
grandpas in it too
dad do i have to wear this bag over my head the entire time
you mean the old galveston lodge
must i
hi grandpa
stan
yeah
yeah i wanna know already
where am i supposed to go
jesus christ
oh no
help
my dads in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the hare club for men they protect the secret of easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of snowball
dude they took my dad away they even shot one of his fellow hares and now theyre after me do you know anything about easter what is the connection between jesus and rabbits and colored eggs
please do you know anything about the hare club for men
my dad is in it this rabbit is too somehow
just bread
he was the disciple that jesus made into the first pope
he looks like a guy
but why would jesus want a rabbit to run his church
i dont get it why would the pope be holding my dad hostage for snowball
they found me
if the pope has my dad i have to give him what he wants
what choice do i have theres nobody left who can help us wait unless maybe there is here hold this jesus i know we havent talked in a long time and i know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow but i dont know what to do and i could really use your help
first you have to promise you wont hurt it and that youll let everybody go
okay fine
you said "hand over the bunny"
hey what the hell
jesus you did answer my prayer
no no
snowball
all right jesus
yeah ive learned not to ask questions just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut
uh oh this isnt good

ah shit
you guys this high school musical thing isnt gonna go away i think wed better just get on board with it
i know but i think were really starting to become outcasts at school were losing all our credibility i mean look at who you guys are hanging out with now scott malkinson for christs sake
you can rip on him but you guys are hanging out with him doesnt that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little
that isnt true okay thats totally true but you guys we are at risk of becoming the unpopular kids
god damn it no matter what i do this kid just wont stop and now theyre gonna be in a show together jesus its all over for me theyll probably even have a kissing scene what did i do to deserve this and what am i suppose to do now sooooomeooooones in the kitchen with dinahsomeones in the kitchen i knowsomeones in the kitchen with dinahstrummin on the old banjo and go andfee fie fiddle-e-i-ofee fie fiddle-e-i-o-o-o-ofee fie fiddle-e-i-ostrumming on the old banjo jo jogo tell aunt rhodiego tell aunt rhodiego tell aunt rhodiethe old gray goose ishappy birthday to youhappy birthday to
actually this is high school musical 2 it has a dance-along part
look you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with scott malkinson but im not
scott malkinson has a lisp and diabetes nobodys gonna let him do a musical
look guys the world is changing we cant fight it we have to change with it ive been watching these movies and from the looks of it theres gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school and if you think well gain any respect by ignoring this thing and being individuals then think about this right now everyone thinks butters is way cooler than any of you
thats right you know sometimes you have to go with what your heart tells you theres things were all good at and we just cant keep them bottled up inside cause you gotta do what you wanna dodont let nothin get in your way chase your dream every day true girl you know its truethat if you really wanna be you youve gotta do what you wanna do he was unhappy cause he just wanted to play ball
just like me all i ever wanted was to sing and danceand now that i stood up for my dream i finally have the chance

it seems like everyone has an attitude of "thats just the way they are" or "thats just the way it is" nobody likes it but everybodys too busy to do anything about it
youre not
kenny you dont care about whales and dolphins being slaughtered
you know when all the whales and dolphins in the world are gone people are gonna wish that at some point they had taken a little time to care just a little goddamn bit

would you mind stepping back a little
no- dude we really cant take any more volunteers
oh no no no
oh what so now that i have a hit tv show you guys care about dolphins and whales
i asked you guys to help me and you said no
you said "stan me and kenny dont give two shits about stupid-ass whales"
look if you admit that youre only doing this because you wanna be on tv then ill consider it admit you just wanna be on tv
take us out of port all hands to stations
as soon as we get there weve gotta deploy the tracking device we cant let those whales get hurt

dude are you sitting at your computer i need you to do something for me
mister prime minister japanese officials theres something you need to know the photo you were given of the enola gay was doctored because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they simply pointed the finger at somebody else my government has authorized me to give you the original photo unaltered so you can finally know the truth dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers a chicken and a cow
yeah and they said the weathers gonna be nice like this all day
aww not those guys again
god shut up
god damn it god damn it
all right thanks for coming everyone as you all know the harley problem seems to be getting worse and nobody is willing to do anything about it
now we have some ideas and wed love to hear your ideas and i think together we can- and i think that together we can come up with a way to get rid of these fags once and for all
that makes perfect sense butters
yes now get out of here
alright kyle and i are gonna spray paint messages to the harley riders cartman you said you had an idea
oh thats good
but thats a lot of seats how are you going to pull that off
clyde can you take care of getting kfc for cartman kyle and i will get the spray paint cans if we do this right well be doing the town a huge favor so lets get to it
really nice work guys
yeah we did that
gay people
dude why would we want gay people to get out of town
aw crap
yeah a lot of fags arent gay
do you ride a big loud harley and go up and down the streets ruining everyones nice time
then youre not a fag
i dont know
all right look youre driving in your car okay and youre waiting to make a left at a traffic signal the light turns yellow should be your turn to go but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming and even when the light turns red a guy in a bmw runs the red light so you cant make your left turn what goes through your mind
right but youre not thinkin "oh hes a homosexual" youre thinkin "oh hes an inconsiderate douchebag like a harley rider"
"bike-curious" dont you people keep up with todays lingo at all
isnt this awesome you guys i havent seen a harley for like three days
aw crap
we can fix this
that that lady said its because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary so we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition
ohh it all makes sense now
theres fags everywhere
yes yes sir you are total fags
yeah yeah thats totally what a fag does
but then why are you acting like such fags i dont understand
and that mister editor is why they are the true definition of fags
we did it yeah
today weve made history

"wendy testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"
"or does she"

so then we cant sue him
wow really
how expensive
yeah
so what does that mean
thanks
look it was a gift from my grandpa okay and it cost a lot of money
it happens to be worth six thousand dollars
yeah dude its a recreation of the bolo tie worn by king henry v
i know i really wish if my grandpa wanted to give me something hed just give me the money
no my grandpa gave to me as a present but its worth so much i reel really bad accepting it so i just want the cash
what that cost my grandpa six thousand dollars those are real diamonds on the outside
fifteen bucks
yeah im not gettin taken advantage of
yeah heres one
yeah dude you can test them
this is the same bolo tie worn by king henry v
i wanna see how much youll give me for this gold and turquoise diamond bolo
a six-layer burrito
dude my grandpa paid $6000 for something barely worth anything how how does something like this happen
but how do they get away with that
what are you talking about
grandpa
grandpa
she doesnt like jewelry grandpa
shes not a baby grandpa shes thirteen
yes grandpa
dont worry grandpa im gonna take care of this
yeah hi um you should kill yourself
i said you should kill yourself what you do is sort of unjustifiable and you know its unjustifiable and you dont care youre the definition of evil kill yourself
i just read that the day shopping networks make most of their money is on the day seniors pick up social security checks kill yourself
no i wouldnt
no because i really want you to kill yourself
i dont care what happens to me i care about my grandfather you morally empty corrupted maggot
nono uh it doesnt matter what price you put on anything your only chance to right the wrongs youve done and repay all the elderly people whose lives youve destroyed is to kill yourself
im not joking do it
do you have any idea what it would feel like to start losing your memories no because you dont have someone in your life suffering from alzheimers well i do
yeah well theres an old hindu saying "whoever smelt it dealt it"
you are the scums of the earth old people are victimized by shopping networks and you kick back in your fat-cat mansions making billions
youre not
you should be ashamed of the people in america that you are exploiting how dare you take advantage of those less fortunate
somebody is at the head of all this and somebody needs to pay all i want is some goddamned retribution for my goddamned grandpa no not a diamond-and-gold necklace
oh yeah actually this might kind of work
so the we went to india which is pretty cool i guess ive never been there before and we basically learned that whoever smelt it denied it and rhymed it actually dealt it
yeah i guess so anyway grandpa i wanted to give you something
yeah
cool i i wont wear it anymore
tango tango im in position
it will have to do were not getting closer
i think theyre onto us guys lets do this i got it
go go go
oh thats a good idea
dude we are on the front page
can we get the denver post please
it says oh oh no it says faith hilling is now all like 2000-late
public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé
"faith hilling is pretty stale" said republican candidate newt gingrich "if they had crashed the debate by taylor swifting that would have been impressive"
thats all it is
saying something is so 2000 and anything is so 2009 you stupid ass wipe
well im glad we took care of that
thats a cool idea
what seems pointless
no no no these stupid fads are only that okay we cant give in to this crap

you got nothin better to do than try and knock me down you cant just say anything you want about people
you know what happens when you lie craig you hold that lie inside
and it grows and it grows right in your balls until they have to cut it out
go ahead and test it then lets just see what happens to this money-hungry alcoholic prostitute
yeah
thanks kyle
why does it matter
you know im just im just through with this whole thing i just i cant put my family through any more of this
ugh you know whats really sad that this is what matters to people what nobody seems to remember are the farmers in belarus stanground is bigger than me you wanna tell all those farmers in belarus its all bullcrap
you really think i went through all that trouble lying about my wristband and claiming to be something i wasnt for what kyle for what this is a witch hunt dude its all that stupid french scientist hes the fraud and im gonna prove it
jesus
what are you doing here
jesus everyone is claiming you were using drugs to resurrect why didnt you say anything
yeah ive been kind of seein that
it all just happened so fast the next thing i knew i had a nike commercial
everyone hates me now and it isnt fair
thanks a lot jesus did you take hgh to do your miracles
no pff no thats no okay no and anyway its not even the issue
pff its like thats here and
pff theres theres farmers in belarus who are in a life and death struggle thats what should be important
exactly people dont even know where it is
how can we raise awareness
well we wanted to start a new movement and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets
our scause
dude the hell just happen
people are saying that
wow you know whatever it takes butters people are aware of the problems in belarus maybe i did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence
we did it
are you still on that dude have you ever heard of ends justifying means
its almost like like that guy had this figured out all along
we were trying to do good but we got everyone duped by a bracelet company
well we cant just let that guy get away with taking everyones money
what would jesus do yeheah
wow really thats pretty impressive
but i thought obama won pretty easily last night
i dont understand that stuff at all i need morgan freeman to explain it to me
is that an m&m
pry his mouth open
whatd he say oh well what do you mean the election isnt the biggest thing that happened this week
huh
oh red lobster
hey just one thing morgan freeman how come every time something convoluted needs explaining you show up
theres nothing here kyle
he stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected president
oh my god you guys look dude its boba fetts ship
aw shit its him again
well we tried dude
well i mean look at it this way almost half the country did actually vote for obama if the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes cartman stole then does it matter that much
stan when was the last time you saw somebody drive a hummer
uhhh forever ago like 2010
wow
you guys are watchin murder porn
okaaay
whats up dude
uh yeah the first grader
what
what happened
what
you guys dont need to be watching that stuff
thats impossible are you guys sure you set it up right
what
butters what happened
in minecraft
whattaya mean
its true dude maybe we just need to trust that our parents wont act out what they see
look dude were trying to keep our parents away from graphic television shows this could be a matter of life and death
what dude
so
aha
you have no idea what this is about do you we were using minecraft to block our parents from watching spousal homicide shows
no no just id network a&e oxygen and oprahs network all the ones with murder porn
look can you unpackage them so we only get the channels we want
we want specific networks dropped from our cable
no thats way too long
goddammit i just dont want my parents to murder each other cant you see that all were trying to do is keep our families safe look ah i dont know if seeing couples murder each other on television is gonna make my parents do it and we probably wont be able to stop them from watching what they wanna watch all were trying to do is make it a little more difficult for them because cable makes is so convenient sure if they didnt have easy access to their murder porn channels theyd be bummed out but its not just our responsibility to give them what they want is it
what
i said its not our responsibility to give them what they want
i said it would really bum them out
well then maybe you should go live with jaden smith dad
is he doing it again
cartman are you feeling alright
that sure wasnt much of a zombie apocalypse
he doesnt ever want to play with you anymore
how come youre carrying cartmans stuff
what the fuck
hey kyle
kyle theres peace in the middle east theyre saying maybe its gonna lead to peace all over the world everyones really happy you should be too
dude weve been friends a long time can you just tell me why you like cartmans farts so much
you like how they smell how they taste
theyre really that good
should i try them
kyle maybe you should get some help
i dont get it kenny
well whatever it is we have to figure it out i think all those farts are starting to get to kyles head
kyle dont do this dont eat cartmans farts in front of the whole world
hey kyle
um dude we need to talk this has to stop
if you wanna suck farts kyle thats fine go ahead but you cant suck farts and be a dick about it
all of a sudden you seem to think youre above everyone else
see you sound like a dick
dick thats a dick talking youve had too much of cartmans farts and you got sulphur poisoning and now youre a dick
i dont think kyle really loves cartmans farts theres something else going on
this all started with the stupid peace in the middle east kenny for some reason its making kyle crazy weve gotta get to the bottom of this
yes theres something that you all need to know the truth about the red cow we have all been so- sorry hang on hello
no dude you dont understand cartman hasnt been telling the truth
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
well im not okay with it cause its turned you into a dick kyle
you know i dont think when gandhi starved himself he was all "dude look how fuckin awesome i am for starving check me out"
you should apologize to kenny too
the red cow i saw it too ih it came down from the sky in a flash of light it was a miracle
it is real they do it every year but everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on black friday what chance do we have
the house of greyhawk
i like the ps4s controller better
the ps4 has a touchpad interface you never listened i told you i thought the ps4 was better but you never wanted to listen to me kyle you just had your head so set because because thats how xbox people are
if i see you at the mall kyle i will have to try to beat you inside
we come seeking your help do you side with those wanting xboxes or will you join us on black friday and fight for ps4s
then join us we need people to help us be the first 20 inside the mall
no you cant do that
dont you see this is about more than black friday battle lines are being drawn if you wait it out but everyone else has already decided to go with xbox then that will become the standard the ps4 would be like betamax was to vhs
exactly
look were just asking people who want to play on ps4s to fight for what they believe in
and who do we have on our side
did you ask the vamp kids
there has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side
so were just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on what would they do on game of thrones what would they do when things look their darkest
when we started this fight it was because we were tired of xbox people telling us playstation sucks now we have an army of our own i cant guarantee you will live but i can guarantee that before this is over the winner of the console wars will be decided our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the ps4 all hail the princess
let them pass
the princess bids your fat ass welcome to her kingdom and suggests you state your purpose
the princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that playstations are better shell consider it
the princess calls you a ball-licking lesbian
what i started how dare you
i would rather game with craig than spend one minute having to set up an xbox live account we will get our playstations tomorrow and you buttholes will have nothing
the gods will find us a way
alright guys heres the deal the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers the kids who want xboxes plan to flank from the left here our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the malls back entrance here
the key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the red robin before black friday starts
i have no idea
yes
what
so better a ps4 than nothing is that it i think well take our chances on our own
and you swear youll be okay with that you wont talk about the xbox being better ever again
alright guys looks like we have a wedding to plan
yeah sure what about it
why
oh okay i guess that makes sense but butters and scott wont be able to get their ps4s
who is that
did kyle know about this
did kyle know about this
huh hello who is that
get out of here
you completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had
i didnt even know he was working at the mall kyle
but you couldnt just ask me because xbox people dont care about the truth they just care about seamless multimedia connectivity
you dont understand im never playing call of duty with you again
get out of here im done with you mom mom get him out of here get him out
were done with betrayals its time to put an end to this
i appreciate what youre trying to do kyle but i have a better idea this isnt our war you guys it never was weve been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing thats why they want lines around the block because they want a war to promote their products they dont give a crap what kind of friendships they cost you two want a war so bad then you fucking fight
yay
yes it is
yeah i know what you mean well look guys xbox won the console wars i mean what are we gonna do not play video games
yeah dude she looks amazing clyde sent me her pics she got really hot all of a sudden
oh hey wendy clyde sent me these dont be jel
she looks pretty hot here
hey wendy uh can i ask you a big favor
a lot of the pictures i have of you are kind of outdated and um you know i wanna be able to show everyone how pretty you are
wendy why is it such a big deal
i do
pungent crotch sweat pungent milk- milky crotch spooge
nah
uh huh
angry clit spasm
whooping fart balls
lubricated titty burgers
indifferent rectal semen splooge
dude were not gonna get any attention with that name
no dad we dont need school anymore were forming a startup company

nnnno there isnt
what
im pretty sure thats taken cartman
washington redskins i like it
you alright dude
what
i dont know i but i dont know if my future is with this company either
yeah
i just never saw myself owning a company called "furry balls plopped menacingly on the table inc"
why dont we just call it "untitled startup company"
yeah i know that but a good company should never have seven words in its title
i just feel that somewhere out there theres a perfect startup company name and i need to be free to go find it
good luck with your company dude
it doesnt matter you guys theres something a lot more important here do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together we all had a common goal and we werent gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down but somewhere between starting up and selling out we we lost our way we cant do this on our own we need each other
and we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out
boy this is the life huh guys
but you all thought our name was sweet
morning
hey wendy
yeah the startup company thing didnt work out
so hey i was gonna see if you still wanted to see that stupid maze runner movie-
wendy i thought my life was going in a different direction and i just felt that i i really had to give it everything i had you know i had i had to focus on one thing
huh why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says
for someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on
yeah he said some guy at work is lordes uncle or something
what do you mean we have a friend who needs us right now and we cant let him down

wait wait wait wait whoa whoa what the hell are we doing
no thats not what we set out to do
no we didnt
yeah like one of us is purposefully trying to keep us from digging too deep because theyre afraid
why are you looking at me
think about it you guys from the moment that pc principal took over kyle has been different havent you noticed
hes distracting us either because hes too afraid or because he-
kyle i think its pretty obvious you dont want us investigating pc principal
i dont know

our bikes arent so bad
i thought the four of us were unstoppable
what
how do we get the bike parade cancelled
hey yeah we can go to the mayor and force her to cancel it
yeah
first thing weve gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness
we sure do santa
nononono wait wait wait please
i mean are we supposed to just keep going just go on making total asses of ourselves
yeah what did we think this was a fucking joke the bike parade is offensive and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone
mayor we demand you cancel this bike parade
its him
no
i guess they are offensive
yeah its all right here
yeah i went through it twice people arent ordering as much as last month
what happened to our country people are being wronged by a broken system and we must say "no more" no more homegrown marijuana
as the son of a proud american farmer i am concerned about what homegrown can lead to people can grow weed wrong and poison themselves what
unscrupulous growers could use cheap irrigation and drown babies oh come on
the fact is simple marijuana must be grown with tegridy
tegridy
yeah but dad youre gonna piss off everybody in south park
im writing a song dad
were gonna move back to our old house
aw come on dad
um hi were crimson dawn and um this is a song i wrote about living out in the country on a farm
fate is over open your eyes
there is no hope no second chance all the elders saw the fall of the sky pride and glory to touch the sky weve burned the earth built our own infirmity
you wanna sign us so we can make a record and i can move away from here
biopic you want to make the crimson dawn biopic
uuummm it was about two weeks ago
i hah i hah i hadnt seen my friend kyle and i hate living on a farm so i started writing songs
oh and then kenny learned to play bass watching youtube videos of john lennon with the dalai lama
aw seriously
oh come on thats ridiculous
yeah
this is so awesome you guys our band is gonna be huge
hey whats wrong jimmy
yeah we can get you a liver transplant
how come
no homosexuality were trying to do a band biopic
yeah whats wrong with that
yeah because i hate living on a farm 30 miles out of town
i cant stand my dad anymore and if i want to do death metal i can its a free country
aw come on
but that will take forever
now i know how all the writers in hollywood feel
i cant do it anymore you guys i cant even think with the chinese government censoring everything i write
its so wrong you know i mean we live in a time when the only movies us american kids go see are ones that are approved by china
we just gotta face it a death metal band is never gonna make real money anymore the only band that would get approved by china would be all vanilla and cheesy im gonna have to live on that fucking farm forever
kyle dude youre back
not really we just almost had a biopic made for our band but wait a minute wait vanilla and cheesy ive got it ive got it
cut cut cut this is all wrong
yeah but i cant sell my soul like this i want to get away from that farm more than anything but its not worth living in a world where china controls my countrys art i dont care how many people you have ive got something in me that just wont let me be a part of all this
i wanna be proud of who we are guys and anybody who would betray their ideals just to make money in china isnt worth a lick of spit
dad why are you covered in honey and blood dad did you kill winnie the pooh
im going to go write another song about you
i dont know do like a sale like a fall sale
for halloween i guess so
well it is a little crazy how much you talk about the mummy
like how long is "a long time" could it be years
yes
but if he doesnt get out of it then what happens to us
we will mom you too
how much damage is that
i think nichole and tammy are cool to play with
you mean like nemos war nemos war is sweet
well if you want something hard then you need a really crunchy euro game something like a vital lacerdas escape plan or a uwe rosenburg euro
well all euros are pretty mathy
so then you want a war miniatures game something skirmish-style like legion or blood and plunder
whoa you painted your miniatures
whered you learn to do that
i love bgg
wow

butters butters you gotta calm down
kyle i need to talk to you
im really worried about butters i think hes sick
no its all the other stuff the isolation and the uncertainty im just really worried what all the stuff around covid is doing to some kids you know not every kid is like us theres some kids who really cant take it anymore
and what if hes not what if butters is actually starting to lose his mind what if he feels his body shutting down right now
its time for us to ask for help from someone who has more authority at this school than these cops
uh hi its stan marsh
im sorry we had to get your attention listen were being kept at the school and one of the students here is really sick
nono mr president please you gotta come back to south park our teachers are shooting people everyones arguing and and theres a facility outside of town that found the pangolin and are working on a vaccine you might be able to stop the pandemic

yes
please mr mackey we just want to get our old teacher back for everybody okay can you just tell her were really really sorry

what the hell did i do
i dont see anybody i think were safe here until school starts in the morning
what
i say we take the vaccines ourselves i mean why are us kids last this whole pandemic has been about doing whats best for adults maybe for the broship we do whats best for us
kyle what are you doing
so then why are you replacing some of the vaccines with cactus cooler
i dont want my mom to die either i cant believe that you would lie to me that you would hide shit from me
yeah were gonna go to the school now buddy
im just gonna try and pretend this didnt happen but only because its whats best for kenny
i just want this over with lets get these stupid things to the teachers and go home
we dont have time for this scott
we got to get outta here
and what about you kyle you were the one trying to take vaccines for yourself this morning
look lets just face it you guys we dont trust each other and we dont like each other we cant keep pretending
look its been a hard year and i think for some people theres just no going back
we cant just force things for kennys sake its not good for us and its not good for him
yup
a week is a long time for kenny to be with one person
it would be easier if i just knew i always had kenny on certain days
well i say that out of all of those the first one makes the most sense
2-2-3 thats so ridiculous that it just might work
dude what are you doing youre gonna get yourself killed
okay lets do this
what the fuck is that
hello mrs nelson
well i guess this is it
everythings gonna be okay kenny ill see you on monday
hey i wish you guys all the best huh
after everything weve been through the past couple years theyre gonna take pajama day from us too
what else can we do brah
we can do this
theres only one black kid in my whole class
i do hang out with him
i i dont know
uh hey token
uh listen i uh how you doin
um you think your family would wanna come over for dinner out at our farm
yeah but look token i think maybe you and i should hang out more
i mean we never just hang out you and me
shut up butters look just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner it would mean a lot
i thought your name was "token"
dude my head is reeling youre not gonna believe this
tokens name isnt token its tolkien
no no no no hes named after the guy who wrote the hobbit and stuff
you knew it was tolkien like the writer
no no no no no no no i distinctly remember cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it t-o-k-e-n
wha– hold on a second
dude cartman did you know that tolkien is named after jrr tolkien
then why did you spell it "token" without the "l" or the "i"
uh yeah hang on a second tolk-kien just taking a shit
oh my god i suck
okay i guess
i kinda wanted to talk about something in private
i think i might be horribly racist
so theres this kid at my school and hes black and his parents named him after the guy that wrote lord of the rings
yeah well i-i thought his name was token like– like a black kid thats just there so that like theres a black kid
the whole time ive thought that the whole time
huh
no i was just try–
im sorry
doctor
doctor please i dont want to be like this ill do anything just tell me what to do
okay what should i read
guys lately ive been doing a lot of soul searching ive had to ask myself hard questions because for a long time now ive misinterpreted some amazing writing ive done a lot of reading and ive learned why sauron built the black gate of mordor across the path of cirith grogor which led into the enclosed plain of udun ive learned that the mouth of sauron was once a man who commanded the armies of gorgoroth and dismissed aragorns claim as king
i firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books because if we dont fully know about tolkien then we can make some terrible offensive mistakes in fact did you guys know that our friend tolkien who goes to school here is named after jrr tolkien
my point is we need to petition the school to make tolkien required reading to better understand our classmate i think maybe we all havent done enough to make sure than tolkien doesnt feel isolated and left out
not yet token just another couple minutes
just a couple minutes bro
sup guys you know ive done a lot of reading lately and id like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today jrr tolkien appreciation day these books go so much deeper than the hollywood movies and we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture in fact how many of you knew that our classmate tolkien was named after jrr tolkien but you dont know that lord of the rings was an analogy for world war ii did you and ill bet you didnt know that there was originally 19 rings of power that were forged by celebrimbor so theres much we need to understand and so i would like to bring up the man himself come on up here tolkien come on
nope not any better mom
tolkien is here hey tol-kien
what are you doing here
yeah im good im no im not tolkien i have something i have to tell you
this whole time i thought your name was "token" like the token black person
yeah
i dont know so i understand if you dont wanna be around me anymore
what
oh my god this is great mom dad guess what tolkiens family bought the farm across the street were neighbors
dad
but dad–
yeah i got some right here partner
dude i cant believe we tied that was epic
and you know what else is cool we all have teenagers now
