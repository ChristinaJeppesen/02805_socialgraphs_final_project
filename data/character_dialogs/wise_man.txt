what
your coming was foretold to me youve come to save our people come in watch the cats
me huh no i am just a guide sit down
you must find the answer yourself by taking an inward journey
let the voices of our ancestors show you the way breathe breathe from the bag of visions
i have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life but nothing seems to be working
