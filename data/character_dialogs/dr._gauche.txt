hello boys your mommy has a bacterial infection called c diff its very contagious
all of us have trillions of microscopic critters that grow on and inside our bodies just like your mom theres tiny creatures that live in your moms skin on her eyelashes in her vagina but the good bacteria in mommys tummy are being overrun by bad bacteria we cant use antibiotics because that will kill all the good bacteria too
we need to take a healthy persons microbiome and start to grow it inside your mother we do this with a fecal transplant well get a donors feces mix it with water and put it up your moms anus
your mom is tough kids were gonna do the very best we can kids try not to worry
well young man the truth is we still dont know a lot about the microbiome but you shouldnt let it "freak you out"
yes its possible but we dont know enough there is no superfeces which can make you athletic and young


nothing
weve got more sick incoming try and make some more room we have a major epidemic here detective c diff has spread to half the town we dont have enough staff or enough to supplies to keep up with it
apparently the outbreak started at a restaurant when some women got sick on everybody the women contracted c diff by giving themselves diy fecal transplants
no they got sick from using this a common household turkey baster its a thing most people use just once a year around thanksgiving the rest of the year it just sits in a drawer collecting bacteria and then the ladies went and stuck it up their asses
it gets worse were completely out of healthy donor feces even if we found a donor at this point it wouldnt be enough to give everyone transplants
with how contagious c diff is and how deadly half of south park is going to die
thats good stay still almost there
you ladies are pretty lucky if it hadnt been for these little turd burglars here youd be dead and also responsible for the deaths of countless others
well i think weve all learned something one for the ladies is one too many for the ladies
