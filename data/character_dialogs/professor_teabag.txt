sorry boys its a little late for me to be giving lectures
the keepers the guardians of the secret
come on in
the hare club for men has been around for centuries one of its most famous members was leonardo da vinci behold the last supper the dinner christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified what food do you see on the table
really look to jesuss right the food which is a little different color than the others
yes the egg marks the secret it lies directly in front of saint peter
eggsactly but theres something the church didnt tell you in actuality peter wasnt a man at all saint peter was a rabbit
of course the church wouldnt allow da vinci to paint peter as a rabbit so he painted him as a man but left clues look closely
look closelier
look more closelier with laser technology we can look beneath the paint the way da vinci originally painted it that is saint peter the original pope of christianity
proof is everywhere look at the popes hat it makes no sense except that it was originally designed for a rabbit
because jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion men can be intolerant rabbits are pure but the catholic church buried the truth put a man in charge and the hare club for men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da vincis painting alive
i believe snowball must be a direct descendant of st peter himself and therefor the true heir of the popes throne
boys get out of here head to the woods ill try to buy you some time
