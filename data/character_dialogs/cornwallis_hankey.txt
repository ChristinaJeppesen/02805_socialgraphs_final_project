its not that father its well i dont feel like im really a part of christmas
why were just pieces of crap christmas isnt for us
i see the nativity theres angels shepherds and sheep but no poo all the christmas movies santa elves reindeer no poo im not a part of it
im nothing but crap
but how can i be that giraffe and blade of grass and a human i dont control what they do
i think i see nowim the poo of the antelope that flows down to the ground
