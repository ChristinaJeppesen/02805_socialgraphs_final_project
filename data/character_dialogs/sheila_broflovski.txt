kyle bubbe what are you watching
what is this
its horrible
what did he say
whatwhatwhaaat
oh really is that so
and i myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently i have a clip to demonstrate exactly what i mean
now apparently thats supposed to be funny
not allowing our kids to watch this show is not enough we need to boycott the entire network all those in favor
these boys minds have been tainted by the garbage on television that they see and we are fed up
we have to stop this smut from going on the air we will march to the network and protest until our demands are met new york here we come
we are spreading the word to this establishment that we demand better television for our children
we want more quality television like full house
itll work it has to
hey you will not get away with this
that does it no more mr nice protesters its time for plan b
over there hon what you need to drop some friends off at the pool
the network is not taking us seriously in the past people have had to die for what they believed in and we are prepared to do the same ready
mr mccormick you shall be a martyr to us all god speed we will not let these corporate half-wits ruin our childrens minds launch
we will all follow suit one by one if thats what it takes
here carol i think its your boy
at last now we can return to normality
here they are
but look what they put on
what did he say
whatwhatwhaaat
come on everybody back to new york
mr garrison what the hell do you think youre doing
how dare you include the nativity in a school play dont you realize my son is jewish
so what makes you think he should play joseph of arimathea
our family doesnt celebrate christmas
whatwhatwhaaat youre not going to get away with this mr garrison
how about the dreidel song bubbe
kyle that is enough

that isnt all mayor the school play is doing a nativity scene it isnt being sensitive to the jewish community
kyle sshhh

we cant even leave our homes for fear of our childrens safety
just a little higher
oh hi bubele im glad youre here you can help decorate for the party
to celebrate your little brothers passage into life
its jewish tradition bubbe
oy what is the matter with them
bubbe where have you been dinners been ready for five minutes
how is my little jellybean
okay but first let mommy give you a kiss
aaaaargh omigod make him stop
my baby oh god the horror
ooooohhhhhhooh-ho oooh my baby bubbeleh mine
waagghh
my baby
oh hes dead hes dead my little bubbelehs dead
well bubbe theres something you have to know ike wasnt really your brother he was adopted
what are you talking about
what-what-whaaat
now where did you leave him young man
gerald do something about your smart-ass son
if we dont find him so help me youre gonna be grounded for a month
ike love
excuse me were looking for a two-year-old canadian boy
come on
ike
but first apologize to your brother
hello tom hello patty thanks for coming to ikes bris
look ike its uncle murray
hes been sent to his room for being a bastard hes decided that ike isnt his brother since hes adopted
hello do i know you
ohhh thanks
hello dr schwartz thank you so much for coming all this way to perform ikes bris
right over here
kyle what are you talking about
kyle that is enough ive been reading up on your poor nurses condition and it is nothing to be made fun of its called "conjoined twin myslexia"
now thats just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against sit down boys
you see boys sometimes when babies are born theyre born as twins but sometimes the twins get hooked together and theyre born as siamese twins
but sometimes after the siamese twins are joined together one of the twins dies before birth the living baby is born with the dead baby still attached
sometimes this dead twin is inside the living person so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it
so now that youre educated about her disease you wont need to make fun of her right bubbe
can you imagine that poor poor woman
feeling like an outcast being ridiculed every day
hello
oh yes hello sharon
well sharon i was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia
that does it i must educate the entire town about this awful disease
nothing is pissing me off i just wanta start a movement
i want to talk to you all about your school nurse
no no no im not upset about her i want to make the public aware of her her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of
she has a dead fetus attached to her head
well thats exactly what im talking about this poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast it is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town
i want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening id appreciate it if both you and mr mackey would attend
wonderful
so uhh where did you get your degree nurse gollum
ahhh
gerald
keep your damn mouth shut
please forgive us i-im terribly sorry nurse gollum
i have felt so bad ever since i heard the boys making fun of you--
yes we could get you a few hats and wear a different one every day no big whoop
ive got it we could set aside a whole week to make the public aware of folks just like you
ooooh this is so exciting im gonna get the mayor on the phone right now
dammit kyle weve been working all week against that kind of behavior
shes really touched
yeah the nerve of some people
oy i knew i shouldnt have made kyle eat that gefukahukah
its only a matter of time before theyre selling their bodies and buying smack
bubbeleh you need to get to bed its late
well hurry up
my god i never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness
thats not crazy at all sharon mothers do it all the time
noo no and im pretty sure that strange little boy kenny has the chickenpox right now
how would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend kennys house tonight
i dont understand it hes perfectly healthy
are you sure you stayed over at kennys house
did you sleep in the same room
bubbe how would you like to spend the night at your friend kennys house again
well i think you need to spend more time with your friends
im gonna give mrs mccormick a call
no bubbeleh you play with kenny some more
ive got a great game for you its called "ookie mouth"
first you let kenny spit in your mouth then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time
no no bubbe its loads of fun try it
that ought to take care of it
oh no thank you its terrific though its-- you dont have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water do you
i see well you certainly have aab- humble home mrs mccormick
oh im sorry to hear that
try again bubbe
you know your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers
really i met gerald in college so i didnt know what happened to them
well thats too bad im sure your husbands a fine man
but if they were such good friends it seems silly that they dont even talk anymore lets get them together
well just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something
practice makes perfect bubbe
no i dont understand it dr schwartz hes perfectly healthy
hes been over at kennys house three days in a row and still hasnt caught the chickenpox
i dont know what else to do we sent the other boys over and they all got sick but i cant get my little kyle to catch it
kyle what are you doing there honey
ill call you back dr schwartz
what bubbeleh what is it
oy it was for your own good kyle i wanted you to get chickenpox while you were young
now kyle come here
hoh boy
so how was it did you boys have a good time fishing

well darling i have to tell you something he didnt invite you i set the whole thing up
i thought it would be good for you

kyle eh the problem is
come on ike its time to go to squirts
you have to be in squirts if youre too young to be a jew scout
dont worry kenny ill fill you in on our faith on the way up there
and then kenny abrahams wife bore him no children she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and sarai said unto abraham "behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go into my maid"
abraham begat isaac who the lord then said to kill but that was just a little silly trick to see if abraham would do it
ike you behave
oh my god what is that
this retreat really is out of the way isnt it
im sure they are
good-bye boys kyle and ike you be safe and kenny
try and act jewish

kyle dont say such things
kyle we wanna tell you about the book of job its a story from the bible
he was godly and a good man and fed the poor
but one day satan went up to heaven and talked to god
yes in the book of job satan talks to god and god says to satan "have you seen job he is a great man and he praises me every day"
to which god said "oh yeah ill show you satan ill take those things away from job and he will still praise my name"
then god sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees
job was terribly sad but he fell to his knees and said "the lord giveth and the lord taketh away" and praised gods name
he was in terrible miserable pain all day every day but he still kept his faith
basically
isnt he getting any better doctor
kyle kyle get the doctor

oh kyle kyle youve got to fight
kyles not going to make it stanley oh gerald

but who can we get to build it
what-what-whaaat
oh boys dont ever forget that we love you
oh this is terrible
ike kyle
were sorry kids we just let all those sensationalist news reports go to our heads
kyle i think youve bothered the marshes enough
oh thats so touching
they just believe in their little hearts that it will work we cant tell them it wont we just cant
kyle its just what some people do
oh god this this is horrible
how the hell do you know
oh this is just great how could you two be so careless
not without their parents to put it in a proper context they wont understand what theyre seeing
boys were not mad at you we just wanna talk to you
oh gerald poor kyle must be just as confused and scared as this poor kid
this is awful i just know with every passing minute little kyle is seeing more and more depraved sex acts
hurry hurry
oh kyle youre safe
thats right but sometimes a woman chooses to use other things telephones staplers magazines its because the nerve endings in the vagina are so sensitive its like a fun tickle
its also important that you understand why some people choose to urinate on each other
yeah come on boys time to get home
oh hi boys
thats great were having our book of the month club meeting so why dont you boys go outside and play
kyle you know better than to discriminate against homosexuals
thats right i think its time you kids took a little trip to the museum of tolerance
then its settled boys youre going to tolerance camp
yes you boys dont know how much we suffered
kyle
gerald this is ten dollars a hand
well i dont wanna play here
theres daddy
where have you guys been weve been looking all over
gerald what are you talking about
oh gerald i i cant watch
boys thats ridiculous
my goodness there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days
it is
i dont know sometimes boys take cultural fads too far
kyle what happened to you
what your classmates beat you up for being a jew
gerald gerald get down here
the boys at school beat him up gerald
kyle
kyle dont belittle your own people
well i think we better just go without him kyle its getting late
okay boys get in the car
oh hello chris linda
thats very good of you boys we can postpone casa bonita until next saturday
ill drive you boys
wait up eric we need to stay together uh hold on boys thats my cell phone hello yes oh thats great boys they found butters hes okay
yes eric cartman is with us why oh really
yes i will certainly let him know thank you well it appears that eric here is responsible for butters missing because he wanted to go to casa bonita
eric the south park police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you
smoking
of course they havent because the tobacco companies have gotten to them first this is really their fault
no matter how much money the anti-smoking groups spend the tobacco companies are there to fill our childrens heads with lies and propaganda that make them wanna smoke
we need the help of the greatest anti-smoking celebrity that ever lived rob reiner
so kyle it wasnt the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke
well then you are grounded mister
gerald what the hell is going on
well we wish you all the best mr and mrs gintz but to be honest i think it would be best for ike if you didnt come around again
are you crazy
the new canadian prime minister

no
gerald do something
oh my god
this is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down
whatwhatwhaaat
well our boys have really taken a liking to you you seem to really have a way with them
sharon isnt that your father
oh kyle isnt home right now hon
gerald that is very closed-minded of you you shouldnt judge people who want to change
its very simple you see kyle sometimes a person outside doesnt reflect who they are on the inside
they feel like theyre somebody trapped in another persons body and so they can have a surgery that makes them more into the person they see themselves as do you understand
there you see gerald he totally understands
what
absolutely not kyle
yes but kyle-
kyle you have to accept your body the way it is
the answer is no kyle youre not going to have negroplasty
where are you going
gerald what happened to you
a dolphin
gerald this is crazy
we we need you to take care of them eric theyre out of control
well we can promise not to buy one for kyle but we-we cant make him watch you play th- oh yes fine well force kyle to watch you

new jersey a family from new jersey moved in next to the marshes
oh god poor sharon doesnt she know

that wont work you cant just tell people from jersey you dont like them no matter how obnoxious they are they will convince themselves that you all actually think theyre cool
thats when i knew i had to tell everyone the truth that originally im from jersey yes born and raised i wasnt even called sheila back then in jersey i was known as s-woww tittybang i drank heavily and punched a lot of bitches in the face living in south park im able to control the jersey side of me which doesnt really come out unless i get around other people from jersey im just really hoping that people here dont judge me for it or or somehow you know hold it against me
you wouldnt understand its a jersey thing
kyle you in there
kyle open the door
kyle this instant one two
i guess we need to talk
i know this has to be very upsetting for you kyle
when i got pregnant with you kyle your father and i were living with my parents in newark we knew we had to get out neither of us wanted our child to be from jersey so we moved as far away as we could but now i realize you can take the fetus out of jersey but you cant take jersey out of the fetus
im saying that for the first two months i carried you in my stomach i lived in newark technically you are from jersey
it isnt so bad kyle a lot of people think the jersey look is nice
sharon im so sorry
