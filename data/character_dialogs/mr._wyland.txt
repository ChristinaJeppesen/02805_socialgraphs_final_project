good morning children mr garrison is away today i am your substitute teacher mr wyland
now i understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers but if we all behave and respect each other im sure we can make this a fun and productive day lets start with roll call lets see mmmmm eric cartman
alright and how about stan marsh
okay and where iiiiss… kenny mccormick
alright look why dont we skip roll call heres what were gonna do today ive been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — kyle broflovski
well ive been told that in mr garrisons absence our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for kyle so i got this large piece of poster board and were all gonna come up and use glitterand glue to decorate it
kenny you come and decorate the get-well card too
i dont care get down here and do it
okay children in mr garrisons absence i would like to turn the classs attention to current issues some people think the south park flag should be changed while others believe that changing the flag is wrong i think this is a perfect subject for your debate club
i see that youve already had a lot of interesting debates this year pro-choice vs cartman pro-gun control vs cartman a-and people against the clubbing of baby seals vs cartman and apparently the winner of all your debates so far has been cartman
alright children well unlike mr garrison i want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams tomorrow youll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on
well ive counted up all your secret ballots children and it look like about half of you think the flag should stay and half think the flag should be changed
save it for the debate wendy now im going to assign the debate leaders who wants to lead the "flag should stay the way it is" team
alright stan and kyle you can both be the team leaders for the "flag should stay the way it is" team now who wants to lead the "flag should be changed" team okay wendy and eric can team up
alright children do your homework and lets get ready for a great debate
well i certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club i r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well so perhaps the children can shed some light on us well start with wendy testaburger on the "flag should be changed" team
okay and kyle and stans team your main point
what
