well im impressed and id like to be your manager
scoring a hundred thousand points is amazing but i think with the right label behind you you guys could make a million points
so were in business then
well what do you think
no thats kansas but these boys scored a hundred thousand points to it on expert level in co-op mode
yes you did it boys
all right nice rehearsal boys
that was real cool kids hey kyle theres a different controller in my car that might work better for you why dont you go with jim and hell help you find it
youve got real potential kid i have no doubt you can break a million
i think you could but uh as for your friend well to be honest i think hes holding you back
look you score a lot higher than him theres no question who the better one is i wanna put you with some other players find a partner for you who can really help you max your score
very honorable but you know where loyalty gets you in a game like guitar hero nowhere just listen to that video crowd i havent heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time youve got a chance to score a million points and i hate to see you throw it away because youre worried about your friends feelings
