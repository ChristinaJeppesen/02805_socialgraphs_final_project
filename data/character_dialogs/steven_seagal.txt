youve got a problem with me im your worse nightmare i have no fear of death more important i dont fear life im a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me and then i put a picture of myself up on the internet and i had my shirt off and i said "do you think im ripped" and some people commented saying i didnt look ripped that i was fat and they called me steven se-boom-boom so i put another picture on the internet and i thought people would be stoked on me but they said that i looked like a fat turd and they said i wasnt buff body-shaming isnt cool and if p-people shame you on the inter n-net you have to make sure that you stay you stay strong and tell everyone youre proud of how you look like this
