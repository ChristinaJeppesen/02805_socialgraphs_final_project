thank you so much once in a while i come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life "a million little fibers" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory please welcome author stevem mctowelie steven when i read your book i thought to myself "how can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay"
you talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack what would that do to you emotionally you have been through so much and i think that people all over america could benefit
a life that kept getting up whenever it was down
well steven your book hasnt sold a lot of copies yet but i have some pretty exciting news for you
and so steven im making your book my official book of the month selection
uh huh okay well listen maybe we can get her in as a guest on the 19th all right is john travolta available to be a guest the week after that okay that might work better since its sweeps week
whats the big deal his book helped people why does it matter than he made some stuff up are people really going to be that mad
steven its oprah can you come on my show again tomorrow
we need to tell the audience why you changed some of the facts in your book that you thought it necessary to "heighten" certain things to make the book more relevant to people
just come on the show and explain in a very level-headed way that changing some facts shouldnt matter if the book helps people okay
see you tomorrow
today my guest is once again steven mctowelie whose memoirs many of you purchased after i made it my book of the month selection
now it turns out that your name isnt really steven its towelie correct
and you are a towel
can you explain to the audience why you said you werent a towel before
was it that you thought embellishing the story was okay if it helped people
well you know what i think towelie i think youre a lying sack of shit you lied to all these people and for what to make money they bought your book thinking it was true
how dare you like to me and make me look foolish
you think writing is a joke you stupid towel
you will not get away with this
you lied to me towelie and therefore you have lied to america we are going to rise up against you is this audience ready for a good old-fashioned lynching
audience if you look under your seats youll find your very own torches
