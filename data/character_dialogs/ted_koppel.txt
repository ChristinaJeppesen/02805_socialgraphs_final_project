a new movement is sweeping the country led by four determined boys from south park colorado the organization was created to protect hollywoods classic films from the hands of their directors and also to free hat mccullough so boys i ask you the question thats on everyones minds why does your organization want to free hat mccullough the convicted confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies
well hat mccullough admitted he killed those toddlers why do you want him free
just answer me this tweek what do you see as "positive" about toddler murder
yes it is easy alright then on to your other cause saving films from their directors what got you boys interested in this especially given your pro-toddler-murder status
well im glad you said that boys because joining us now are steven spielberg and george lucas
gentlemen these toddler-murder fans think youre insane and shouldnt be allowed to alter your films your response
how so
