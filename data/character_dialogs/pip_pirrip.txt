oh i rather thought i was
yes i see hoh lovely
joe do you know anything about girls
but do you know anything about them about how they work
do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith
im pip sir
oho but it must be ms havisham
yes sir
good-bye sir
none sir
yes sir thank you sir
mr pocket
thank you kindly you do look rather familiar
my how lovely
oh its quite alright lord bless me why youre the pale young man i saw at ms havishams house
perhaps but perhaps not ms havisham is very generous indeed
well what do you mean
pocket may i ask you a favor i am desperately trying to become a gentleman for the love of a certain girl so will you please tell me if i do something wrong at the table
hoh dear im terribly sorry
sorry sorry
oh excuse me
at half nine the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house
terribly sorry pocket
good evening ms havisham
thanks to you
oh my she is even prettier than before
i dont know i mean i think about her every day
righto
yes but where will i find her
thank you ms havisham for everything im the happiest boy in the land
hello estella
yes ive become a gentleman may i
well i was sent to be schooled in london
oh i see joe once in a while but i dont have much in common with him anymore now that im a gentleman and all
it is wonderful to see you again estella
because i believe im in love with you
i think you do
i see past that estella i see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind
who who is that
i see and you fancy this steve fellow
boyfriend
i dont understand i did everything right i stopped being a poor commoner i even blew off my lovin joe
ms havisham you have to talk to estella shes going out with a-
ms havisham but um
but i dont understand you sent me away to become a gentleman so that i could be with estella
well i suppose that if you set out to break my heart you did a very good job of it because it certainly does hurt
its a-as if sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss squeezing it very tightly
but why do you make your daughter hurt people
joe
ms havisham she has all the men who have had their hearts broken by estella trapped in her house oh why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman
why youre the escaped convict i helped a long time ago
you but why
oh dear all this time i thought it was ms havisham she totally let me believe it
well ive certainly learned a lot that being a gentleman doesnt mean learning to dance or proper table manners it means being a gentle man gentle to everyone
and now i suppose theres only one thing left to do
if ms havisham is determined to do this to others lets go kick her arse
not so fast you ugly ancient bitch
you wont get away with this
pocket get over there and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying
come estella you cant want to be part of this
estella listen to me you are a wonderful girl with a kind heart
but you do and i shall prove it to you once and for all look at this adorable little bunny
you see that a heartless person wouldnt care at all about this bunny theyd just as soon break its neck oh but look at this bunny there you see that you have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies right
nine nine baby bunnies a person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies so you do have too big a heart to- ten baby bunnies
twenty-six baby bunnies
what
there you see you do have a heart
no no im sure of it you have a heart youve bought your own life come with me now
youre released from her now estella now we can begin our life together
theyre not going to pick me i just know theyre not
really i dont believe it
eho yes can i have some tea please
oh very well just some crumpets then
cheeri-o my name is pip i would like to see if you wouldnt mind not smashing our little town to bits haaah
