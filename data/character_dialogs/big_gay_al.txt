so lets all give a big round of applause to little jimmy

oops guess were out of time kids now remember tomorrow you all have bake sales in your respective neighborhoods to raise money well meet back here next tuesday and see who raised the most good luck
hi ya fellas
im super thanks for asking the troops are off having bake sales and im pleased to report that we have already raised over $600 for the event yippie
well stop the presses did you figure that out all by yourselves silly buns
out of scouts
but ive been in scouts since i was nine - its a huge part of my life
i see
what if i promise not to be gay anymore pinky swear
right move on
ah bye scouts okay okay marc stop playing now
im sorry sorry but now ive packed everything away so just well play something uplifting like "im gonna put all this behind me and make it okay" music
oh jesus marc
go away im dead
i cant kids ive been kicked out of scouts
really wull-why
why not
boys theres nothing i can do the scouts dont allow homosexuals
thank you all very much but i dont want this
look i appreciate what you kids did i really do but this isnt what i wanted im proud to be gay and im proud to be in a country where im free to express myself but freedom is a two-way street if im free to express myself then the scouts have to be free to express themselves too i know these men they are good men they are kind men they do what they think is best for kids no matter how wrong we think they might be it isnt right for us to force them to think our way its up to us to persuade and help them see the light not extort them to please dont cut the scouts funding the scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids thats why i love them i will continue to persuade them to change their mind but this is the wrong way to do it so i am hereby dropping my case and allowing the scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club
come on kids lets go get some ice cream
say honey is that the pizza
slave should i leave you two alone
yes
oh thats not true colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage
a new study
and so i said to the guy "you really think im paying that much"
i thought we were past this
fellow homosexuals i believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind we must acknowledge that the words "fag" and "faggot" are never going to disappear theyre simply too much fun for everyone to say but we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot harley riders
we should all be tolerant but not with these fucking people they really are faggots
you can do it boys we believe in you
come on boys you can do it
no one is killing anyone weve had enough you faggots get the hell out of our town
