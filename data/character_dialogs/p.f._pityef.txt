ah i see youre wearing one of our brown scauses already delightful what color would you like your new scause to be
well of course you came for a scause to wear on your paws and you want others to wear yours upon thaurs
hm perhaps i should start from the beginning in the modern age there are those who believethat a cause is a thing to be worn on ones sleeve and so we sell a cause its called a scauseand wearing a scause gets you lots of applause we start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpistthen dip it in colors that show off your purposethere are green scauses for recycling blue scauses for kitties and pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties do you hate abortion ah then a white scause is for you why not champion your scause with some sparkles and gluewe make scauses for this we make scauses for that why theres even a scause for just being fat whats the matter cant think of a scause how about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozzlets just think of the thing that you care about most then lets make it orange like marmalade toastand now id like to say "thank you" for your coming downim off to go sell these in your little town
one at a time please one at a time
not a problem you can return your scause and for just five dollars ill give you two more
absolutely five dollars please
