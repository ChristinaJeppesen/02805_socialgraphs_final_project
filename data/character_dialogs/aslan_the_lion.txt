fellow council these are indeed dark times the evil forces amass at our gates as we speak zeus believes we should evacuate
and what say you morpheus
bring him here
i believe this child was brought into imaginationland for a reason perhaps the mayor knew something we dont
it is a dark time for all of us young boy but know that if you believe in yourself everything will turn out all right
imaginationland used to be a happy place but then the terrorists attacked and so many of us were killed the barrier came down and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed now our final battle will take place the evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out
we prepare for a battle we cannot win sweet and cuddly imaginary characters many who have never held a weapon must now fight for their very lives we are too few in number but we have one hope that is where you come in young boy only you can help us win this battle
you have a power here that you have yet to understand
get everyone to the battlefield defend the castle walls quickly young boy we need your powers now
santa claus was killed in the terrorist attack the first thing we need is for you to bring him back
what are you doing we need santa
believe in santa right now
theres no time left you have to get control of your imagination and bring santa back now
then the day is lost
quickly santa they need you on the battlefield
now you see your potential young creator but there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day
good butters now imagine some more archers on the castle walls
cavity creeps
quickly you must imagine a giant crest gel
project imagination doorway
we can get imaginationland under control the chosen one just needs more time
the boy is doing it everything is going to be okay
the day is ours
