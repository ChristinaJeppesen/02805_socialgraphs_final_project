its a really great thing youre doing we have so many abandoned babies and not enough people like yourself who care
just hold them talk to them play with them youll find theyre so hungry for attention heres our crack baby ward now i know it isnt much but we dont have a lot of funding you see
come come right over here we have a decent room here where you can play with the babies and nurture them its actually really great youre volunteering now because our other little boy volunteer is just finishing up
young eric has been here every day for the past two weeks bless his heart
bye eric
certainly were here all the time unfortunately
isnt it wonderful all the crack babies will have a home now
