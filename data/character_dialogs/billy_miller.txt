hold on hold on youre a big boy eric maybe you can pay me back another way do a little job for me ive got some serious kfc coming in from a dealer i need somebody willing to get a little risky and pick it up
two buckets plus a three-piece meal and four sides
ive got the money to pay for it but its become a risky business out there you get the chicken for me and ill make sure youre hooked up for life do you wanna do it
excellent
cartman my boy you got the stuff
heyyy youre good eric i need people like you
thats alright eric ive got something big in the works what if i told you that i now have a direct line to get all the kfc we want here im sending tommy to kentucky to try and set up a little "arrangement" with the colonel himself
thats right and id like you to go as well and watch tommys back for me is that something youd want to do
excellent
what are you crazy eric making a deal with the colonel for ten thousand more boxes i cant move that much chicken
fine im not making any money here im losing it i have to pay for more security i got the cops up my ass and i have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution
how can i expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you get out there and sell the chicken or get lost youve forgotten who the boss of this operation is eric
