why do we hold the sundance film festival here phyllis its so painfully crowded
no this used to be a quaint little mountain town now look at it sushi restaurants upscale clothes stores $25 parking liam neeson i tell you phyllis i think weve tapped this towns resources out we must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again
this is perfect why didnt we think of it sooner this town still has some charm left not the mess we turned park city into
yes and the town after and the town after that like termites we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up and then move on until every quiet mountain town is like los angeles
because we have to live in la and if we cant live in quiet simple peaceful mountain towns then nobody will
waitwaitwait zoom in to a close-up of my face when i do that ready then nobody will
thats it
