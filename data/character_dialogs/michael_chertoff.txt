ladies and gentlemen our nation and our world is facing an economic and ecological crisis of disastrous proportions im talking of course about peruvian flute bands the red dots indicate where the highest concentrations of peruvian flute bands are all over the world wherever there are tourists or shoppers there are now on average 65 peruvian flute bands per square kilometer general
three countries in asia and seven in europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their peruvian flute bands we will need every resource available to see this through
senator
you heartless bastard this country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity and we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by peruvian flute bands is that clear as director of homeland security i am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained
attention peruvian flute bands
we appreciate your cooperation and patience
tomorrow you will be boarding ships
which will take you to guantanamo bay
translator
there you will spend the rest of your lives
calm down people we still have work to do we have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again
well think about it idiot where else would "peruvian" flute bands come from
the country is in the name
not peruvian retards peru its right here
now i want a plan in place to take out peru once and for all
peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us unless they are stopped at the source
see god damn it
the llama brothers tapas and moodscapes
right you just play pan flute music at the mall and sell cds of you with a llama but youre not a peruvian flute band
which tourist location were they playing at
let me talk to you guys out here well what do you think
i agree theyre obviously some kind of hybrid
well however they came to be theyre about the only piece of good luck weve had
if they are the hybrid were talking about then they could be our way of taking out peru once and for all
all right heres the deal maybe you are on our side and maybe you arent but if you help us well get you home
youre able to walk amongst the peruvian flute bands they see you as one of them we are going to send you to their capital
we still dont know whose side youre on you do this and well know you leave for peru in the morning
you dont have a choice either you go to peru or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands
oh and what might that be
guinea pigs
you were so close to figuring it all out davis did you know that
i really thought you had me in miami but you just couldnt quite put the pieces together
oh this is only the beginning davis and i cant let you interfere sorry my friend but ive worked too hard to make all this happen the pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths the guinea pigs are rising and the only person who could have stopped all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere
what about the pan flute bands are they on their way to guantanamo bay
have they been loaded onto the boats or not
that was an order the pan flute bands were to be put on boats to guantanamo last night i am still in charge here i want those pan flute bands on the boats to guantanamo
and how are the efforts to contain all this going
ah im sorry i just thought of a funny joke
all right get the jets ready i need to get to machu picchu
yes i need to be taken to machu picchu have you lost your hearing
am i in charge or not
wait here a minute behold i am standing on your precious land ive waited a long time for this
what of your prophecy now nothing can stop me craiiig no how did you get here
shoot them
theyre a peruvian band that escaped we must keep them contained
i said shoot them
damn you craiiig you just dont ever stop do you
you see for thousands of years horrid creatures have lived in the guinea valley of peru the incas learned how to keep the creatures at bay by playing pan flute music guinea creatures hate it even more than humans do but the prophecy foretold that one day the creatures would be unleashed and i have made that happen the incas predicted the world would be saved by craig but that part of the prophecy will not come true for you will all die on this mountain
oh im much more than that guinea bees guinea rabbits guineasaurus rexes i am something much more evil arrrgh
dargh no
