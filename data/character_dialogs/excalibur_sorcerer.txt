let me see the stone
ive seen this before stones that were used by the knights of standards and practices
a legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay but they were just a myth
the knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum should a curse word ever be let out they would return a rune for each word of curse was made representing each of the eight words that so offended god
look at this the writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil geldon who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power then all the world will be destroyed
what
then we havent much time we must go
