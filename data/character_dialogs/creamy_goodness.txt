thanks tom it looks like the firework ban wont be putting a damper on one towns festivities tonight im here at starks pond in south park where the crowd of residents and scores of tourists anxiously await the lighting of the largest snake in human history
now as most of you will probably remember snakes are these little round disks that you light and they spew out a little snake of black ash well the south park snake is over half a mile in diameter and twenty stories high im told that this event wont begin until the sun goes down and night is upon us
alrighty then looks like were ready
well were coming up on nine hours and the giant snake of south park shows no signs of stopping residents have tried everything from fire-hoses to yelling at it to make the snake stop but nothing seems to work
