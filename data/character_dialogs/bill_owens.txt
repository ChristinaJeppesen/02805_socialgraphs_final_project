oh jeez i knew this would happen first the gay people come in here wanting equal rights then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it > why do i have to make this decision />
i just wanted a big house and lots of respect i didnt want this kind of responsibility i mean i dont know anything about gay marriage what argument can i use to deny them their right to a family
i cant use that argument theres never been a study done which proves that either way
then i would have something to fall back on so-something to take all the pressure off of me
i believe that i might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy people in the gay community want the same rights as married couples but dissenters dont want the word "marriage" corrupted so how about we let gay people get married but call it something else you homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples but instead of referring to you as "married" you can be butt buddies instead of being "man and wife" youll be butt buddies you wont be "betrothed" youll be butt buddies get it instead of a "bride and groom" youd be butt buddies
y-you are equal its just that instead of getting "engaged" you would be butt buuuddies and everyone is happy
well like anyone cares about fuckin dykes oh god i was sure that would work
today is a very big day in which im supposed to make a very big decision as some of you know my biggest issue with gay marriage regards child-rearing and a new study has just been concluded which will give me the ability to take no personal responsibility in this decision
here with the results of that study is the lovely mrs garrison
this egg is fine gays can get married
