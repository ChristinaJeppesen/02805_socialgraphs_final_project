the universal network heads they say the earthlings have become aware of the show so it wont be funny anymore
everyone can i have your attention real quick uuh look i just got a call from the network and im afraid earth has been canceled
now now it was a great run and i think we should all be really proud lets call in a demolition crew to strike the earth for resources
wouldnt do any good
all right kids well take you to the network heads but i warn you nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made nobody
