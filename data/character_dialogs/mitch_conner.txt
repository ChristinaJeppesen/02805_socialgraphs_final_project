no i dont like a little blood blood aint the stuff for eighteen year old boys from sheboygan blood aint the stuff for mitch conner
and thats that "pack your bags youre headed home hugs and kisses from uncle sam" so how do i end up here with a nine year old kid who just wants to know who his father is life is funny like that one day youre sifting through the guts of some gook in vietnam and the next youre playing dr phil with some kid and his teacher
sorry is a four letter word with a y on the end that doesnt mean anything to this poor kid
yeah the old "hasnt anything changed" speech works on white people all the time
is muhammad more important than a little boys broken heart
look mephesto just tell this kid who his father is and you do it now
you really got yourself in a mess this time kid
you might wanna
