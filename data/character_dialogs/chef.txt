children kenny has been diagnosed with a terminal disease
oh isnt that nice youve got lots of friends dont you kenny
hello there children
hows it goin
yeah things have been better
stan sometimes god takes those closest to us because it makes him feel better about himself he is a very vengeful god stan hes all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago he just cant get over it so he doesnt care who he takes children puppies it dont matter to him so long as it makes us sad do you understand
well look at it this way if you want to make a baby cry first you give it a lollipop then you take it away if you never give it a lollipop to begin with then it would have nothin to cry about thats like god who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears you see its our tears stan that give god his great power
the broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new canadian prime minister what if this christmas instead of buyin presents we all use that money to give to the broflovskis
