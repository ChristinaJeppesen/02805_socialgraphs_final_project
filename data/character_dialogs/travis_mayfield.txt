sometimes i just worry what kind of world our baby is gonna grow up in i need to run up to the forest and do another sediment analysis im worried we might be overworking the tertiary layer
mr president mr president i believe we have a serious problem the environment is changing i believe it is somehow reacting to our presence on it
look this is the world right but now think of the world as a living being if it were somehow conscious then it would ultimately become aware of our effect on it
if we have made too much of an impact then that consciousness would try to snuff us out i think were looking at a global catastrophe the likes of which weve never seen
i think we need to put all resources now into a full investigation perhaps even begin a licewide evacuation
damn you vice president craig you could be killin us all
kelly i was just thinkin about our baby i want to name her hope
hope for a chance at tomorrow
oh my god we have to get out of here
we have to get out of here now kelly
everyone get up into the trees we have to get up high come on kelly

how many survivors
you son of a bitch you had a chance to stop this so help me if we live through this im gonna see you rot in prison
we arent out of this yet you two look for other survivors you get whatever food you can and bring it back here
god did when he killed my wife
this isnt going to stop the world is rejecting us if were gonna live we have to get off this planet
first we have to get out of the forest into the forbidden zone its the only way we might even see another planet
well die here look the world is getting rid of us dont you get it
yes because maybe we rolled the dice too many times
you can all stay here im gonna try to save my baby
not a chance
if we find anything well try to send help for the rest of you lets go come on if youre comin mister vice president
its real real as my love for my unborn baby
our ancestors came here from another world maybe theres still other worlds out there with life forms like us maybe theres even a world where theyve learned to live with the planet instead of just on it

luck had nothin to do with it
