very good well take them from here children enter welcome to your new home before we show you around lets get one thing clear this is a very strict religious household as long as you live here you will be agnostic these are your foster brothers and sisters they are all strict agnostics david do you believe in god
right there are two bedrooms upstairs boys room and girls room your chores are listed on their respective doors follow you will eat only at designated meal times beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like however in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages dr pep-er and diet dr pep-er because what flavor is it it is neither root beer nor cola nobody is sure what flavor it is and nobody can be sure isnt that right melissa
good
what in the name of nobody knows are you doing karen
come on now this is not the way weve told you to tidy up remember cleanliness is next to godliness so make it kind of clean but not too much amanda more ambiguous on the dusting kenneth answer the door
this is where youll sleep with your foster brothers you will be clean polite and most importantly you will follow the agnostic code we cannot know with certainty if god or christ exists they could then again there could be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything can we be certain there isnt no so its pointless to talk about now say it with me
hey we do not take the lords name in vain in this house just in case there is one do you understand or do you need the punishment room
and if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence nobody knows nobody can know if any deity is watching over us amen
what
what have we told you about making up angel stories
get down to the basement all of you its time for the punishment room
now did you see an angel
no you cant be certain of that you mightve seen one hit him with the dr pep-er again are there such things as angels
