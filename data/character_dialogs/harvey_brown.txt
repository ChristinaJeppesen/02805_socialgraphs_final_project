we invented the wall-mart super center in 1987 the idea was simple build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low we didnt know what we were doing in just four years it was out of control
you dont stop it
theres nothing dont you understand nothing can stop the wall-mart in your town unless of course you can find and destroy its heart
every wall-mart has a heart somewhere near the television department destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process
because the wall-mart stops you many have tried kid union leaders nature activists even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the wall-mart and now they are wall-mart shoppers all
it wont work dont you understand it isnt gonna stop until theres nothing but wall-mart left jesus what did we do what did we do boys tell the world im sorry
