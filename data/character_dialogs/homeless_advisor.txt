excuse me i am the top researcher of homeless studies for park county i dont know why more homeless people are showing up in town but i do know that we must be extremely careful if we give them anything there could be more
go away i i dont have any change
yes who are you
oh my god get in here tell me whats going on
jump them
boys boys i dont think you quite understand how the homeless function perhaps you should come downstairs to my laboratory
ive dissected several homeless to see what make them tick their anatomy is shockingly similar to ours see everything is there heart lungs kidneys theyre almost identical to us in every way except for one the homeless can survive solely on change
they feed on our change they need it in order to keep them moving
somehow theyre able to take our change and turn it into nourishment sustenance
but now watch
it has already completely forgotten that ive given it change it just wants more change look over here this one ive kept deprived of change for over three days
its dying
ive learned that the nearby city of evergreen had a homeless problem just before we did and they were able to stop it
oh my god theyre coming in quick kids get out of here you can fit
get to evergreen and find out how they got rid of the homeless ill be all right
sorry to take the easy way out ow oh fuck oww ohhh ah god
