it is natural its natural tonight to feel some disappointment we fought as hard as we could and though we fell short the failure is mine not yours
president obama
i almost thought we were gonna tie for a minute there that would have screwed us
its mccain we did it obama is president
yes we do assemble the rest of the team weve only got ten hours
actually the hard parts just starting
guys weve all known each other a long time had many incredible adventures but this is going to be our greatest feat ever
my friends while the entire country is busy reacting to the election we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history
million
meet the presidential escape tunnel a two-mile long underground passage that runs from the white house to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack the tunnel is only accessible from the oval office and just happens to travel right underneath the smithsonian natural history museum
you get somebody into that tunnel they can blast into the museum let the others in the heist is on
and we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next eight hours
nicely done b were in position outside the smithsonian you find the escape tunnel
hello sarah its mccain
all right here we go
hi michelle
michelle we need you to do a different scan hack through the vault relay
thank you very much
b you cant be serious
i just looove happy endings
