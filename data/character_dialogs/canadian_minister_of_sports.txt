oh its tewwific thats 200000 more american dollars in just one day
ohh terrance & phillip how are canadas two favorite buddies
we thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh
they see through the charade
i think they see through the charade yes
alright fuck it youve seen through the charade so you might as well know everything charade up allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming for years gaming was simple you pay for the game and you enjoy with mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid but if you pay for incentives youre rewarded
its a simple cycle a never-ending loop based on rpgs explore -> collect -> spend -> improve but whereas those just use the concept of xp or experience points weve introduced the idea of micro-paying with money money money money money money money
and so in conclusion the successful premium game is based on five principles entice the player with a simple game loop use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves train the players to spend your fake currency offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
-and make the game about waiting but let the player pay not to wait its a surefire way to make lots of money
no no it has to be just barely fun if the game were too fun then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun
ehhhveryone is doing it
its the way things are going
oh ah what is the matter
hoh non well we certainly wouldnt want that oh i have an idea how about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"
of course the alcohol industry does it all the time
now hold on terrance & philip theres nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game
alright alright youve seen through the charade again let me explain how freemium games really work the truth is a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them its all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them thats how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game thats not even worth forty cents
dont think aboot that think about all the money here have a bump of coke
here is a fact 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics using slot machine tactics freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers
were building a new canada with micropayments from addicts who cares you think the fucking alcohol industry cares they dont care that 10% are gonna get addicted theyre counting on it its the same with us but weve got our eyes on every addicts screen every button they click we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats
hohon im much worse than the devil im the canadian devil
screw that go canada
