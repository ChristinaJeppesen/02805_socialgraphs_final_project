hey if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor

oh oh thats so sweet
thats the s-s-saddest thing ive ever heard
hey randy can i borrow your uh what the hell are they doing
the boys wanna see their dead friend kenny again jimbo so theyre building a ladder to heaven
awwww
kyle i think youve bothered the marshes enough
no its alright sheila the boys were just building a ladder to heaven to see their old friend kenny
a ladder tuh oh oh god
oh thats so touching
tom im standing in south park colorado where last december eight-year-old kenny mccormick died of a terminal illness but now that little boys three closest friends miss their friend so much that they are building a ladder to heaven in order to- a ladder to heaven in order to try to see him again its so sad and yet so beautiful tom heres what some people had to say
well our son just said to us that he really needed to see his little friend kenny again and and that he thought it would work if he built the ladder to heaven
they just believe in their little hearts that it will work we cant tell them it wont we just cant
it shows how beautiful the innocence of a child really is
a ladder to heaven thats fuckin stupid
these boys symbolize how we all feel about loss who are we to tell them its impossible
tom people from all over the- sorry people from all over the country are coming to see the ladder feeling a connection to its symbolism and beauty even country singer alan jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder alan jackson is of course the man who wrote the song "where were you when the world stopped turning" about the tragedies on september 11 and now hes here once again to capitalize on peoples emotions lets listen in
where were you when they built the ladder to heavendid it make you feel like cryin or did you think it was kind of gay
what a beautiful song
well i for one believe in the ladder to heavenoh yeah yeah yeah 9-11i said 9-11 9-11 9-11 ni-hi hi-hine___eleventhank you i have a new cd out with all my 9-11 songs for sale right here

the nation is rallying behind three sweet boys in colorado who are building a ladder to heaven to be with their dead friend its making americans start to believe in heaven again
well when i see how this ladder has brought people together how how it has changed america i mean how can i not believe
ha do you actually believe in the ladder to heaven
if heaven is an eight-year-old boy and the ladder is my penis and the pearly gates are the-
uh meanwhile the american economy cont- wait wait wait a minute we are getting reports now that japan is building their own ladder to heaven to compete with the uss lets go live to snn correspondent nobuhiro sabasurisurijuwa
this is a nobunaga hiroichi reporting rive from tokyo where japan has started buirding its own radder to hayben ahready the japanese radder extend faaar into space and its growing by a-one thousand miles every day as the endeavor continues it is becoming clear that japan will reach a-hayben before the united states
nahurabo nahurabo
excuse me excuse me uh we ran out of stuff we ran out of stuff to build the ladder with
oh no
oh jesus no
where were you when they ran out of stuff to build the ladder to heaven
we can keep going but we need to start tearing down houses for wood
no agh look i i think maybe this has gone on far enough
yeah ih its time we told the boys the truth that they arent really going to get to heaven
wait look
weve come to help you beat those japs boys there wont be anyone stopping this great ladder from being built today alpha team get that support structure up ciranoms team get us photos and recon
yes sir
where were you when they saved that ladder to heaven
man i cant believe how much people want us to get our winning ticket back
candy-shopping sprees have that effect on people kyle
do you see anything
no hello kenny god
grandma
aw dont tell me we havent even reached the cloud city yet
no cloud city not even a giant heaven must still be a long way off
alright look i didnt wanna have to say this but i think maybe were not seeing heaven because one of us doesnt believe in it enough
huh
heaven could be like the pixie faeries of bubble yum forest you only see them if you really believe in them
what
you know maybe were not seeing heaven because one of us is a j-o-o
what does me being a jew have to do with anything
because jews dont believe in heaven
yes we do just not the christian heaven
right your idea of heaven is getting five dollars off your matzah ball soup at barneys beanery by lying about a hair in it
haahh
ah
hey kenny
hey kenny
(we can watch it at my house)
in the ghetto in the ghetto hes a boy wearing orange whos losing his pride cause kenny and his whole family reside in the ghetto in the ghetto
(shut up cartman you blood-belching vagina)
what did you say
(i said shut up cartman you blood-belching vagina)
what did you say
i said "shut up cartman you blood-belching vagina" did i just call myself a blood-belching vagina
dude what the hell is wrong with you
i dunno i just i keep feeling like im kenny seeing memories through his eyes
youre too fat to be kenny
youre a- stupid jew
lets just keep building we only have five more days until the shopping spree
alright hows the ladder going general are we beating the japanese
not quite but we have a new problem mr president our recon team on the ladder just found new evidence of threats from saddam hussein
saddam hussein but we killed him we secretly took him out months ago
yes sir and now we believe hes building weapons of mass destruction in heaven
dear christ that sonofabitch just doesnt stop
these surveillance photos were taken atop the ladder of what appears to be heaven here we see what we believe to be a missile silo and here we see what looks like a laboratory of some sort for making chemical weapons
that kinda looks like a seagull
yes it could be a laboratory disguised as a seagull
that tricky bastard
sir you must understand our fears we must take out those facilities we must bomb heaven
snn question of the day now that americans believe in heaven should we bomb it the polls right now show that 51% of americans think saddam has to be dealt with while 49% are wimpy tree-hugging pussies
war is not my voice this country is just run by rednecks and bumpkins with their guns
we have to take saddam out to protect ourselves
i for one believe that if saddam hussein were an eight-year-old boy and my penis were the united states then there would- hard nipples
god-damnit
tom its been five days since three sweet boys set out to build a ladder to heaven and capture the nations hearts theyve made a nation believe heaven might be up there and it could prove to be a threat to our country president bush will seek un approval for military action
boys its really neat that you want to see your old pal kenny so much but
but its time for you to get back to school and on with your lives
no we have to see kenny
you have to understand that kennys body isnt up in the clouds he was cremated
cremated whats that
when you die your body is put into a broiling oven and cooked until youre nothing but ashes
what for gods sake why
kyle its just what some people do
are you gonna burn me
kyle thats not the issue right now
jesus christ
the persons ashes are put into an urn and thats where kennys body is
you see boys kenny is in here what the wait a minute this is kitty litter
alright alright i drank the chocolate milk mix and replaced it with kitty litter
you what
dude dont you know what this means you drank kenny
shut up
you did dude you drank his whole body
shut up
oh my god this is awful and disgusting
bad eric bad
that explains it why im having kennys memories all the time his soul is inside me
well so much for our winning ticket cartman probably drank that with the rest of kenny
yeah good job fatass
i cant live like this i i have to find a place where they remove living souls from your body
looks like ive come to the right place
can i help you
yes hello i have a living thing inside of me that i need sucked out please
youll have to make an appointment the charge is two hundred and thirty dollars
two hundred and thirty dollars i just want you to vacuum him out of me and not put him up in a condominium
its gonna be okay babe
listen lady youve got to get this crap out of me i dont want him in me anymore just suck him up and throw him out
oh steven i cant go through with this i have to keep it
damnit damnit thanks a lot kid
eh
cartman
stan
kyle
lolly
stan
cartman
kyle
kenny
cartman
the ticket kenny didnt have it on him when he died he put it away somewhere dont you see i can still have my candy shopping spree oh my god you guys you guys
ladies and gentlemen of the un we have evidence that saddam hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction we have tried to communicate with saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven but he has not "re-spond-ed"
of course he has not responded because hes dead
right dead and in heaven
this is preposterous even if there was a heaven what makes you think saddam husseins soul would be sent there
our intelligence tells us that when saddam was originally killed his soul actually went to hell but while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with satan the prince of darkness satan however decided he didnt want to be with hussein anymore and broke up with him around august when saddam became jealous and tried to kill satans new lover chris satan had saddam sent to heaven to live with mormons as a punishment questions yes
are you high or just incredibly stupid
i assure you i am not high
you guys you guys i saw the ticket
what do you mean fatass
i just had another vision you buttholes kenny didnt keep the ticket with him he put it away somewhere
where
i dont know i got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic and i clearly saw kenny putting the ticket in a little red box i just have to wait for another vision to come i could clearly see through ken- ay
do you see anything
yes kyle i see a dead jew
whoawhoawhoa maybe kyles right we gotta spark the vision somehow
not by giving me brain damage
do you want a candy shopping spree or not
alright go ahead ay no ay
randy gerald we we were wrong about heaven the japanese just reached it with their ladder
what
see for yourself
this is a nobunaga hiroichi reporting rive from hayben the great a-nation of japan reached a-hayben today about eight ocrock pacific standard time-eh therefore hayben is now a-decrared an official part of japan because we got a-here first and now for the weather in heaben lets go to natsako semu
todeh weather in hebon partry croudy
thats the news from heben dame dame da bakayarou da
oh god and we told our boys theyd never reach heaven
kids
good as soon as the boys finish their ladder well be ready to take saddam out
do you really think this is a good idea randy
if saddam is building weapons we have to stop him with our weapons
ah excuse me everyone uh were not working on the ladder anymore thank you were done
dude
not working on the ladder but the japanese wont let us use theirs
kenny didnt have the ticket stub it was in his room so we got all our candy and you can all go home
wait are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy
ive never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before
but what about your lost friend what about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven
yeah well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels
yeah but now we think maybe heaven isnt a place you can get to maybe heaven is just an idea a frame of mind or or something gay like that maybe heaven is this moment right now
so youre saying we should bomb this moment right now right johnson
sir
no no we shouldnt bomb anybody these boys are right the only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth now we should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to create it
awwww
and i was dumb enough to believe saddam could actually be up there buildin bombs
where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea n you couldnt you couldnt really get there you little bastards ruined my latest song
well im sure glad this is all over with lets go count our candy
yeah but what about kenny his soul is still in cartmans body
no no i just drank his memories im not sharing my body with that poor piece of crap stop calling me poor you fat dick oh jesus christ
whoa kenny you in there
stop it where am i you guys oh god
dude come back here
stop him kenny
keep those nitrogen capsules over there by the warheads right chop-chop come on
saddam ive been hearing rumors that youre secretly building weapons of mass destruction up here
weapons of mass destruction nooo this is a chocolate chip factory see
it looks like a chemical weapons plant
look god if i was gonna secretly build a chemical weapons plant i wouldnt make it look like a chemical weapons plant would i id make it look like a chocolate chip factory or something
alright just checking
stupid asshole
