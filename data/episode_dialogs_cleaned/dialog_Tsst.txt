mrs cartman we have had it with your son's behavior mkay little billy turner is now being treated at the hospital
eric why would you do such a thing
i'm sorry i handcuffed billy turner's ankle to the school flagpole
you know that's not the point
okay i'm sorry i handcuffed billy turner's ankle to a flagpole and then gave him a hacksaw and then told him i had poisoned his lunch milk and that the only way he could get to the antidote in time would be to saw through his leg
that's very naughty eric
well he called me chubby
we have tried at this school to make eric understand that there are boundaries mkay but frankly we believe his behavioral problems start at home
'''' i know i know he's out of control but you don't know what it's like '''' i'm sorry it's just that he seems to get worse every day '''' he just never listens
well nice goin' asshole you made my mom cry
it's not him it's ''you'' eric '''' i don't know what to do with you
sure you do you're a great mom''who's got the greatest mom in the worldi dooomy mom is number one in my heartit's true''
''my mom's the best mom better than your momit's singing together in harmony''
mrs cartman i know this is extremely difficult but there is help out there for people like you have you ever heard of a show called ''nanny 911''
they're every parent's worst nightmare ''''
'''' shut up i hate you i hate you ''''
kids completely out of control ''''
'''' look i'm skating i'm skating
it's time to call nanny 911 '''' we've gathered a team of world-class nannies to help families in crisis '''' parents of america help is on the way '''' tonight
'''' mom i need another energy drink ''''
this eight year old son of a single parent just won't behave
'''' wir m√ºssen die juden ausrotten ''''
and nanny stella is selected to set him straight ''''
it's time for nanny stella to show eric cartman his ways are ''not'' going to be tolerated anymore ''''
mom are you deaf somebody's at the door
'''' yes i think it's the nanny poopsiekins
killer i'm gonna be on tv now ''''
'''' hello i'm nanny stella
oh thank you so much for coming please come in ''''
and you must be eric
mom i want a twinkie

'''' ha hahahahahaha
i'm serious let's put down the video game and go to the kitchen
'''' no thanks i'd rather naught
right then i'm going to have to take it ''''
the hell do you think you're doing
come on '''' this video game is going right here on the counter until we've done some chores now first thing we're going to do is make your bed '''' eric no this is not acceptable ''''
stop trying to bogart my xbox you fat bitch
all right that's it '''' you're going to time-out ''''
time out
'''' whenever you are naughty eric you are going to sit on this stool for five minutes
'''' and what exactly keeps me on the stool
it's the time-out stool you can't get down until the time is up
'''' whoa how did i do that ''''
eric you have to stay in time-out
ummm no
'''' come on you don't have a choice
all right seriously you're starting to piss me off now
'''' eric you need to listen to me '''' this is very important i am getting down to eye level with eric so that i can talk to him on his level '''' eric you need to understand ''why'' you are being punished all right
i'm just gonna get down as soon as you move
well then i'll just have to stand ''right here'' '''' oh '''' he spit in my mouth
yeah it's best to avoid his level
all right i've dealt with this before we just need to use psychology on him
'' don't stop believing hold on to that feeling''
'''' eric can i just talk to you for a quick second why are you so angry
because you took my xbox
is this about more than your video game are you feeling angry at me because you think i'm here to change your life
well yeah
and you're feeling like i have no right to come in and tell ''you'' how to live
yeah i guess so
'''' see this you have to take the time to talk to your children about their feelings what else are you feeling eric
well i'm feeling confused because i don't understand why you became a nanny
me well it's because i love children like you
right but if you love children so much how come you're not a mommy
oh i just never had kids
why not
it just didn't happen
you're sterile is that it '''' no that's too convenient of an excuse the truth is nobody ever wanted to have babies with you isn't that it '''' always the mom's maid and never the mom must be hard on you knowing that the years are ticking away your friends all getting married and all the while your uterus is slowly shriveling away drying up becoming totally worthless
why you you '''' you little bastard how dare you
eric naughty
what kind of '''' monster would-
yes let the anger come strike me down while you can but it won't make your dried-up ovaries any more fertile ''''
that's it '''' i'm not doing this
oh but we really need some help ''''
find yourself another nanny television show
coming up next it's super nanny where other nannies fail nanny jo comes through ''''
this child's behavior is totally unacceptable
well there's no trial too tough for super nanny in just three days' time you're going to see a new eric cartman
i'm afraid super nanny is in a deep state of mental psychosis
what do you mean
i mean '''' she spends most of her time sobbing and eating her own excrement ''''
'''' from heeell it's from heeell
oh dear i don't know what else to do about my son's behavioral problems we've been through every nanny reality show on television
well there is one more show you could still try
when good dogs go bad there's one man who's their best friend cesar millan
no dog is too much for me to handle i rehabilitate dogs i train people i am the dog wheesperer
please come in
so tell me what are the problems you are having with the child
well he's just out of control i mean he never listens to me and he pretty much runs my life
so the child needs to learn that he's not the most important person in the house
you can stop talkin' behind my back i'm right here fruitcake
see i'm not looking at the child i'm not acknowledging the child i'm just letting the child know i'm not interested in him
not interested in me
see the child thinks your world revolves around him because it does because everything he does gets a response from you
yeah well i don't see why-
'''' tsst
hey
don't look at the child just keep looking at me let let him know we are having a conversation
mom this guy doesn't-
'''' tsst
ah quit it
what what is it that you're doing
dogs show their dominance by nipping each other on the neck but it works equally well on a child i just use two fingers nip at the child's neck doesn't hurt the child just let him know i am dominant
look mexican if you really think that you can-
'''' tsst
knock it off
'''' tsst see i'm not validating his bad behavior with either negative or positive response
oh that's very interesting
i think the first thing we need to work on is getting the child some exercise he's fat and he has all this pent-up energy that-
i'm not fat
'''' tsst -we need to let him burn off do you take walks with your son
well no i don't
go on take your son for a walk
ey you think this is funny you sonofabitch
see once again i am the one going for a walk it's about me the child is lucky to come along
mom this is degrading
'''' tsst
agh goddamnit aaarrgh ''''
don't look at him just look straight ahead and he'll run out of evergy soon ''''
maaaa mommm '''' mommm
here why don't you try it now take your son ''''
mom seriously people are seeing me
good just keep your confidence shoulders back eyes straight ahead the child can pick up on that confidence learning he's supposed to follow you not lead you
mom don't you love me can't you see i'm unhappy right now
'''' tsst ''''
mom
good ms cartman very good
and now back to the dog whisperer
it is important to understand that dogs run in packs and one dog is always dominant the pack leader
'''' god dammit stop ignoring me
you must assert yourself as pack leader with dominant energy
ahall right
this is abuse i am a child and i am entitled to attention
'''' tsst
quit it mom
it doesn't seem to work as well when i do it
okay let me show you how to express the dominant energy what i have done is i have brought over some kentucky fried chicken ''''
ooo colonel
i am going to eat first because that is what the pack leader does ''''
give give me the chicken g-give me some chicken
'''' tsst
eh what are you doing i want chicken give me some goddamned chicken
i am not going to acknowledge the child's attempt at aggressive dominant behavior now you eat the chicken ''''
mom gimme give me some chicken i want some chicken mom
we won't reward him until he's in a calm submissive behavior
'''' goddammit i am not a dog '''' give me the chicken give give give me the chicken i want the chicken chicken '''' give me the chicken give me the chicken give me the chicken give me the chicken
'''' we need him to become relaxed and submissive
gih- '''' okay i'm fine i'm cool now may i have some chicken please
oh very good sweetie
oh no now he's lying you can tell from his stance he's still aggressive-dominant
suck my asshole taco vendor
see
goddamnit you can't stand here and eat kfc in front of me '''' now hand it over
'''' tsst
you can't do that to me i-
'''' tsst ''''
goddamnit you just can't-
'''' tsst ''''
seriously ey eh ''''
i am not being aggressive i am being dominant
wow i have a lot to learn
'''' mom i am serious this has gone on long enough get that guy out of here and give me a piece of chicken '''' that's how you want it bitch fine '''' i hate you i'm running away
oh dear ''''
it's okay this is all part of the dominance struggle
but what if he ''does'' run away
let him go he'll be back this a good opportunity for you to relax and enjoy your favorite hobby ''''
'''' oh boy park avenue i'm rich ''''
hey guys i've got some pretty big news '''' i ran away from home yeah my mom just doesn't care about me anymore so i moved out she didn't even try to stop me it's gonna be tough livin' on my own but i'll get by somehow
'''' you can't stay here
maybe you didn't hear me i ran away i don't have anywhere to sleep i'm out on the street

'''' goddammit '''' craig dude i ran away from home you're the first person i came to i knew you'd take me in off the streets

this is bullcrap mom'll break soon i can outlast her
all right i'm back
oh eric i'm so happy you're home
yes well hopefully you've learned your lesson i've come back but there's going to be some changes around here
look what i did eric i learned how to make sumie paintings i had almost forgotten how artistic i was
that's super-interesting but i've been out living in the streets for almost four hours make me something to eat
cesar
how is the painting going
aw goddammit
oh look it came back
yup just like you said he would
what is he still doing here
he said he's hungry what should i do
well let's feed it
what the hell is this skinless chicken boiled vegetables and salad this is just like auschwitz
this is more aggressive-dominant behavior don't nurture it
oh my god bite-size snickers that's it i'm calling child-protective services ''''
come on ms cartman you must become pack leader what do you do
eric if you don't want to eat then why don't you go brush your teeth and go to bed
nooo you're asking him a favor don't ask a favor ''dominate'' ''''
mom i want this guy out of here you got it if he's not gone in two minutes i will call social services on you
you project the dominant energy and he ''will'' pick up on it i promise shoulder back head high don't reason with it don't argue with it just dominate it
i am your son and you ''will listen'' to me you have no right to-
'''' tsst
mon know it off i'm not gonna stand for th-
'''' tsst ''''
seriously mom-
'''' tsst
seriously why are you doing this-
'''' tsst ''''
mom
'''' tsst
mom mom
'''' i did it ''''
you see you're calm assertive and in control ''''
oh oh my gosh
see this is the behavior we've been looking for this is a relaxed submissive state
he's never done this before
good now you can reward the behavior with praise and attention
i love you very much poopsiekins you're mommy's sunshine ''''
now you can give him a snack '''' good this is really good now try a command
eric i want you to go upstairs and brush your teeth then i'll be up to read you a story before bed '''' oh my goodness i can't believe it
this is a great first step but you're gonna have to stay firm and confident you are the pack leader now
i am the pack leader ''''
now before you go read your son his story let's go enjoy a nice quiet cup of tea
sounds divine
who does she think she is telling me to go brush my teeth '''' jesus what's happening to me
so how is your son doing ms cartman
oh he's been amazing cesar he got an a on his last spelling test and a b+ in history he's losing weight and he's doing what i tell him
that's greeat
the best part is i'm not letting him boss me around anymore i could have ''never'' come out and have a nice lunch on a saturday afternoon with a friend before
good ms cartman sounds like you're treating your son like a son and not like a friend
there's just one problem he still fights me every step of the way i feel like he's ''doing'' what i tell him but that inside he's still the same angry spoiled child
don't worry when you correct the behavior eventually you will see a change in the personality
oh cesar i'm so happy to have you in my life ''''
guys listen up i really need your help this time i've thought about it a lot and i've decided i have to kill my mom
kill your mom
she doesn't let me wear whatever i want anymore things have really gotten out of hand my mom must die so i can have a place to live but without her trying to run my life she's like hitler with all the demands she makes
dude have you lost more weight
yes i've lost almost ten pounds now you see what i mean i totally know how it felt to be a jew in the holocaust now i have to kill my mom it's my only way out
dude don't kill your mom that's not cool
she's hitler would you have killed hitler if you had the chance '''' all right now here's the plan at 945 tonight i will sneak out of my room and leave the house leaving the back door unlocked '''' you guys come into the house at 1030 pm sharp having given me enough time to get down to perkins to be seen by everyone there and then all four of you go upstairs to kill my mom
dude we're not killing your mom
well i can't kill her i'm too obvious a suspect now when you reach her room butters will keep a lookout while kenny opens the bedroom door kyle puts a pillow over my mom's head and stan shoots her in the face
where am i supposed to get a gun
well i don't know that's your job stan do i have to think of everything here
i'm not shooting anybody
okay fine butters you cover my mom's head with a pillow and kyle can shoot her in the face
no cartman
oh well how about i do everything how does that sound i'll just do everything while you guys sit here and play video games '''' fine i'll do it by myself
you forced me to do this you couldn't just love me as a son '''' you just had to humiliate and degrade me with your rules i won't let you dominate my life anymore '''' goodbye mother ''''
wait maybe i don't have the right to kill my mom
'''' no she's my mom i can do whatever i want with her it's more important that i live the way i want
she isn't an object you can own she's a human being
she isn't an object i can own sh-she's a human being
no she's just out to make you suffer
ugh eh maybe all these changes ''are'' good for me maybe
the world doesn't revolve around me
'''' maybe the world doesn't revolve around me ''''
the world doesn't revolve around me
idiot ''''
why eric you made your own breakfast
yeah mom it's okay it's grapefruit and lean ham
and you're studying before school

'''' oh eric i'm very proud of you
tha thank you
i love you sweetie
'k mom you're embarrassing me jeez ''''
cesar i'm so happy you're back
how is the child doing
oh he's amazing i think the change in personality happened he's doing things for himself now and he seems to be accepting it i've lost a best friend but i've gained a son
that's much healthier for him and when he gets older he'll be able to be your friend too
you're the best cesar and to show my gratitude i've got two tickets for you and me to see ''madame butterfly'' this friday night
well no my work is done i've got to get back to los angeles
oh but i thought we were becoming friends

i cleared up the table mom i'm gonna go upstairs and make my bed now ''''
eric how would you like to go with me to see ''madame butterfly'' friday night
no that's okay besides i told stan and kyle we could work on our science project then
