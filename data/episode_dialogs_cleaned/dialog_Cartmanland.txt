frank
sshhhh it aint right chris the truth is the park is a financial flop i havent turned a profit in years because i cant keep attendance up
oh but im not buying the park to get people to come
you youre not
no no im buying it to keep people out dont you see forever it has been my dream to have my very own theme park so that i could be alone in it all day every day i love theme parks but the lines everywhere you go people crowds the rides are great but all the lines lines lines if theres one thing i hate all the lines lines lines lines and then there get to be so many people that they make fastpass so then theres lines for fastpass you stand in line to get a ticket to stand in line later then theres lines for the bathrooms lines for the drinks lines for cantakuras and rare kartankulas plinks and so you see this park is for me nobody else will be allowed in it
nn-oh well then i guess i dont feel bad
mr cartman congratulations the theme park is yours
gentlemen i thank you
kyle dude what are you doing here everybodys looking for you kyle
do you know what happened to me this morning stan this morning i woke up and felt a sharp pain in my ass i felt down there and and found this big sore lump on my ass stan i couldnt even sit down so i i had to tell my mother which which was humiliating she took me to the doctor which was more humiliating a- a- nd he told me i-i have a hemorrhoid its like an infected blood vessel on your ass im nine years old and i have a hemorrhoid stan i have a hemorrhoid and cartman has his own theme park
kyle i i understand what you mean but--
do you do you stan because all my life i was raised to believe in jehovah to believe that we should all behave a certain way and good things will come to us i make mistakes but every week i try to better myself im always saying "you know i learned something today" and what does this so-called god give me in return a hemorrhoid he doesnt make sense what is your logic ow
look cartman he thinks hes gonna be happy because he has his own amusement park but hes gonna find out that without other people the rides are totally lame i mean who could really have fun by themselves at a theme park ill bet hes sick of it already

so what does does this job pay
alright now this is very hard for me to do you understand but in return for you working security ill let you ride two rides a day but only two rides and only if im not on them
uh im afraid i dont really like rides
but you can ride anything you want and you dont have to wait in line
im not interested
dude are you from mars or something any ride you want no lines
if you need security i need a cash salary
but i dont have any cash i spent everything on this park
well look why dont you just let a couple of people in each day every day you can just let two people in charge $2995 per ticket and then you can use that to pay my daily salary
ugh two people
this place is huge youll never notice two people and then youll have security for your park
well all alright goddamnit ill open the park to two people each day but remember anybody else you see trespassing the park
i will shoot on sight
sweet
youre a very lucky little boy ive never seen a hemorrhoid so infected it could have killed you
lucky
oh look kyle your little friend stan is here to see you
dude are you okay
oh im swell stan i popped my hemorrhoid trying to climb the fence into cartmanland and it got infected i really need to go to the bathroom but if i do it will pop again and the pain will make me pass out how are you
well um ah-i found out that cartman is letting a few people each day into his theme park i was thinking we could put on disguises and get in
ah-ah-ah-im afraid kyle cant ride any amusement park rides for over a year because of his horrible hemorrhoid
jesus
but its okay stan because i finally figured it out you see if someone like cartman can get a million dollars and his own theme park then there is no god theres no god dude
kyle dont say such things
why why mom because if i do something bad will happen to me because if i do your god might not shower me with his blessings of infected hemorrhoids
kyle y-you-you just dont understand its--
no i finally do understand there is no justice there is no god do you hear me i renounce my faith
alright alright listen up people cartmanland is open but only to two people each day
aw
thats gay
i just gotta cover my security expenses butters clyde you can come in

yeah but i think its broke down the cars arent moving
ugh alright alright hang on security
what
oh jesus uh look the haunted house ride broke down i need you to fix it
uh im security not maintenance
but i dont know how it works
well your rides are gonna break down every now and then you need to hire a maintenance person
ogh alright alright ill let two more people in each day so i can hire a maintenance person
alright folks weve had another change in policy ive had to hire a maintenance person and to pay his salary i have to let in two more people a day however the stupid maintenance worker demanded i have food and drinks inside the park so now ive had to hire a beverage person and a cotton-candy person which means i now have to let eight people come in a day but you are to try your best not to ride any rides that i am on understood alright lets go
timmay
wait a minute who are you
mike gainor
ha get the hell out of here stan
goddamnit cartman let me in
i thought you said buying a theme park was stupid security
it is stupid cartman you made kyle lose his faith in god you fat asshole
get him out of here
move along sir
aggh this isnt over cartman
eugh well now i can finally get back to my riding my rides uh oh oh man im so scared aaaggghhh
agh agghh
just a little more there we go
hello kyle hows the hemorrhoid today
awesome
kyle we wanna tell you about the book of job its a story from the bible
ive had enough of the bible what has it gotten me
oh i think youll see differently after hearing this sit down kyle uh okay you see job lived in the east of jordan a long long time ago job was a great man he was blessed with ten lovely children a wonderful wife and many friends
he was godly and a good man and fed the poor
he was the most upright and honorable of men and every day he praised god
but one day satan went up to heaven and talked to god
satan talked to god
yes in the book of job satan talks to god and god says to satan "have you seen job he is a great man and he praises me every day"
but satan said "oh yeah he only praises you because you gave him so much if you didnt give him those things he would curse your name"
to which god said "oh yeah ill show you satan ill take those things away from job and he will still praise my name"
and so god had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter jobs oxen and donkeys and murder all his workers
then god sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees
and then as jobs sons and daughters were eating god sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all
job was terribly sad but he fell to his knees and said "the lord giveth and the lord taketh away" and praised gods name
so then job got painful sores all over his body
he was in terrible miserable pain all day every day but he still kept his faith
god said to satan "see i told you job still praises me"
and thats it thats the end
basically
thats the most horrible story ive ever heard why would god do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to satan
oh uhhh i dont know
then i was right job has all his children killed and michael bay gets to keep making movies there isnt a god
and since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance i have to let in two more people a day to cover those expenses need to cover the new ticket guys salary so thats three more admissions a day cleanup crew for the bathroom money to cover paint and upkeep - so thats about four admissions - that brings the grand total to god-damnit eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today
welcome to cartmanland
isnt he getting any better doctor
i dont understand it hes not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all its like he like hes lost all hope well if youll excuse me ive got more tests to run
and now back to money quest on hbc
welcome back to money quest in just over two weeks young financial genius eric cartman has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands
and the way he did it is with the brilliant "you cant come" technique for the first several days the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park it made the public crazy so then weeks later when he opened the doors they were lining up around the block simply amazing
well ahah i think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country
im sorry were no longer taking reservations nobody can eat here youll have to leave now
no im sorry you cant see this movie nobody can see this movie i cant even go in
out nobody is allowed into gracys anymore get out of here
amazing eric cartman is surely the financial genius of our time
