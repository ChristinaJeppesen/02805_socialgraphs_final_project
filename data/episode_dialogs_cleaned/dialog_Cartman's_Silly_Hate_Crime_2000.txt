oh
heh huh uh-oh
and what you need to understand is that this is not appropriate behavior young man mkay
eric dont you realize you couldve seriously injured your little friend
im sorry mom
dont apologize to us apologize to him
im sorry tolkien
well i hope you learned that throwing rocks at people is bad eric
oh i sure do mr mackey i mean i feel really bad uhh what was i thinking the only thing i can do now is try to go on and live day by day see ya later
not this time eric youve got to learn to respect your little friends youre gonna have detention for two weeks
no way
yes way mkay and that settles it now lets all go-
counselor mackey
yes
im agent sharp and this is agent keen were with the fbi
were here to investigate the rock-throwing incident
nn-um mkay uh ive already taken care of it eric cartman here is gonna be punished with two weeks of detention
im afraid its a bit more complicated than that mr school counselor you see since the victim in this case is african-american this is considered a hate crime
what the hell is a hate crime
uh oh but i dont think this is a ruh-
new laws have been passed that make any crime based on race ethnicity or sexual orientation a federal offense
what a federal offense
oh no
oh no
were sorry ms cartman but we must follow protocol your son will be taken into custody and then tried in the federal court of law
oh my goodness
the hate crime trial of the century is underway on court tv tracks u van live heres your host leslie smith
what turns a normal fat little eight-year-old boy into a vicious hate-crime-committing racist we take you live to the courtroom as the defendant takes the stand
mr cartman do you know a boy by the name of "tolkien"
uh yes
who is tolkien
hes a black kid that goes to my school
black did you say black you called him black
he is black
o he said it again he is african-american and so you decided to pick him out
i did
the rage built and built inside your head until it became too much because you hate african-americans
no i hate hippies
what
i hate hippies i mean the way they always talk about "protectin the earth" and then drive around in cars that get poor gas mileage and wear those stupid bracelets - i hate em i wanna kick em in the nuts
oo poopiekins
ladies and gentlemen of the jury this is why we have hate-crime laws this "monster" committed a crimeâ€”not against an individual but against a race do the democratic thing and send his fat little butt to prison
ey dont call me fat asshole
the prosecution rests
dont forget we still have that sledding race this saturday pillow biters
we know
dude this is horrible we gotta get cartman out of court so we can go practice
eric cartman you have been found guilty of committing a hate crime for this i hereby sentence you to the alamosa juvenile hall until you turn twenty-one
no
i am making an example of you to send a message out to people everywhere that if you want to hurt another human being youd better make damn sure theyre the same color as you are court is adjourned
woohoo hooray
bailiffs escort this little bastard to juvenile hall
yes sir
alright you uh-uh-uh whered he go

calm down kenny
(hey)
do you still have that battery-powered toy truck you got last christmas
(yes)
well come on i dont have much time
a car chase is evolving on the 285 corridor east of south park hate-crime suspect eric cartman is trying to outrun federal prosecutors in his friends go-go action bronco our eye in the sky greg nimins is there live greg
tom it looks like the go-go action bronco is heading east on 285 police officers are right behind him but as with any chase theyre keeping a safe distance to avoid any accidents here out on the highway tom it looks like the fugitive is going to make a bold move off an exit off 285 hes going into a residential neighborhood now this is where it could get dangerous as there are pedestrians about
damnit kenny cant this thing go any faster
(why dontcha keep your head down)
tom the police have set a roadblock right where the go-go action bronco is heading this could be the final stand-off
alright thats far enough stop the go-go action bronco and come out with your hands up just bring it to a stop and come on out jeezus hes gonna ram it crazy son of a bitch
well its been over thirteen hours now and still the car chase has not ended
what the hell are they doing
the chase has now moved through most of arizona and nears the mexican border
dude if kenny takes cartman to mexico how are we ever gonna win the sledding race on saturday
dont worry dude that little truck just runs on d batteries its gonna run out of juice soon
were gonna make it kenny were gonna make it to mexico oh god dammit
hello

alright guys it looks like cartmans not gonna be able to sled with us for another 13 years so in the meantime we need someone to race with us against the girls on saturday
yeah cartmans weight was what gave us speed so we need to find the next-fattest kid besides cartman
come on whos the second-fattest kid in south park
uuhh i think clyde is the next-fattest uh-kid

yeah okay get over here clyde
im not fat

governor the free eric cartman now committee is here to see you
naw not another committee send them in this is the free eric cartman now committee
yeah
well boys what can i do for you
okay go ahead and start
i dont start you start
oh uhyeah hello mr governor and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hate-crime laws entitled "hate crime laws a savage hypocrisy" yes over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws
if somebody kills somebody its a crime but if someone kills somebody of a different color its a hate crime
and we think that that is a savage hypocrisy because all crimes are hate crimes if a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife is that not a hate crime
if a person vandalizes a government building is it not because of his hate for the government
and motivation for a crime shouldnt affect the sentencing
mayor it is time to stop splitting people into groups all hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos that we arent the same
but instead we should all be treated the same with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes for in that way cartman can be freed from prison and we will have a chance to win the sledding race on thursday
that is our presentation an idea that we call
"hate crime laws a savage hypocrisy"
hm that made the most sense of any presentation ive heard in the last three years
hurry up theyre sending the dogs after us mph oowww
whats the matter
its my leg i think its broken you go on ahead without me
uhokay
hey youre supposed to say "im not going without you" or something
oh really
look kid you go on youve got something to live out there youve got friends

okay
no youre supposed to say "i cant take these" or something dumbass
oh i cant take these
take them theyll bring you luck now go on get out of here
