o-kay
bye cutie
bye bye darling wow a real-life relationship
all right kids out on the gym floor for pe class
come on stan were gonna play dodgeball
i cant believe it shes in love with somebody else
dude you need to snap out of this so wendy left you for tolkien what are you gonna do just be miserable your whole life
theres nothing else i can do she was my whole life
aw come on dude all youve done for the last four days is mope around you might as well hang out with those goth kids who dress in black and talk about pain all the time
maybe i should at least they will understand me maybe i should hang with the goth kids
life is pain life is only pain were all taught to believe in happy fairytale endings but theres only blackness dark depressing loneliness that eats at your soul
who needs that kind of barbie love anyway everyones just walking around like a bunch of conformists go ahead and wear your business suits so you can make thirty-four thousand dollars a year to buy your condominium theyre all zombies racing to their graves love didnt work for my mom and dad why should it work for me
my dad is such an asshole drunken bastard doesnt even know i exist but then he wont let me go to the skinny puppy concert because my heroine-addict aunt is coming over for dinner dinner thats a laugh just an excuse for my mom to bitch at me for not wearing girly clothes like all the britney spears wannabes at this school
theyre all a bunch of nazi conformists cheerleaders
but if life is only pain then whats the point of living
just to make life more miserable for the conformists
all right so how do i join you
if you wanna be one of the non-conformists all you have to do is dress just like us and listen to the same music we do
k
okay i know its your first day ferrari so i wanna go over the basics with you
okay
first of all theres a five foot rule if you come within five feet of a customer you need to acknowledge them even if theyre not at your table "hey cutie" when youre not serving food or talking with customers you need to dance around and have fun we use things like hula hoops silly strings and water guns to play with the other girls be sure to giggle a lot and be sure to show off your raisins now when you take a customers order you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think youre interested write your name down for them and make them feel special "oh man i am so bored thank god you guys came in" if you want good tips the most important thing is physical contact just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars "ill be right back with your order guys"
wow thank you so much mercedes
okay well i guess were ready to open for business good luck go ahead and open for business porsche
okay
