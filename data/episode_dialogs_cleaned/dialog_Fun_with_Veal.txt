open this door now
kiss my ass
oh jeez he said "ass" to his parents
youre getting in pretty deep dude
i apologize for this mr rancher person

dude thats messed up
you guys check this out
tom im standing in front of the house where four insane boy terrorists have barricaded themselves inside a room with twenty-three live infant cattle
hey look some other kids are doin the same thing we are eugh
several attempts to break into the room have proven unsuccessful tom and the crisis is intensifying heres what some people have to say
we were sleeping when suddenly we heard all the commotion i mean to think this could happen right here in our own community
we gave those kids everything and they turned into little john walkers
the police chief of south park says that there will be no negotiations with terrorists
oh no eh this is big-time trouble now fellas
no this is exactly what we wanted
it is
yeah dont you see this validates everything that were doing if were making the news then this is obviously important to people
tom it looks like i have an update yes it looks like the boy terrorist story is not interesting news to anyone uh nothing else was going on tom so this was the only story we had to make seem important but people are just simply tuning out so hbc will now be switching programming once again to "puppies from around the world"
i dont believe it
ehuh the chinese puppys my favorite so far
butters buh-butters you have your arm around me
oh sorry i thought you were mr pickles
we must help the helpless we must save the unsaved
huh what the hell is that
if we fight together we can make sure the road is pavedfor a brighter tomorrow
hippies
what are they doing here
were with you boys your message is real and your fight is just
hooray hooray
dude those gaywads are on our side
ewww theyre all dirty
what did i tell you stan we save some baby cows from being eaten and now were no-good dirty god-damned hippies
tom the calf terrorist standoff continues as now members of the fbi arrive to put an end to the conflict
oh jesus christ

dude maybe we should end this
no
give me a hard line to the phone in that house
the terrorists already said theres no way theyre coming out
dont worry im a negotiator its my job to talk to freaks like this and bring about a peaceful resolution using clever psychology

what do you have in mind
well how about you send out one of the calves
oh mike youre breakin my balls here mike
just one thats all we want
all right how bout this you guys have all the leverage and we have nothing so how about we give you one calf -
cartman no

well give you one calf if you give us some guns and ammunition of our own
what i i cant do that
oh im sorry i thought we were talkin here but i guess youre not talkin to me goodbye
no no wait oh im sorry im sorry yuh youre right what reason do you have to trust me im just a guy from lakewood trying to make ends meet you know just a blue-collar guy like your dad
dont have a dad mike thats not gonna work
oh all right fine son of a gun let me see what i can do
okay up a little left a little almost there
what is that
were giving the boys some guns in return for a calf

all right well keep ours well send out one calf
well ha- how about you send out two calves
oh jesus you know theres just no talking to you is there mike
o-ogh

im sorry im sorry damnit im losing them okay im sorry just send out one calf
oh nonono now youre gonna have to get us something else
what do you have in mind
a little to the left okay thats good a little to the right
youre giving them a missile
stand down maam stand down this is a delicate process ive almost earned their trust
stans getting worse you guys
mike speak
how are we doin
we got a real sick kid here mike did you get the other things for us
weh ah i did manage to get the fda to officially change the word "veal" to "tortured baby cow"
good good
but i couldnt get you north and south dakota
oh mike breakin my balls mike
now now please can can we get you to come out
all right everythng has worked out the boys have promised to come out and bring the cows out with them
yes all right woohoo
whoops sorry i doubted your abilities mr negotiator
theyre coming out now
yes all we need to do in return is get a cattle-transporting semi-truck that will take the boys and the cattle to denver international airport where we have a fully-gassed airplane waiting to take them all to mexico
what
and they want the guy that plays mr worf on "star trek" to drive the truck in full makeup
jesus christ
all right that does it you are in fact the worst negotiator ive ever seen in action
all right all right ill give you that but in return i want three staples
get out of here well get them the semi and well get them the worf guy if they see that theyll come out and then we could take them
but isnt that dishonest
maybe so but if we dont do something soon there could be fifty even sixty people wholl have to go without veal for dinner are you prepared to let that happen
all right where is mr dorn
i was woken up at three in the morning told i had to put on makeup and come to this town what the hell is going on
im sorry mr dorn its fbi business weve got terrorists making demands and we need your help
this is highly unusual
all right boys we have your truck and we have an airplane on the tarmac at denver international
and worf
my name is michael dorn i play a character called worf
stan it worked
it did
they got us a truck and an airplane and mr worf the calves are gonna be okay
pick me up i i want to see
step back tell those men to step back
do it
mmrrrr
all right woohoo yeah
aw shut up you freakin hippies alright mr worf start the engine and put her in gear oh and you must refer to me as "captain"
where am i supposed to drive to
no see you must say "captain where am i supposed to drive to"
captain where am i supposed to drive to
youre going to back the truck up to the door of the house so we can safely load in the calves
this whole thing is ridiculous
"captain this whole thing is ridiculous"
captain this whole thing is ridiculous
okay all set
tom it looks as though the terrorists are now loading the baby cows into the back of a semi this is still very uninteresting news tom
okay cartman
step on it mr worf
all right
were going
mexico here we come
wait a minute theyre following us full speed mr worf
we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads
"captain we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads"
captain we cannot keep going fast on these icy roads
alright mr worf then reduce speed to forty-five and maintain distance from those police cruisers
stan were almost there youve got to hold on
alright theyre in front of the cattle ranch hit it
oh its a double-cross
alright boys the game is over get out of the truck with your hands up
oh no no
what are you waiting for go kill them worf
im not killing anybody
egh some god-damned klingon you are
were sorry cows we tried we tried
alright boys just stay right there until your parents arrive
can i go now
here you go mr rancher i got your cattle back for you
oh well it doesnt matter now
what do you mean
in the twenty-four hours since the word "veal" was officially changed to "little tortured baby cow" the market has gone dry seems that people see "little tortured baby cow" on their menus they dont feel like orderin
really
yep damn things aint worth spit now ill let em live outside with the other cows and live a normal life
do you hear that stan it worked weve shut down the veal industry stan stan
hes very lucky you got him here when you did he was in a very advanced state of vaginitis
vaginitis
it occurs when a person stops eating meat those sores on his skin were actually small vaginas if we hadnt stopped it in time stan would have eventually just become one great big giant pussy
whoa dude
weve got an iv of pure beef blood pumping into stans veins and the sores are fading
thank god we stopped it in time
well i guess we learned something today its wrong to eat veal because the animals are so horribly mistreated but if you dont eat meat at all you break out in vaginas
hear hear
all right boys its time to go home youve got some serious grounding time to start
ill say
aw were still grounded
but but we we learned things and took up a cause
yes kyle but you still defied your parents and you need to learn that terrorism is never the answer
thats right lets get these terrorists to their rooms but first maybe we can grab some burgers
all right
