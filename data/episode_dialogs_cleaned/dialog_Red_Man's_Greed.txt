well you shouldnt be such a dick dude
whats wrong with gerald
he he lost his house to the native americans
what but dont the native americans know he has nowhere else to go
they dont care
look at them small-minded idiots pouring their life-savings away
their cash flows out of them like diarrhea from the buffalo
yes but we have milked these simple mountain folk almost dry if we really want to see cash flow we need to bring in city-people from denver
yeessss it is time for us to implement our plan a superhighway built from denver right to our casino
and what do we do about the small town of south park that lies in the highways way
simple we buy it and we demolish it ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
and thats really all i can tell you the town of south park is going to be leveled in order to make way for a twelve-lane superhighway
but how can they do that
the native americans have purchased the land out from under us tomorrow theyre buying the last of what they need to have complete ownership
well cant we stop them lets call the bank
the native americans bought the bank
oh my god
now look it isnt all horrible the native americans are offering you retail values on your homes
no screw that well just pool our money together and buy the town ourselves
yeah let the south park people own south park
how much do we have to raise mayor
three hundred thousand dollars
ohhh never mind
how can they do that huh how can they make us all move away
because theyre rich greedy-ass indians
native americans
our whole town gone wed had such great times here
we cant let them do it you guys we have to find a way to stop those native americans
yeah
yeah this is our town
we shouldnt have to make a bunch of new friends somewhere else were a team
yeah
thats right
yeah ahh thats right
yeah were a team
we just gotta figure out a way to raise three hundred thousand dollars
wait a minute ive got it you guys we can get kyle infected with aids and then start a charity organization that we steal money from come on lets go no we cant give kyle aids
we need something thatll get us money tomorrow
hey i know how about a dog parade
dog parade
yeah we dress up all our dogs in little outfits and parade them down the street itll be so adorable
how do we make three hundred thousand dollars doing that
oh uh well we could sell tickets to our moms and dads
our moms and dads are the ones who need money butters
oh
maybe give kyle aids huh lookin a little better now
oh gerald i i cant watch
how can you do this to people
were sorry but if we do not build a superhighway our casino might stop seeing profits
theres more to life than profits
well like what
well like you know slurpees and stuff
well come on honey i guess we should start packing up our things as well
yeah so long south park
mom dad we figured out a way we could raise three hundred thousand dollars
a dog parade
no
stan weve all tried to raise money but we only raise ten thousand dollars and the deadline is tomorrow
i know so how about we take the ten thousand dollars back to the indian casino tell them kyle
the odds on a single number in roulette are thirty-five to one that means with a ten thousand dollar bet you win three hundred and fifty thousand
boys thats ridiculous
look we- weve got nothing to lose
what do you guys think
its a long shot
yeah but its the only shot weve got to save our town
the residents of south park had hoped to raise three hundred thousand dollars but in the end managed to raise only ten the loss of their town may be imminent for the poor people of south park awww i think im going to cwy
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
all right boys youre gonna have to wait here
dad good luck
its in gods hand now stand aside everyone
what are they doing
were gonna try and beat you at your own game chief runs with premise ten thousand dollars on thirty one black
impossible
come on come on
thirty one black
yeah all right woohoo oh we did it we did it oh my god oh this is amazing
no nooo
south park is saved
we have plenty enough to save our town now
yeah but wait three hundred and fifty thousand dollars that means if we won again it will be twelve and a quarter million
we can save the town and be super-rich
oh hell yeah let it ride
let it ride
woohoo yeah
what the hell are they doing
lets go thirty one lets see it
two red you lose
awwwwwww
dammit
hmmm

stan okay you just dont understand the fine points of gambling youre never supposed to stop when youre on a winning streak
a winning streak you played one game
stan okay
what
all right stan okay
you people just got greedy like the native americans
hey mister were not like them all right now we may have pie in the sky dreams once in a while but we arent the ones kicking people out of their homes so dont you compare us to those cold-hearted money-grubbing evil stinky indians im sorry native americans
there you are sir theres the check for your home just sign here and here
well this is it mr slave were officially homeless
jesus jesus christ
dad what are you doing dont take their dirty money
stanley we dont have a choice the native americans own south park now we have to take what theyll give us for our homes
there you go have a nice day
come on you guys this is our town
its over stanley what else can we do
we can stay and fight
yeah when the indians come to tear up our town we kick em in the nuts
(yeah)
yeah they dont own our town we do
im sorry boys you just dont understand economics
itll be okay boys well just move to the next town over
oh sure until the native americans decide they want that land too what if the native americans just keep building their casinos and their highways uh until we have nowhere else to go we have to stand up to them now rrrgh forget it come on you guys
youre all a bunch of god-damned pussies
get out of our way
no we wont let you destroy our town
boys it isnt your town anymore
just because you have a piece of paper saying you own it doesnt make it yours we grew up here our parents grew up here we shop at that wal-mart and eat at that chilis we take fish from the streams and bread them and freeze them to make fish sticks this is not just a town it is our way of life
well your way of life is about to change little boys now move
you cant just roll into places and take peoples lives away
and what are four little boys going to do to stop us huh
we are strongno one can tell us were wrongsearching our hearts for so lohh-oo-ohh-oo-ongall of us knowinglove is a battlefield
this land is not for sale
dammit i thought you said they were dealt with
they were
sorry charlies you can just keep your filthy bastard indian money
filthy bastard native american money
uh oh right huh sorry about that
this isnt over
well never give up you bastards
yeah south park is ours
but what do we do now i mean we cant just stand here and block their way forever
we can stand here as long as it takes
what is the state of our people
last night i spoke with the spirit of the bear and bear said that if we do not build our highway soon our investors may soon sell off their shares of the new casino
yes and eagle says the cumulative shared market loss on the revenue of the new casino drops fifteen percent every day
then we must force the south park people off their petty land
but they are determined and proud and the spirit of the wind has stated that if we use force it could be a publicity nightmare further hurting our net assets
i already have a plan how we can force them off their land sneakily were going to give them blankets
blankets
yes we will present the blankets as a peace offering but what the round-eyes will not know is that the blankets are infected with sars they will all get sars and then sars will run through their town like a buffalo now i need your help getting the sars onto the blankets okay bring them in
lets see how south park deals with this everyone grab a chinese person and rub them on a blanket make sure you rub them all over get the sars nice and deep in there
tom im standing in chilly south park colorado where the residents are entering the third day of their sit-in to try and stop native americans from building a superhighway through their town the temperature is low but spirits are pretty low too
what do they want
were not moving ass-faces
free blanket though i know we have differences we believe that a compromise can be reached in the meantime it hurts us to see you all on television sitting in the cold will you not take this offering as a gesture of good-will
you had me at "free blanket"
free blanket free blanket free blanket
tom it now looks as if the native americans are handing out blankets as a sign of good-will towards the south park people what an incredible display of compassion i certainly hope theres nothing sinister behind it
please as a token of good faith
you understand if im a little wary of trusting you
it is only a blanket mister marsh
well thanks
oh youre welcome
tom its tuesday morning now and the outbreak of sars in south park has reached epic proportions the entire town has been quarantined by the federal government nobody allowed in our out which means nobody can come to our aid it appears this town and this reporter are done for coming up next choosing the right hair conditioner what you dont know about hair care products could be costing you a bundle
its all right dad
hows your mother
shes hanging in there here drink some beer
its cool on my tongue
youre gonna be all right
stanley listen to me i have sars theres only a ninety-eight percent chance that i will live
no dad no
listen stan sars is destroying our people the native americans put it in the blankets they gave us soon there will be only ninety-eight percent of us left
what can i do
you must find a cure for sars son and save our people
cure sars aw jesus
the spirit of middle-class white people is strong in you son seek out the wise man in bellow creek now go go
what
hey my names stan and i was-
your coming was foretold to me youve come to save our people come in watch the cats
uh so do you know how to cure sars
me huh no i am just a guide sit down
you must find the answer yourself by taking an inward journey
an inward journey that sounds kinda gay
let the voices of our ancestors show you the way breathe breathe from the bag of visions
ah oh dude
how much longer must we wait for our superhighway
sars has spread throughout the entire town of south park chief runs with premise their wills will break soon
then i suppose we must be patient
runs with premise come quickly
what is the matter wife
it is our son premise running thin he is very sick
premise running thin what is the matter
he he shared a cup with one of the people from china he has sars
no i told you not to touch them
papa papa
i have given him herbs from the desert plant and water from the cactus of life but nothing seems to be working
this would not have happened if those townspeople would have just moved away no more waiting around tomorrow we begin the final stage of our plan shock and awe
dad dad
stanley did you have an inward journey with the old man did you have a vision
ah i dont know if i did or not i i saw something someone spoke to me and told me the middle-class white way to cure sars campbells chicken noodle soup dayquil and sprite
yes yes of course quickly stan we must give it to everyone
boy that really did the trick stan i thought we were kind of sort of not really done for
thanks to you were all safe now stan
now i will blow your weak sars-infested bodies off the earth what the wait a minute stop stop your your sars where did it go
we have cured ourselves using the medicines of our culture
my son premise running thin has the sars as well you you can cure him
it is amazing all our plants and herbs failed to heal him
but your peoples remedy brings the spirit of the buffalo back into his heart perhaps there are many things we can learn from your way of life
were a simple people all we want is to be allowed to live our lives
you have cured premise running thin in return i shall give you all five dollars credit at the casino all right all right i will not build a superhighway through your town and you can all have your homes back
all right yeah woohoo
well i guess we all learned that south park is more than just a town its a community that nobody can split up
dude who the hell are you
alex alex glick i got to come on and do the guest voice thingy
what get the hell out of here
hi mom hi dad hi jill
