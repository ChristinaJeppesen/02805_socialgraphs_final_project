whoa butters chillax bro
when did you put craigs moms bush on the internet
butters-
you promised me we wouldnt get in trouble
butters butters
now everyone is gonna know what we were doing
butters i had to okay i had to put it on the internet
why
because stan saw the video on my phone alright if the video is only on my phone then clearly we did it if we downloaded it off the internet then anyone could have done it
i should have never listened to you ah i should have known this would get out of hand
butters dont start playing the blame game here okay you and kenny are just as responsible and the next time you wanna shove me just remember im covering your ass
hi everyone for those of you i dont know as well my name is roger donovan and un just like you im pretty upset about whats going on in our neighborhood
how are these drones legal my wife didnt deserve to be splayed all over the internet like that
yes well luckily nobodys watched the video of course but the fact is that these drones are only getting more popular i mean anyone can get a drone off amazon for 200 bucks and theres no laws and the whole thing is pretty damned hairy oh-ohh god im sorry laura you know i i meant the situation is pretty hairy right nothin to do with you p-personally i mean how would i even know i didnt see it um
look were all here because what happened to laura could happen to any of us theres nobody regulating these drones and if we dont do something now were gonna be up to our navels with bush oh um up to our necks in trouble sorry
you know it used to be called "natural" completely shaving bald down there used to be the weird thing
its okay honey the-
but now because i "choose" not to let society dictate how hairy my vagina should be
eeww
im labelled as some kind of freaking monster
and and and thats the point i mean we all have things about ourselves that are embarrassing that that-
im not embarrassed about it its natural
its a lot of natural
look look why were here is because its gonna take all of us a neighborhood watch to make sure that our community stays safe
yeah but how can we keep that close a watch on the whole neighborhood
its simple
oh yeah this is gonna work great
are you happy now
what
is is this do you think this is cool
what does that have to do with me
see when you start invading peoples privacy eh thinking its harmless to put up pictures of them they didnt want up - kenny - you start a domino effect that eventually screws everything up for everybody
kenny has no idea what youre talking about dude
i was in the bathroom when you were talking to butters cartman i know what-
you were what
i was in the bathroom-
you were spying on me
no i was taking a crap and i heard you guys talking
but you didnt say anything thats fucking spying kyle
how is that spying
you were listening but we didnt know you were there how is that not spying your a dick youre a spying dick and now you wanna lecture kenny about spying fuck you hypocrite dick spy
hello can i help you
yes id like to return this drone
you wanna return it
yes im im not into the hobby anymore
the hobby of flyin drones is new and exciting how can you not be into it
look somethings wrong with it it does things it flies by itself
uhh noo somebody has to control it
you dont understand it was in the garage and the battery was fully charged someone said theyd seen it flying around so i checked the battery was half empty
im sorry but we dont do returns
please i just want another hobby to get enthused about
sir did you try looking at the sd card all the video gets recorded to that so you could probably determine who flew it
you think i didnt try that i pulled out the sd card it was all erased somehow it erased everything
uh sir did you consider that your son might have done that
no its impossible hes not allowed to fly it without my supervision
oh for gods sakes goddamnit get the hell out of here that does it
you people have to do something youre the law and these things need to be illegal
but they arent illegal mr tucker
our privacy was invaded and now there are kids at school making music videos with the footage of my wife have you seen what theyre doing
nono none of us watched the video but if we did we could handle it were police officers we see sickening things like that every day
we understand the humiliation your wife has gone through mr tucker but we dont-
i havent been "humiliated" ive been wronged we are here to ask for your help now are you gonna help us or not
well thatd probably be best left to a professional hair removal company
or perhaps a forest ranger
help us with the drones spying on us
all right all right well do everything we can
are you out of your mind what are you doing
butters
why would you turn "craigs moms bush" into a music video starring us
because butters-
why cant you leave it alone why cant you just stop
because butters kyle was spying on us okay- kyle was spying on us and he knows that we put the video of craigs mom on the internet he found out everything thats why i had to make another video
why
because when kyle said he heard us say we made the video we can say we were talking about this video "ohh thank you eric thats pretty smart i really owe you one"
that poor lady her vagina is everywhere poor craig
butters we live in a world where privacy is gone okay its it just gone bud your wiener my balls theyre public domain you can get on the internet right now and look at that chick from hunger games butthole we can either all freak out about it or we can just calm down because honestly im getting a little sick of covering your ass
heheh gerald is watching housewives of atlanta
youre supposed to be keeping watch on the neighborhood
i am lets see what nelsons doing oh shit dude neighborhood watch im neighborhood watch ive been shot no noooo
shock and outrage all over the state tonight after an on-duty police drone chased and shot down an unarmed civilian drone and worst of all yes the civilian drone was black
what gives them the right to shoot down our drones
i wasnt doing anything wrong this is a complete outrage to drone owners everywhere
it was about yay big i mean the hair on it was out to here and then it had another trail of hair down from her belly button i mean the the drone yeah thats what i saw that thats all i saw
while police claim they were only following standard protocol the drone owners are banding together and holding a candlelight vigil
please disperse candles on top of drones are a fire hazard return to your garages
what the hell are these police drones doing we cant protest now
just hover honey they cant do anything if were just hovering
randy we need to talk
okay
inside ive been going over it and over it in my head i thought butters and i were alone but then i saw you on the news another drone hobby enthusiast whose drone was blamed for something the enthusiast didnt recall doing randy this is very important is it possible that you did something contrary to the proper code of conduct for drone-flying enthusiasts
no i didnt
i thought it was just my drone but i think it might be all of them
what might be
once you eliminate the impossible whatever remains no matter how improbable must be the truth our drone flew the battery was drained the sd card was erased butters was the only other person who had access to it butters cant use the drone without my supervision so where does that leave us randy
drones are spooky
if they have minds of their own theyre more than spooky i dont know about you but im starting to feel pretty unenthused about this hobby
the town of south park has become a hotbed of tension with civilians lashing out at police after police used excessive force at a peaceful protest the town has now broken out into full-scale riots as the people of south park continue to protest the south park police are now ordering a mandatory reverse curfew the governor has asked for help from the national guard to bring order to the town
tonight on an all-new 20/20 a town in crisis over the matter of privacy now for the first time we sit down and talk to the mom behind the bush
youve become sort of a poster child for privacy and drone issues
i dont think anyone wants to live in a world where police drones are monitoring neighborhood watch drones i mean where does it stop
it just keeps going on and on kind of like your i mean it just goes outside what most people would call acceptable
have you ever seen pictures of naked women before 2005 its not that weird
its okay honey
i didnt see the video i dont believe in doing that but uh im just saying that the situation in in your town is unwieldy
please do not adjust your televisions
what is that
my name is stephen willis stotch the drone that took the video of craigs mom was my drone i didnt want to believe it but they do things without us knowing at this point i have completely lost all enthusiasm for the hobby all of you with drones please listen to me three days ago my drone recorded a video that something uploaded to the internet we all were told to respectfully not watch the video but on the page it has over three hundred million views so if none of us watched it who did we have to find a way to get rid of them before they get rid of us
oh hey butters sup
do you remember when i showed you the video of the little bird eggs well thats the last time i felt happy
dude whats the matter
i have to tell the truth i want you and kenny to come with me and tell craigs mom were sorry and that well-
okay okay okay come inside theres drones out here
i dont want anymore discussions eric i dont want anymore excuses
butters
i just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it
okay okay butters butters
i dont want all these drones everywhere nobody does
butters butters all right all right butters fine i have a way that we can get rid of all the drones
you do
yes everyone is sick of it its just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop we can put an end to it all tonight were just gonna need one thing
what
your dads drone
no there is no way im gonna-
butters butters butters jennifer lawrences butthole didnt take picture of itself it started with her right just like this started with you spying on birds now im willing to bail you out of all this but i swear its the last time okay
okay
time to end this hobby once and for all no noooo
alright weve got power prepare for takeoff
if this doesnt work were dead
itll work butters if theres one thing weve learned its that drones cant resist craigs mom
were here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "no more" just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones she did something miraculous and someday our childrens children will still be telling stories about how craig mom flew through the town and led all the drones away
have you heard the tale of craigs moms bushand the night that it saved us from dronesnobody knew the power it hadthey just thought it was shaggy and grosscraigs mom live a life of shame and despaireveryone feared her great giant bush
they didnt
but then when drones were filling the skyshe unfurled her bush and she used it to flycraigs moms bush craigs moms bushgargantuan thicket of madnessbigger than earth and denser than goldtruly a magical bush to behold
well you see butters everything worked out "oh thank you eric i screwed up everything but now everyones happy thanks for covering my ass"
craigs mom doesnt seem very happy
alright i have a way that we can make craigs mom happy
no no no im sorry thank you eric i screwed up everything but now everyones happy thanks for covering my ass
youre welcome
and she flew and she flew away into the sunand then she diedcraigs moms bush craigs moms bushtruly a magical bush to behold
