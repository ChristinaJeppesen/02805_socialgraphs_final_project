for four elementary school boys an ordinary day becomes a descent into madness on tonights episode of "i should have never gone ziplining"

its the last day of spring break and all over the small mountain town of south park students are trying to have as much fun as possible for ten year old stan marsh and his friends kyle eric and kenny the last day has come too soon
stan
we could go to the city pool they have a water slide
noo nono im not getting in a pool with kenny he has herpes
(what)
look at his lip youve got herpes dude
(this is not herpes its a cold sore)
no- cold sore is what girls call it kenny its actually herpes
come on guys the day is wasting away what would be something really cool we could do

kyle
all right you guys look ready to zipline
alright
okay just follow me over to the waiting room and well have you take a seat with the others
stan
hi there
hello
hi
the boys have just made a sobering discovery for ten year old stan marsh the realization that he will be with a tour group has caused his adrenal glands to slow down the average human acts a certain way when surrounded by friends and family but in a tour group the brain has to work overtime acting nice and pretending to care about people on the tour
hey how are you
good how are you
kyle
alright our last zipliners are here
sorry we made you wait everybody
inside kyles mouth the muscles contract to force a smile even though in his brain kyle is thinking "dude fuck you"
we dont mind
cartman
welcome to backcountry adventures well hey there michael
hey there michael
stan
oh and dont forget to take in the nar back to you michael
thanks michael anybody have any questions
no
i have a question can we review the best ways to hold a rope again
stan
lets get out there and get zippin
jesus christ
finally
the boys think their ordeal is over but what they dont realize is that things are about to go from bad to worse
here we go guys zipliniiin
everyone just step on in the shuttle
shuttle
how how long do we have to take the shuttle
its about forty-five minutes
its a devastating blow for kyle its almost too much to bear his brain is already lacking excitement and now just the word "shuttle" makes kyles brain fire neurons that bring up memories of just how lame shuttles can be
well come on we dont have a choice
alright guys should be about forty five minutes to the freshest nar nar why dont we go around the van and get to know each other a little bit
uh thats okay
well my names pete nichols and this is my wife donna and uh make a long story short we came out here to see our relatives who live down in moab they uhhh been livin there about twenty years now and uh long story short they told us that as long as we were in the rockies we should try ziplining so long story short we looked around in the newspapers and on the internet and on billboooards and you know make a long story short we found this company and thought wed give er a try so then we called and we made a reservation and thats when you know long story short we just thought-
its almost three oclock and the boys are still on the shuttle
were gettin close are you guys gettin psyched
wooo
but what the boys dont realize is that a massie storm is brewing last night eric cartman had kung pao spaghetti from california pizza kitchen inside erics stomach the kung pao has just met with the del taco he ate for breakfast it has already started to tear down the layers of barbeque bk toppers that have been building up for months and now to compensate for all the annoying tourists eric is ingesting massive amounts of mountain dew the caffeine and sugar turn the soupy fast-food liquid in his stomach into a toxic gas when the gas is released it carries with it tiny particles of erics fecal matter fecal matter which floats up and into kyles nasal passage
dude did you fart
mmmm no
alright buys were here
thank god
alright here we are looks like we got some good nar to zipline through today uh but before we climb up and start ziplining does anyone care to know about these trees biology
the trees biology
we are running a little late but if anyone really wants to know we could take a few minutes
i think were good
id like to know about the biology of the trees
okay well this is a ponderosa pine it covers a more extensive area than other ameri-
stan
alright remember to keep your clear of the cable and just let your equipment do the work now when youre about halfway down the zipline the cameras gonna take your picture so when i call out "shockabra" look up and give the camera a nice "shockabra" alright you ready

cartman

guys guys does it really matter whose idea it was
yes
alright look we can make it you guys we cant panic if the four of us dont zipline the tour will move faster we are gonna make it out of here okay
but what the boys dont realize is that erics body is already shutting down from stage 4 diarrhea inside his stomach bile has just dislodged an arbys ultimate angus in the average human this would only cause mild diarrhea but eric cartman is now drinking double dew a mountain dew product with twice the sugar and caffeine of regular mountain dew his rancid feces is now rapidly converting to a thick paste the diarrhea shoots out of erics anus and into his underwear eric cartman is a ticking time bomb
dude did you just shit your pants

we got some lunch set up for ya up ahead some turkey sandwiches and diet double dew
aaaaaaaaaah
uh oh
so anyway long story short i was born in 1953 at six in the morning
an attempt to make a bad day better becomes a descent into madness on "i should have never thought horseback riding would be any better than ziplining"
this here waterfall is called heartbreak falls would you all like to know why its called heartbreak falls
well i certainly would
kyle kyle kyle come on wake up
just go go without me

i cant take it anymore why do people say "long story short" theyre not making it short stan
stan
you guys you guys get up listen to me theres a lake a hundred yards down that way theyve got a marina with boats just sitting there
a marina
we can take a boat you guys we can probably take it all the way back to fairplay
whats the point
come on you guys a boat all to ourselves itll be fun what could possibly go wrong
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell trapped on a 42-foot powerboat which is only allowed to go five miles an hour
because we keep getting screwed over by your diarrhea
well its not my diarrheas fault that you took us all ziplining you fuckin jew
ziplining was your idea you fatass
the fourth graders are in a nightmare they cannot escape
kenny whose idea was it to go ziplining mine or kyles
i dont know i really dont give a shit
for four elementary school boys an alrady tragic day becomes a descent into madness on "i should have never got on a goddamn boat"
oh no youre not stinking up the entire boat youre taking a crap off the side into the water
beavers
after cleaning cartmans diarrhea and fighting off beavers the boys have made a terrifying discovery that boating is just as boring as ziplining
stan
waaaaaaaaaaaaah
if the boys fall asleep now from the lack of excitement they could die
here everyone drink some mountain dew
kyle
im not sharing with kenny he has herpes
hey fuck you cartman
four young boys in colorado are on a trip from hell and just when it seems it cant get any worse
kenny kenny
kenny mccormick has died of boredom
oh my god they killed kenny you bastards
no not they you look what your ziplining idea has done you killed kenny youre the bastard
it wasnt my idea it was yours you killed kenny you bastard
stan
stop it it was me my idea
you
four days ago i came across a brochure for ziplining i thought it would be fun i only acted like it was an idea we all came up with together
so you intended for us to go ziplining all along why stan
if you signed up three friends you got a free ipod nano
you sold us out for an ipod nano
i had no idea ziplining would be so boring
you you killed kenny
you bastard you bastard stan
kyle
stan
but then miraculously the boys prayers are finally answered
cartman
you came for us
mr hankey
thank you mr hankey
howdy ho boys lets get you back home
cartman
after nearly four hours in the colorado wilderness the boys are finally going home from the boat the boys were airlifted aboard mr hankeys magical helicrapter in the four hours since they had left home the boys had traveled so far that mr hankey then had to fly them on his seven turdy seven from there it was only an hour ride back home on the poochoo express four friends turn apart by tragedy would now start the long journey back to forgiveness kenny mccormicks remains were finally brought home to his parents and the boys received treatment for their herpes
cartman
kyle broflovski spent twenty seven days in the hospital having fecal matter removed from his nasal passages stan marsh dedicated himself to raising awareness about the boredom risks of ziplining his awareness videos became so popular that stan once again ended up jacking it in san diego as for eric cartman he refused to let the tragedy stop him from doing what he loves most in just two weeks he was back to drinking diet double dew defiant to dew the math
