artonius jackson catches the ball hes running down the sideline- oh
bohhhhh did you see that hit boooom
jackson stops at the 45 and he is slow to get up
that was a great hit boys remember that at practice tomorrow
yeah jackson took a real shot and well im not sure what hes doing now but uh it appears as if hes looking for his keys dan
yeah and that doesnt make a lot of sense because ever since his concussion in 06 he doesnt even have a license
coach martin is coming over to tell him that now but jackson appears to think hes in a car driving home
well during this time out were happy to be joined by the commissioner of the nfl roger goodell commissioner a lot of hoopla about concussions this year in the nfl hows the league handling all that
well there certainly are interesting statistics coming out dan and we are deeply concerned anduh and waiting to see if theres really any direct correlation between football and head trauma
oh and it looks like some of the mfl alumni are takin the field now theres all-pro safety martin gregors and fullback jim harris looks like his pants are down around his ankles
somebody should let him know oh and old surehand mike tafthill who seems to be baking an imaginary cake dan
yeah not sure if thats meant to be a cake or or perhaps a a loaf of bread but he definitely thinks hes baking something
boy i just dont get football guess thats why i suck at it
you dont suck at football butters you suck at all sports
thats true old eric tells me i should work at a thai massage parlor im so good at sucking
thats right butters
and with that the browns are ready to kick it off back to the broncos
all right all right here we go boys watch them on the kickoff all right special teams are the most important plays
we dont have kickoffs anymore
huh
the school said theyre the most dangerous plays so they dont have us do em anymore
wait wait wait wait whoa what the fuck
okay before we get started with this pta meeting does anyone have any outstanding issues
yeah id like to talk about this genius new rule in the football program about no kickoffs
uh yes weve decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions mkay
oh yeah we dont want our kids getting hurt playing football but i think i have a way to make it even better why dont we have the players just wear bras
bras
yeah the players should all wear bras and instead of helmets they should wear little tinfoil hats cause you know its the future and we shouldnt be so barbaric
how would the bras and tinfoil hats make it safer
oh youre all not getting it see while were at it well have a balloon instead of a ball and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug
huh you you think the students would like that
oh theyd love it a sport where safety is all that matters how about we call it "sarcastaball"
mmkay would would you mind being the coach of the south park sarcastaball team
jesus christ yes i would love to be the coach of the sarcastaball team
dad do we really have to wear bras
yes stan this is what people want dont worry you look really cool
i got the balloon coach marsh err what should i do with it
oh you know try to get it into the end zone but be really polite about it
okay hey hey heh excuse me pardon me heh you guys look terrific wow this game is great
hows it going coach
hows it going awesome nobodys getting hurt and the kids are learning valuable life lessons cause hugging and safety are what the world is all about
so youre happy with these changes
happy im thrilled look at how much better this is
okay
is football safe for your kids concerned parent randy marsh says "no" and has started a movement to reform the sport gathering followers by the hundreds
oh this is good nice for you all to turn out in record numbers to show your support for sarcastaball yeah yeah were were through with our kids getting knocked on the ground and tackled lets make sarcastaball the official school sport nationwide go on pat yourselves on the back
showing just how much one concerned parent can do marsh then found himself in front of the leaders of washington
yeah yeah lets do that we got the economy in the toilet a big election coming up but this countrys number one priority should be making football safer
this is ridiculous are we really going to go out there and play north park like this
i cant even remember if were supposed to hug the fullback or compliment him im so confused
this game is stupid i have no idea how to go out on the field and be as nice as i can to the other team
yeah you know what screw this
hey whoa well i cant believe what im hearing weve been practicing and gettin ready for this game and you fellas just wanna quit
we dont even understand how this game is played
this great game isnt about plays its about sportsmanship and compassion and when i look around this locker room well i see some of the nicest most compassionate guys ive ever met well tolkien youre nicer than anybody i know and clyde well you give better hugs than anyone out on that field
thats true
are we just gonna let north park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us bein nice is about whats inside you when your enemy is nice to you you just be nice right back and if they give you two balloons well you give them three
yeah
and when they try an-and thank you for those balloons you say "ah i dont need any thanks i did it cause it was the right thing to do" and then you give them a smile
yeah
and when that other team tries to cover you well thats when you gotta reach deep down right down to your creamy center well that place well that place inside of you where where all the gooey happy-lovin goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest most compassionate player youve ever been and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy
yeah yeah
lets do this stan hook up my bra
as commissioner of the nfl i am so thrilled to see our nations youth embrace sarcastaball over traditional football oh but why stop there since football is so barbaric we should change too so lets give a biiig welcome to the new coach of the denver broncos randy marsh congratulations marsh good job

holy shit i think i do
welcome back to rome were gonna talk some sarcastaball i cant wait i cant wait to talk sarcastaball because its really compelling joining me now is the coach of the denver broncos and the inventor of sarcastaball randy marsh thanks for calling in randy really happy to have you on the show
yeah its awesome to be on your show
randy first off thanks for taking the sports that we all love and turning it into a sarcastic nightmare way to go
thanks jim cause its totally what i intended you know when i came up with the idea i was sure it was gonna end up like this
well it certainly makes for an exciting game how about last nights nail-biter that ended zero to zero thats a game i wanna watch twice thats a game i wanna watch four times check that ill watch that game five times good luck on sunday im sure thatll be another game that i could watch twelve times check that thirteen times
thanks jim
randy arent you gonna come join your family for dinner
oh yeah ive totally got time to do that sharon in fact how about i go downstairs and make a four-course meal for all of you check that a seven-course meal
randy somethings happened are you un-able to stop being sarcastic
oh right i cant stop being sarcastic now
im telling you randy i think this sport is doing something to your brain
right its doing something to my brain and now i cant stop being sarcastic
do you mean that
yes i totally mean it help me sharon help me
all right first string cover those wideouts tell em how much you like their outfits clyde tolkien hug those two players and give their quarterback a kiss
awwwwww
cartman you idiot
stay positive stan all right guys cuddle up cuddle up now what is goin on out there
that kid is provoking us hes saying mean things to try and piss us off
yeah we need more of your mojo butters
oh all right well all right here you go
uh hum mmm im sorry mr marsh but there appears to be permanent damage
oh boy this is great my week just keeps getting better
how do we fix this doctor
you dont im sorry there just isnt enough research in how sarcasm affects the brain
so thats it i should just go home and forget about what this sport has done to me let thousands of people play sarcastaball and get hurt too
oh really you you think theres a correlation between sarcasm and sarcastaball really thats fascinating please go on
no sarcastaball has nothing to do with it i just i just really enjoy being sarcastic and so i must be finding an excuse
you know i have a 50-year-old alzheimers patient out in the waiting room who cant even remember his family but lets forget about him and focus on how sarcastaball might be damaging peoples brains
my son is out there playing that game its heartwarming to see you have such high regard for his safety
okay well ive got a better idea lets get all the funding for cancer research and genetic diseases lets lets take all that money and make commercials that say "hey america sarcasm might not be such a great thing for your brain"
thank you doctor thank you so much
jim rome here hey i love sarcastaball just as much as the next guy but sometimes its so thrilling i need an extra burst of energy to get me through a game thats when i reach for a bottle of this butters creamy goo
you play hard you need a sports drink that gives you that extra boost sports these days are all about being nice so take your game to the next level with butters creamy goo youll be filled with feelings of good tidings and be nicer than a ray of sunshine
like me
get with it and get the goo
butters creamy goo is chock full of all the essentials an athlete needs commitment compassion and comradery and now its available in quart size
when i get hot and tired only one thing can boost my compassion now im back in the game
go and chug a bottle of butters creamy goo
best served just above room temperature
42 red 13 sunshine and happy thoughts sunshine and happy thoouughts hut oh no that kids gonna intercept it good job kid
stan stan
dad
get in the car stan were going home
what
were sorry stanley we dont want you playing this sport anymore
hey get off the field mkay
everyone everyone listen theres something you all need to know about sarcastaball it turns out its totally safe yeah its super safe its like so safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh oh sorry sorry hang on gotta not be so sarcastic ahem let me try that again listen everyone if you let your kids play sarcastaball youre a fucking genius ogh gyugh cut sorry let me try this again look what im trying to say is we should have like 10 sarcastaball leagues because then everyone- would- god damn it
stanley just get your things and come on were going home
whoa whoa you cant you cant tell me what to do
yeah were your parents we cant tell you what to do
dont you see what this sport has done to your father do you want to end up like him
oh right like he doesnt exaggerate every disease he gets
ohohh randy its happening
mr marsh listen i know you care about your son but hes a heck of a player hes good at tickling laughing and getting along
look the point has been made okay im warning you being this sarcastic is dangerous
were not being sarcastic dad is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence is it so hard for you to believe that when butters says "competitiveness can be compassionate" hes being completely sincere
i dont see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity
thats because youre too grumpy and negative to believe it what you need is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness
yeah dad you need some of this
this is cum
and you can just sit here in your room and think about what youve done just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesnt mean you need to take it to "oh why dont we just drink each others cum" sarcasm like that is homophobic chauvinistic and completely lacking in maturity any questions
whats sarcasm and whats cum
well talk about that when youre older
come on everybody lets work on that kick off change and get back to some football
welcome back to rome some of you might have seen me on tv last night turns out the drink i endorsed was semen turns out a little kid was just bein sarcastic that kids probably grounded for a month check that im sure hes grounded for two months and a week football needs to be made safer so why dont we have players in bras drinking semen yeah thats a fastball right there thats a real stroke of philosophic genius more little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football and i dont know what else to say but "so long sarcastaball it was nice knowin you" lets just hope nothin like this ever happens again probably wont not for another year check that couple of days
dad hey dad
what
my wiener is all stiff and pointy
oh well butters thats just the friendly compass see whenever you have friends in the area your little compass there tells you where they are its pointing up because jesus is your friend
thanks dad
