you live on the moon
i used to i wish i could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again
oh my god
why dont you just tell the people here at the sea park
i cant tell them because theyre evil communists from the horsehead nebula they want to kill all us zypods so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform
thats terrible
dude dude the boss is coming
uh uh sorry boys i cant talk anymore im too sick cant talk any more
alright guys listen up this may sound a little strange but the whale at the denver sea park is going to die unless we get it to the moon
well okay lets do it
the whales name is willzy-x and he told us hes dying on our planet weve come up wth a plan but were gonna need all of your help to make it work
a whale talked to you
its true the whale talked to all of us in between shows at his orca tank
hey that whale talked to me too after everyone left the show i walked up to the glass and he started talking
weh-well why didnt you tell anybody
well i thought i was crazy he said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up
well youre not crazy the whale talked to all of us and he needs our help getting him home
so its true
nobody else is going to help him you guys weve got a chance to do something pretty special here are you with us
what do we do
stan
all right in order to make our plan work were going to need the pool from clydes back yard timmys wheelchair the russian government and all of our skateboards
timmihhhhh
craig token get the slings ready
shhh willzy-x dont say anything were gonna bust you out of here
dude did you see that episode of trading spouses last night that was insane yeah well ha- whoa what the hell
how could you not have seen anything its a whale for christs sake
it must have been taken while i was going to the bathroom
were you in there for three hours
dont yell at me
what happened
somebody kidnapped jambu took him right out of the park
what how
i dont know
all right people its obvious were dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group those bastards have done stuff like this before
sir sir weve found a note
a note let me see that were taking willzy-x home to the moon long live the zypods what the hell does that mean
harris run a fingerprint on that note nelson find out what kind of crayon it was written with well find out who was responsible for this
we have to tell them we know what those boys look like
we cant tell them then theyre theyre gonna think this is all our fault
it is all our fault
how were we supposed to know that they were gonna actually do it
i shouldnt have laughed all those times weve messed with those kids heads i shouldnt have just sat there and laughed
dont you say that it was funny it was really funny weve just weve just gotta make this right ourselves
how
weve gotta track down those kids before the police do
comrades im afraid our situation is dire the economy is stale and i very soon mother russia will no longer be a country
sir sir somebody is on telephone another rich american wants to fly into space
hello hello this is russian president
hi my names kyle uh i understand that your country flies people into space for money
yes we certainly do what were you looking for
i need to book one trip to the moon please right away
the moon that is quite large trip but im sure we can do it
you can awesome
it sounds like were in business we will just need say twenty million dollars
twenty million are you nuts we dont have that kind of money
what
but you need to understand we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon
goddamnit it is prank call again kiss my ass george bush this is not funny
what happened
they want twenty million dollars
twenty million just to go to the dumb moon
that was it that was you guys whole plan ask the russians to take the whale to space
they were going to do it for that n sync guy
oh jesus now what are we gonna do
all right look theres gotta be other third-world countries with space programs weve gotta split up and find someplace cheaper thats all
well we cant keep the whale out here anymore people are gonna see it
a beloved performing orca whale has been stolen from the denver sea park a full investigation is underway but tracking down the kidnappers is proving to be one whale of a problem
thanks tom im here at the denver sea park where believe it or not dozens of people have come to show support for whoever took the whale
thats right we are members of the animal liberation front whales do not belong in tanks they belong in the ocean we applaud whoever did this noble deed set the whales free
set the whales free
one thing for certain something is certainly fishy here at the sea park tom
thank mitch it seems that this problem is almost un-bear-able lets hope that whale is found
this is so bad man how do we even know this is the right town to look in
will you relax those kids said they were from south park weve just gotta go door to door do you have the composite sketch we did
