mayor its about the south park flag
oh jesus christ not this again
we cannot change the south park flag mayor
mayor as ive said before i find that flag to be racist and insensitive
chef i respect you very much but you have to understand that this has been the south park flag since some of our ancestors like my great-grandfather founded this land
that flag represents a time when blacks were persecuted by whites how can a black man not be bothered by it
ahalright chef ill have my assistants hold up the flag and you tell me what exactly you find racist about it
you dont see anything wrong with that flag
chef what about the baseball team the cleveland indians huh should they change their name because its racist
yeah
no because its their history
look i have gone to every quiet protest i could i have written everyone ive put up signs but now im telling you this flag will be changed
and im telling you it wont
oh boy
okay children in mr garrisons absence i would like to turn the classs attention to current issues some people think the south park flag should be changed while others believe that changing the flag is wrong i think this is a perfect subject for your debate club
aaaaah
i see that youve already had a lot of interesting debates this year pro-choice vs cartman pro-gun control vs cartman a-and people against the clubbing of baby seals vs cartman and apparently the winner of all your debates so far has been cartman
thaaats ri-ight
cartman doesnt always win he just gets pissed off and goes home so we cant debate anymore
yeah
nah-ah im just a better debater than you guys
you dont even know what youre debating about half the time
yes i do
no you dont
oh yeah well screw you guys im going home
told ya
alright children well unlike mr garrison i want you all to go out and research this debate before we pick teams tomorrow youll need to choose which side of this poignant debate you are on
this is about history kids if you dont have respect for your past then you can never expect to- bird -then you can never expect to have a future nowadays everyone wants to change mascots and flags because theyre not "politically correct" well where does it end i mean people are gonna start sayin that the denver broncos are offensive to horses and then well have to- a squirrel and then well have to change everything and pretty soon all our history will be forgotten but to really understand the south parks flags importance you need to know about south parks history ned heres a big history buff and he can tell you the whole story ned

i mean germany was united under the swastika right but… obviously history wasnt as important as changing the views after the war and stuff so hey changed it
hey thats a pretty good point cartman

good evening brothers our first order of business tonight is to have brother anderson update us on last weeks minutes
last week we decided we hate blacks and jews a lot
alright and now its time for us all to come together and… do our cake raffle
oh cake raffle
this weeks winner is… uh 2 9 7 4
i won i won i won the cake
god job brother
cartman
ahh
say itll be like this forever
okay it will be like this forever
oh cartman
aaaaaaaaaah brrrrr whats wrong with me ahhh its okay get a grip girl
wendih wendih
aaaah
wendih look at me
oh god please dont let this be happening
alright brothers listen up as you know this fine city is holding a vote on whether or not to change their flag but lynching minorities is history so what are we gonna do about it
lets say that if they change the flag well burn down the capitol
yeah
lets say that if they change the flag well never leave this town
yeah
lets say they should change the flag
yeah wah
uh whats that brother
i think we should switch sides
me too nnn-thats a good idea
look we have to accept the fact that most people in the world hate us right
yeah m-hm
so whatever side were on is the side thats gonna lose right
right yeah
so why dont we all say that we want the flag changed that way most folksll vote to keep it the way it is
thats a great idea brother
yeah
alright it is decided we will officially tell everyone that we want the flag changed so that they will all vote against us
hooray yeah
were smart
that worked perfectly ned
well alright now that thats out of the way it is time to play "whose got the silliest thing on under their robe"
yeah woohoo
jesus ned these guys are completely nuts
mm-yup
that is the most insane thing ive ever seen i cant believe those people are on our side i mean is our side that crazy oh hello chef big debate tomorrow i guess oh jesus the robes chef this isnt what it looks like youve gotta listen to us
i aint gonna listen to nothin this whole cracker-ass town can kiss my ass
ned im starting to think that maybe history aint worth defendin sometimes
thanks for coming over bebe i have something to tell you
sure what
bebe im attracted to cartman
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i know
why would you tell me this why would you tell anyone this
because i dont know what to do i cant concentrate and if i cant concentrate then i cant win the debate tomorrow the whole vote is dependent on me doing a good job-
alright look when two people work closely for a long time sometimes they feel whats called "sexual tension" sometimes you just have to act on impulse and get it over with
you mean i should kiss him
kiss him and get it out of your system
oh god
well i certainly would like to thank all the parents for their support of our debate club i r-realize that many of you are torn by the issues as well so perhaps the children can shed some light on us well start with wendy testaburger on the "flag should be changed" team
the- the- uh aheh ahum the… the- uh ahhhhh the first argument we- ah… let me start over the uh- oh god could you all excuse me for a moment mmmmmummmmeeemmeeemeeemmee
oh
oh god
there now the main point we would like to make is oftentimes it is prudent to change history as times change we hope to grow and as we grow our rules must change it is a natural part of evolution thank you
okay and kyle and stans team your main point
our main point is that the flag shouldnt offend anyone because killing has been around since the beginning of time all animals kill and the animals that dont kill are stupid ones like cows and turtles and stuff so people should not be so upset about killing
whoa whoa whooaa you just missed the point entirely
huh
im not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin killed its because its racist
racist
children dont you even know what this argument is about that flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people
ooooooohhh
ooooooohhh
w-we really didnt see it that way
but thats a black man up there
y-yeah but… the color of someones skin doesnt matter
well of course it matters when- …oh my god wait a minute you children didnt even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people did you
no
why that is- that is the most beautiful thing i have ever heard
what
what
dont you see all this time i thought these little crackers had turned racist when actually they were so not racist that they didnt even make a separation of black and white to begin with all they saw when they looked at that flag was five people
awww
awww
yeah
im sorry children i was wrong about you but i still the flag needs to be changed but now i realize that i almost let racism turn me into a racist
yeah you know uh i suddenly found myself on the side of klan members ive never had anything against blacks chef
oh i know you dont jimbo ive known you for almost ten years youre a good man
weve been way too divisive over this chef maybe we can come up with a- compromise flag—something that everybody can be happy with
i think thats a much better start than me tryin to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers
ooh huhuh oooh
oh sweet dude i dont think we have to do this stupid debate now stan
this has been an interesting week in south park weve all done a lot of growing this week everyone was afraid to take a stand on this issue but now we have learned once again that black white yellow brown or whatever we are all just people and so i am very excited to unveil our new south park flag
wait i dont get it
no see theres people of all colors and they added a black guy as one of the hangers too so its not racist
hooray
i have to admit it that is a lot nicer
phew im sure glad thats over with
me too
i cant believe how right bebe was about feeling under pressure with somebody as soon as it was over all my feelings for you just vanished
oh huh yeah yeah totally huh
im totally back to normal see you later
yeah see you later heh ho huhuh he haha
hahaha stan stan wait up
