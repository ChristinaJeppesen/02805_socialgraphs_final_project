children children we have a very special announcement your classmate tolkien has just returned from winning the colorado child star contest with his incredible singing well lets give him a hand
token sings
of course he sings hes black
tolkien is going to sing in front of a huge audience at the miss colorado pageant in denver and for doing it hes gonna be paid two hundred dollars
whoa
two hundred dollars
now of course as a woman im a bit against those chauvinistic pageants but i hope that you children take a moment today to congratulate tolkien for being so special
wow two hundred dollars can you imagine
how come we never get opportunities like that
you wanna know what it is guys
were not talented
thats right were not talented see were not the artistic side were the thinking side
yeah were too smart to be talented
wait you guys i just had an amazing idea tolkien is going right to the top right i mean hes gonna be a huge star
probably
so why shouldnt we get some of that money we can be tolkiens agents that way we get ten percent of whatever he makes
hey yeah we deserve that money just as much as he does
we just need a really kickass office and some nice suits a and a fountain in our lobby all top agencies have fountains in their lobbies we gotta make tolkien think he needs us when actually he doesnt need us at all
hes looking at the sign
perfect all right you guys get back to the office ill bring tolkien there
all right
wait a minute you guys this is very important when i bring tolkien back to the office have kenny hide in another room and call the phone on my desk
why
because ill answer and pretend im talking to somebody super famous and important when tolkien sees that maybe hell think were legit
its genius
okay go go here he comes yeah well then tell him were just not interested oh hey tolkien buddy my man what is up
nothin
hey you know i heard you were doing something down in denver tomorrow night
yeah
yeah i dont know if i ever told you this before but im actually an agent over at the super awesome talent agency you may have seen our ads around town anyway why dont you come down to the office tolkien maybe i can convince the company to represent you
im supposed to be home by 330
this will only take a second
welcome to our offices tolkien as you can see we are quite a successful company did you notice the fountain pretty nice hm come on over this way tolkien guys you remember tolkien hes thinking about becoming a client
ohhhh token right yeah youre makin a smart move man
now tolkien i i know what youre saying to yourself youre saying "hey why do i need an agency why should i give them ten percent" right
yeah
tolkien the truth is that without representation youre in danger of being taken advantage of uh uh excuse me just a second tolkien super awesome talent agency oh yes hello how are you abraham lincoln yeah yeah no im happy you called abraham lincoln im just sort of in the middle of something right now
can i talk to you
ill ill call you back abe

tolkien actually pays attention in school unlike you fatass
jew
you guys were gonna lose our client

guys guys guys dont you see what were doing jesus were not talking about an object here were were talking about a person i mean look at what weve all become all this violence and anger and and for what for control over somebodys life who w-were all just trying to leech off of
yeah
wing doesnt belong to us or to you were all just caught up in a business that treats people like commodities
perhaps youre right we spend all this time mooching off the hopes and dreams of others forgetting that they are human beings
yeah its not a very satisfying feeling
i am tired of this business it is a very dirty and perverse business
its a lousy business i quit
me too
aw aw guys come on
we quit too its time for us to find another way to make money from now on all contracts we have on people are null and void
all right
mr stallone thanks all of you for coming to his sons wedding and now as a special treat it is his pleasure to give you the music of wing
sing sing a song make it simple to last your whole life long
boys thank you so much for eveything you rearry helped us out
