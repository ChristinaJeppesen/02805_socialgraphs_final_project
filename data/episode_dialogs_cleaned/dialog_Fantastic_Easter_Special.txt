in my easter bonnet with all the frills upon it ill be the grandest lady in the easter parade
look at that one huh half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker im good
uh can i ask a question why do we do this
wha what do you mean "why do we do this" its easter
right so why do we color eggs
wulll ssso that the easter bunny can hide them
yeah but why
stanley easter celebrates the day that jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins
so we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them
thats right
you dont see the missteps in logic with that look im just saying that somewhere between jesus dying on the cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a a gap of information
stanley just dye your goddamned eggs
i dont feel like coloring eggs i dont get it
what is wrong with him
well hes just getting older randy maybe hes figured out the easter bunny isnt real
you know so little
and i want a baltor soldier doll for easter and five crashngo rc cars you got that do you have that
ahh dont you think thats-
nono you dont ask me questions you are a rabbit i am a human so if you dont bring me what i want for easter i can fucking kill you
smile
bye easter bunny
oh my god
all right can you explain to me whats going on
huh
what is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that what does that have to do with jesus dying on the cross it is symbolic are you trying to reference something that happened in biblical times answer me
look kid ahh im j- im just a guy in a costume
i know that but i figure you must have some knowledge of what easters about if youre playing the easter bunny at the mall
huhuh easters just easter just just go with it kid
no im not gonna just go with it im gonna find out whats behind all this
i need a break can i have a break we have a problem somebodys onto us yeah hes askin a lot of questions only a matter of time before he finds out what easters really about yes i understand what must be done call the others
mom dad anybody home
not now stanley im on the toilet
dad youve gotta help me
hang on im taking a crap
dad theres easter bunnies chasing me
what
they chased me from the mall i dont know what they want theyre coming in dad open the door dad
we need to talk stan ih its okay guys
randy
yeah cause it turns out the kid were after is my son
ohhh
tell the grand hare everything is okay ill take it from here
i wanted to keep this from you stan i really wanted to wait until you were older but you just had to keep asking questions
why were those other rabbit guys chasing me
we have to be careful when we think somebodys onto us we are all part of a secret society stan a very ancient very important society of men who follow the way of the rabbit and protect the secret of the easter bunny we are called the hare club for men
does mom know about this
duh its the hare club for men chicks wouldnt understand
i dont understand
i belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years our identities have to be protected
could could you take off the ears please
stan you dont seem to understand how serious this is the secret of easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world
so what is the secret of easter
i cant tell you you have to be allowed into the society first but but perhaps its time
i always knew this day would come when my son would be brought into the society reminds me of the day i was brought in by my father
grandpas in it too
of course marshes have been in the hare club for men for generations all the way back to the beginning
dad do i have to wear this bag over my head the entire time
you arent a member yet you cant know where our secret meetings take place were going to a distant location an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away

sanctum piter oteum deus ore uneumhippitus hoppitus reus hominein suspiratoreum lepus in re sanctumhippitus hoppitus reus domine
all hail the cute rabbit snowball
hail snowball
stan marsh are you ready to hear the secret of easter
yeah
are you sure son once you hear the secret you will be bound to the hare club for men forever
yeah i wanna know already
very well at the last supper jesus christ met with his 12 disciples it was there that-
they found us
protect snowball
theyre everywhere
come on weve gotta go stan take snowball and get out of here
where am i supposed to go
just get out of here
where is the rabbit
where are you taking us
no im not goin anywhere
jesus christ
who did you give the rabbit to search the area the boy could not have gotten far
oh no
help
what happened
my dads in a rabbit-worshiping cult called the hare club for men they protect the secret of easter but before they said what it was they were attacked by ninjas and put me in charge of snowball
im kind of finger painting right now
dude they took my dad away they even shot one of his fellow hares and now theyre after me do you know anything about easter what is the connection between jesus and rabbits and colored eggs
dude im jewish i have no idea
nelson nelson nelson say something
my legs i i think theyre broken
nelson do you know where we are where did they take us
dont know we traveled for hours kept blacking out
you
hi wed like to speak to a professor teabag
what is it in regard to
the history of easter
sorry boys its a little late for me to be giving lectures
please do you know anything about the hare club for men
the keepers the guardians of the secret
my dad is in it this rabbit is too somehow
come on in
the hare club for men has been around for centuries one of its most famous members was leonardo da vinci behold the last supper the dinner christ had with his disciples the night before he was crucified what food do you see on the table
just bread
really look to jesuss right the food which is a little different color than the others
it kind of looks like an egg
yes the egg marks the secret it lies directly in front of saint peter
who is saint peter
he was the disciple that jesus made into the first pope
eggsactly but theres something the church didnt tell you in actuality peter wasnt a man at all saint peter was a rabbit
peter rabbit
of course the church wouldnt allow da vinci to paint peter as a rabbit so he painted him as a man but left clues look closely
i dont see it
look closelier
he looks like a guy
look more closelier with laser technology we can look beneath the paint the way da vinci originally painted it that is saint peter the original pope of christianity
i dont believe it
proof is everywhere look at the popes hat it makes no sense except that it was originally designed for a rabbit
but why would jesus want a rabbit to run his church
because jesus knew no one man could speak for everyone in a religion men can be intolerant rabbits are pure but the catholic church buried the truth put a man in charge and the hare club for men has been decorating eggs ever since to keep the secret in da vincis painting alive
so the vatican took stans dad
you dare to mock god by telling people st peter was a rabbit
you monster you have no right to wear that hat
trying to tell people that st peter was a rabbit is blasphemy you must admit you are wrong or burn in hell
its saying stupid things like that that made jesus wanna put a rabbit in charge
im sorry i couldnt bring you the rabbit your holiness but they know where it is
the rabbit you call snowball is a threat to christs church where is the rabbit
i dont know and even if i did know well id probably tell you because i dont wanna be here anymore
take him to be tortured
tortured huh but bill all this torturing and ninjas it just doesnt seem very christian
you asked for the help of the american catholic league let us do our job take him
no no you bunny-hating bastards dont do this
i dont get it why would the pope be holding my dad hostage for snowball
i believe snowball must be a direct descendant of st peter himself and therefor the true heir of the popes throne
mr teabag get out
they found me
boys get out of here head to the woods ill try to buy you some time
check upstairs upstairs clear try the office
in here
whats that
peeeeps
so what now
if the pope has my dad i have to give him what he wants
you arent just gonna hand snowball over
what choice do i have theres nobody left who can help us wait unless maybe there is here hold this jesus i know we havent talked in a long time and i know that every time you appear we end up killing you somehow but i dont know what to do and i could really use your help
i think the rabbit just crapped on my jacket
live from the vatican its our easter vigil coverage
as holy saturday comes to an end the easter vigil at the vatican begins thousand have turned out to hear the pope and celebrate the resurrection for this easter vigil the pope is also showing his divine grace by feeding the poor with a massive rabbit stew
nooo noo no dont put m- aaaaaaaaaah
bill this seems extreme
the child who has the rabbit has to know that we are willing to kill the hostages if he doesnt hand it over
your holiness a child has arrived with a the rabbit
ya see
oh thank god hand it over stan theyre gonna kill me give them the rabbit
yes hand it over
first you have to promise you wont hurt it and that youll let everybody go
we promise
we swear it on the cross
just hand over the bunny stan
okay fine
stanley why did you do that i would have proudly died for that rabbit
you said "hand over the bunny"
no that is not the way were remembering it
take them into custody
hey what the hell
bill we have zeh rabbit its all we need
dont be soft your holiness these "whores" must be punished in front of everyone
you swore on the cross fatso
yeah too bad for you it was a double cross
oh we shouldve seen that coming
bill im not sure that double-crossing people is very christian
it is what christ wouldve wanted
who are you to say that
it cant be
jesus
he is risen he is risen let the voices sing his praises on this holy day he is risen
jesus we thought you died in iraq
i have the power of resurrection or have you forgotten you all seem to have forgotten a lot of things
jesus you did answer my prayer
actually i was answering the prayer of nick donovan
ohh thats me neato
this is exactly why i put a rabbit in charge of the church benedictus because men are so easily led astray st peter was a rabbit and a rabbit should be pope
kill him
what
he goes against the church he must die
all right that does it bill im pretty sure that killing jesus is not very christian
you are soft weak you leave me no choice take them
what are you doing
i am the pope
you are no longer able to fulfill your duties to the lord the easter vigil will go on as planned every hare club member young and old will watch as their precious savior dies
what is your problem guy
lock up those two jews well deal with them later
no no
a strange turn of events here at the vatican pope benedictus has stepped down ushering the new era of pope bill donohue
my people this easter im gonna start by making our rabbit stew ten times meatier
no listen we arent rabbits oof
forgive me jesus
well never get out in time to stop him
dont you have any superpowers
not as a mortal only in death wait thats it we have no choice kyle youre going to have to kill me
what
stab me with this if i die i can resurrect outside the bars
n-no way do it yourself
suicide is blasphemy theres no choice here kyle
dude you dont understand im a jew i have a few hang ups about killing jesus
just make it quick through the neck ill arise again immediately
dont make me do this
my son there is no time do it
eric cartman can never know about this
i understand and kyle happy easter
happy easter jesus
awgh
jesus
behold no longer will easter be about bunnies and colored eggs kill the rabbit
sorry little bunny
snowball
jesus
stop that rabbit is of holy descent
why wont you go away
one man cannot be the voice of the church
enough of this blasphemy im the pope now that means i am the voice of god
not anymore im removing you from your position
yaaay
all right jesus
sanctum piter oteum deus ore uneumhippitus hoppitus reus homine
your holiness what should we tell the world about how to run their lives it isnt saying anything
yes just as a-jesus intended it
stanley im so proud of you youve learned so very much this easter
yeah ive learned not to ask questions just dye the eggs and keep my mouth shut
thats my boy
in suspiratoreum lepus in re sanctumhippitus hoppitus deus domine
