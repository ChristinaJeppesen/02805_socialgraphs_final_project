hey look over there awesom-o the film studio commissary thats where all them rich movie producers who come up with uh hollywood blockbusters have their lunch neat-o huh
damnit mitch how come our movie studio cant come up with any winners i mean were smart right
were really smart
we need an idea for a movie thats a home run a feel-good romp for the whole family hey whats that over there
wow thats a really neat little robot you have there little boy
whats he do
well he can do anything watch this hey awesom-o whos gonna win the super bowl next year
the new orleans saints
hey mr robot how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
seventeen
mitch are you thinkin what im thinkin
yeah maybe that robot can be programmed to come up with movie ideas
exactly
gentlemen this little boy was kind enough to let us show you his robot the awesom-o 4000 ive already seen what it can do
uh excuse me sir but uh thats not a robot
its not
no it clearly had bipedal movement so the correct term is "computerized automatron"
oh very nice mitch
you are the smart one
well regardless i believe maybe this automatron can help us come up with new movie ideas
how can a robot come up with better ideas for movies than us
watch this awesom-o given the current trends of the movie-going public can you come up with an idea for a movie that will break a hundred million box office
um okay how about this adam sandler is like in love with some girl but then it turns out that the girl is actually a golden retriever or something
oh perfect
well call it "puppy love"
give us another movie idea awesom-o
yeah yeah
lets hear it
yeah we wanna hear it
come on come on
okay how about this adam sandler inherits like a billion dollars but first he has to like become a boxer or something
yes its flawless
punch-drunk billionaire
boy los angeles is great huh awesom-o can you believe those guys paid us a hundred dollars apiece for those movie ideas
you should split that money with awesom-o after all they were awesom-os ideas
hahaa right what are you gonna do with money awesom-o buy some robot pants haha no we got each other and thats all we need awesom-o im gonna send this money to needy kids in third-world countries
haaaa haaaa
you you okay awesom-o
awesom-o needs to rest feeling faint
well you go ahead and relax awesom-o weve got another full day of pitching movies tomorrow
gentlemen ladies we all know that we live in a time of uncertainty the risk of an attack on american soil is higher than ever now i believe we may be able to curb that risk two days ago our intelligence department came across this
the awesom-o 4000 it is currently being used by catamount pictures to develop ideas for movies our sources say that in just one week it has come up with over one thousand movie ideas eight hundred of which feature adam sandler
thats incredible
youre thinking the robot could be used to come up with anti-islamic movies
no if we got our hands on that robot we could re-program it and turn it into a weapon
yes that might be the best thing to do
uh huh i dont see how we have a choice
hold on a second if that robot is designed for entertainment then turning it into a weapon is unethical
unethical let me explain something to you mr scientist we understand that the robot is from japan that means that the japanese have more of them and if the japanese fabricates one of them into a weapon before we do
jesus it would be pearl harbor all over again
but worse with robots
im sorry i must protest we we have no data suggesting the japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability
youre paid to think mr scientist national security is our jub gentlemen were going to los angeles i want that robot
yeah me and my robot are still over at the movie studio aunt nellie were makin all sorts of money for the poor
movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five adam sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut
great awesom-o great uh guys take a break i need a minute alone with awesom-o
you are an incredible robot awesom-o i was just wondering are you by chance a pleasure model
what
well have you been programmed to satisfy urges of humans
awesom-o does not understand
let me show you what i mean
well yeah were havin a great time aunt nellie these movie studio guys are real nice
lame
yeah were makin a bunch more money i cant believe it either
not cool totally lame
awesom-o well i gotta go aunt nellie ah awesom-o is havin some kind of malfunction awesom-o hey whered ya go
waaaaa
lets go move move
awesom-o hey what are you doin with him
thats my robot awesom-oooooooo
are those arm and leg locks secure
secure sir
good i dont want that robot mobile until i know what its capable of all right power it on
whoa whoa wha- whoa whoa
what the hell
whats going on
it powered itself back on
stand by be ready to destroy it
where the hell am i hey why cant i move
are your systems stable run a systems check on your cpu
the fuck are you talkin about dude
ah im sorry robot they want me to reprogram you
im not a robot dumbass im alive
what did you say
i said im a real person asswipe
oh my god
whats happening
the robot it thinks its alive its developed consciousness
what how can that be
must be a malfunction of its exographical ims or the interlaced bv system
speak in a language we can understand mr scientist
your robot doesnt know its a robot
goddamnit get me down from here
who made you robot
im not a robot im a human
jesus the scientist was right
but who would have programmed it to think it was human the movie studio
look retards my name is eric cartman i live with my mom in south park colorado
dear christ they gave it memories too
sure why not program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesnt exist and make the robot think hes real makes for a lot better movies im not reprogramming a robot thats developed consciousness
do i have to remind you of your position dont forget you have a duty to your country mr scientist i want that robots memories and consciousness e-rased so we can take it back to washington got it
damn you all to hell
hey there did you know i had a robot friendwe used to laugh and play but someone took him awayhe was my ten gigahertz old palmy robot friend
hey wait a minute why thats the van that- oh my god
goddamnit stop im real im real
itll all be over soon robot
hang on im getting you out of here robot
aw its about freaking time jackass
what the hell are you doing
well i- im saving a conscious being if you wanna kill it youll have to go through me
fine kill that son of a bitch
no look goddamnit now i can show you stupid assholes who i really am
awesom-o
i am the awesom-o 4000
no no please dont kill him hes my best friend hes my best friend in the whole world
there you see you want to tell me this isnt humanity whos to judge what makes something human anyway does this make me human or this or these
perhaps there is consciousness in this robot maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence is intelligence all the same and we can learn from the robots i think maybe one day we can all- hey wait a minute did did that robot just fart
hey robots dont fart
uh now ending fart sequence
oh and it it smells too
smell sequence initiated
a robot with smelly farts that doesnt make any sense
hang on a second here
