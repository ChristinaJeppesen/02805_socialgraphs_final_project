hi jesus its me
stan marsh
of course i know you my child come in
this guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying theyre miracles my friend kyle thinks hes totally awesome
youre good to bring this to my attention stan cults are a very dangerous thing
i read in the bible that you did miracles too if you could go in front of these people and do your miracles then theyll all see that david blaine isnt so special
the miracle im most famous for is turning water into wine
can you do it again
very well i shall perform the miracle behold here you can see ordinary water clear clean okay now turn around er nuh tur- turn around uh okay now turn back it is now wine
thats it thats how you did that trick
wuh well yeah
that trick sucks jesus
oh well i guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago
dude we have to do something this guy is performing more miracles in denver tonight hes gonna get more followers and itll be impossible for me to get kyle out
then lets go
but dude id i dont think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick
ohdont worry i have a few more miracles up my sleeve
this is a really good turnout
and now ladies and gentlemen david blaine
hello my children
ladies and gentlemen may we have silence please as magician david blaine will now eat his own head
dude no way
thank you everyone our organization grows larger every day soon the government will even have to give us tax-exempt status as a bona fide religion
hold
its jesus
whats he doin here
my children it is time for you to go home and stop following this false prophet you should be using your money and time for other things these are simple magic tricks his magic is interesting but will it put food on your table feeding the hungry - now that is a miracle behold i have here fives loaves of bread and three fish certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd but now - turn around ya need tuh- turn around okay now turn back
now how the hell did he do that
wow
your magic is old and outdated jesus twah just like you are
oh really then whats this ace of spades doing behind your ear
whoa
jesus christ
hes incredible
the old religions have failed you twah what have they offered except for war poverty and sadness blaintology offers you the key to living your life to the fullest will you join us
yes
his magic is too powerful stanley ive never seen anything like it
then what are we going to do
i cannot face him alone we must get the help of all the super best friends buddha buddha come in
super best friends
this is buddha jesus go ahead
buddha we may have a problem ive just encountered a magic ive never seen before
ill call everyone together come as fast as you can
come stanley we must travel far and long
to where
distances unfathomable to man yea take hold of my robe stanley and do not open your eyes
i am ready
are you still keeping your eyes closed
yeah
good want some peanuts
congratulations sister you have heard the noble truth and are now a blaintologist
everyone everyone gather round i have great news for all blaintologists and for our new members as well weve just gotten word from mr blaine himself the government has denied our churchs request for tax-exempt status
but we want tax-exempt status
yeah why is that good news
be-cause mr blaine has arranged for all blaintologists members from every city and state to march into washington and demand our right for tax-exempt status by committing a mass suicide
mass suicide
mr blaine has said that by killing ourselves in washington we are guaranteed everlasting happiness in the afterlife
hehehe that sounds good
get your things ready we leave for washington at dawn
did you hear that guys were finally gonna die
alright stanley you can open your eyes now this is the hall of the super best friends stanley the headquarters for those who stand for whats right
jesus weve been working hard since we got your distress call
who the kid
stanley i want you to meet some of the super best friends buddha with the powers of invisibility mohammad the muslim prophet with the powers of flame krishna the hindu deity joseph smith the mormon prophet lao tse the found of taoism and seaman with the ability to breathe underwater and link mentally with fish
so you mean to tell me that even though people fight and argue over different religions you guys are all actually friends
more than friends young boy we are super best friends with the desire to fight for justice
we all believe in the power of good over evil except for buddha of course who doesnt believe in evil
wow
jesus come look at this after your distress call we entered david blaine in the super best friends computer
many interesting things showed up he was raised in new york city by a decent family but a freak washing-machine accident at the age of 12 made him learn the ways of the black arts
thats right seamen
sea man
uh thats what i said seamen
stop it
cartman cartman wake up cartman
no paula poundstone leave me alone eyuh uh
its just me
brother kyle why do you disturb my rest
dude i dont think i wanna be a part of this anymore
what
i think stan mightve been right anyway i think its going too far i mean if i kill myself its gonna make my family really sad
yeah i know what you mean i dont wanna die either i havent even gotten my pubes yet
i think we should bail if we leave the group maybe other people will get the courage to leave too
that co- ugh that could be difficult brother kyle but alright listen why dont we sleep on it if we decide to leave the faction we can do it in the morning
okay okay youre right oh uh cartman thanks cartman what the hell
i told on yoo-ou i told on yoo-ou
what have you done cartman
this is for your own good brother kyle
you must understand brother kyle twah you know too much about the church if you left now youd become a danger to our cause
ah and you know what else kyle said um kyyyle he said that if we were all gonna commit suicide that he wouldnt do iiit
cartman you fatass tattle-tale
at least im not the boy in the plastic bubble
the suicide pact will go as planned if we die we all die together
meanwhile at the hall of super best friends
look at that jesus his followers are growing at a rate even faster than mine it appears this david blaine is as dangerous as you and your young friend had feared
i knew it
here i have a videotape of his performance the other night
perhaps we should have moses look at the tape and see what he comes up with
moses scan this tape can you tell us the source of blaines power
give me the information
wow the moses
his magic is a combination of centrifugal line and sleight of hand wait a minute im picking up movement from blaintologists from all over the country
the blaintologists are heading to washington but why
wait a minute at his performance david blaine said something about trying to get tax-exempt status
omigod
what
if he gets tax-exempt status then hell become a real religion
he would become unstoppable
meanwhile in the nations capital blaintologists from all over the country have gathered to commit mass suicide
if the government will not give us tax-exempt status then we must prove that we are willing to die for our beliefs twah
alright brothers and sisters gather around its time to drown ourselves in the reflecting pool however the-ah reflecting pool is a little more shallow than we originally thought so to drown ourselves you will need to lie on your stomach face down until you die as such
next
meanwhile at the white house
mr president we cant let them all kill themselves
well we cant give them tax-exempt status either karl
he-e-ey george whats gon on
alright brother kyle it is time for us to die
cartman weve been brainwashed dont you see we dont have to do this
but its the only way for us to be happy
cartman no
give us what we want or we will continue to die
not so fast david blaine
jesus not again
yes but this time ive brought some help super best friends
buddha
mohammad
joseph smith
krishna
lao tse
sea-man
the mass suicide is over blaine and so are you
i dont think so get them
my ice breath should take care of you
kyle kyle
sweet salvation
kyle oh my god theyve killed kenny
you bastards
kyle oh my god theyve killed kenny
you bastards
oh my god theyve killed kenny
that takes care of them
now its your turn blaine
perhaps you need to see some real magic
raaargh
oh this looks like trouble
so long super best fools
kyle
stan
kyle you cant kill yourself
i dont want to kill myself they rigged this thing to fill with water
weve gotta stop that oversized abraham lincoln mohammad great scott
bliegh yugh uh okay try again hep
it is too powerful jesus
it seems to have no weakness
there has to be a way to destroy it jesus to moses
meanwhile at the super best friends league
come in moses
what
we need to know how to kill a giant stone abraham lincoln
um let me think um a giant stone john wilkes booth
you heard him super best friends weve got to make a giant stone john wilkes booth
krishna were going to need wood for a mold
form of a beaver
i will find sources to concrete you get the water to mix it with seaman
using the wood that krishna cut down as a beaver jesus uses his master carpentry skills to make a giant mold
that should do the trick now for some concrete
meanwhile in the ocean depths seaman seeks out water to mix with the concrete
sea-man look swallow we should be able to divert the water with that pipe
and so seaman and swallow get to get to work
kyle you have to hold your breath oh very funny
lao tse bring it to life
using his power of taoism lao tse becomes one with the giant stone john wilkes booth
wagh
it worked now freeze over the pool so no one else can drown themselves
hey i was just about to do it
later at exactly the same location
damn you super best friends
your magic is no match for our powers combined blaine
then i guess you win this time super best fools but ill be back
goddamnit
its alright everything is as it should be
oh shut up buddha
our leader he hes leaving us
dont leave us david blaine
listen up everyone you dont need david blaine to tell you how to live see cults are dangerous because they promise you hope happiness and maybe even an afterlife but in return they demand you pay money any religion that requires you to pay money in order to move up and learn its tenets is wrong see all religions have something valuable to teach but just like the super best friends learned it requires a little bit of them all
hes right he hes right
thanks for saving us stan youre my super best friend
your my super best friend too kyle
oh thats so sweet you guys you wanna go get a room so you can make out for a while heheheheheh
haha hehahaha
ah ow stop it ah
well it looks like everything worked out
and so jesus and his companions leave washington but their return is assured for there will always be a need for the super best friends
