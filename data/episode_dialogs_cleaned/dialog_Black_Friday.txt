the holiday season is here and black friday is upon us as you know black friday is the day shoppers go berserk for holiday deals last year 26 people died and 461 were seriously injured this winter the mall is offering 80% off to the first thirty people in the store for you new recruits perhaps you took this job to see just what the violence was like or perhaps you thought workin black friday wouldnt be a big deal
im just trying to earn some extra holiday cash
or maybe youre just too stupid to realize what youve gotten yourselves into
thats enough our only chance of surviving this years sale is by sticking together those of you who signed up are to be commended but i warn you do not underestimate the battle thats about to take place outside those doors winter is coming
good evening sir im calling together all the fighters of zauron i need to speak with lady mccormick
(shes not here right now)
please tell her there is to be a meeting in the great hall i have found a way to get xbox ones and the fair lady mccormick will want to hear about it
thank you all for coming prince tolkien sir timmy of blacklake lady mccormick warriors we have fought many great battles together at clydes house at scott malkinsons house but soon we will be fighting the greatest battle of our young hot lives winter is coming and the next gen gaming devices are hitting the shelves
which nobody can afford
what if i were to tell you that if we all worked together theres a way we can get the new gaming system
if you know of a way wizard then speak
i have learned of a dark magic at work the day after thanksgiving the first thirty people inside the mall get 80% off whatever they want they are calling it black friday
woo spooky
black friday come on that cant be real
it is real craig i saw it on the news butthole
it is real they do it every year but everyone in town tries to be the first inside the mall on black friday what chance do we have
on our own none but if we plan strategize and fight together we can be the first people inside on black friday and use the 80% to get the gaming system we need to survive
well its almost thanksgiving and we all know what that means
thats right black friday is right around the corner
ouch
and people are already gearing up
we usually start linin up around 3 am we uh douse ourselves in pig blood because it does help us slip through the crowd when the doors open
we do it every year part of the family tradition last year we lost our youngest daughter her head was stepped on and crushed but in her memory were going to find a young girl and step on her head this year
if anyone thinks theyre gonna beat me inside that mall and keep me from gettin my kids christmas presents they can kiss my fat vagina cause im bringin the motherfuckin pain
tom the south park mall says theyve beefed up security in an effort to reduce the number of fatalities this year one things for sure people take black friday very seriously
yes yes very nice good
wizard cartman i have news from the internet my lord
they dont salute in game of thrones butters
uh sorry i havent watched it yet
okay we need to start immediately please ah very good the house of greyhawk has agreed to join our fight
the house of greyhawk
larry and brad stoltsky
but my friends we must still find others who will fight by our side are there no other factions we can call to our aid
hey yeah i know how about we ask those kids who play star trek
uhh noo screw those guys theyre dorks and im not playing with them
hey thats what im talkin about you got any extra of that oh thanks gets a little boring around here you know
enjoy the boredom while you can
so you worked here last winter you worked on black friday
i did
is it really as bad as they say it is
the shoppers hm they started showing up at midnight on thursday they didnt line up they just crammed themselves near the main entrance i can see their faces smooshed up against the glass licking their lips waiting to get in god the sounds that they made it was 5 am when they opened the doors there was screaming blood people tearing each others faces off while holiday music played in the background i saw a woman pick up her daughter by the ankle and swing her into some old guys head before i knew it they were all around me fighting clawing then a hand reached in and pulled me out old cap he saved us all that day when it was over the front of the mall was covered in red bodies shopping bags and now winter comes again
well wizard cartman i started watching game of thrones
ah yes paladin butters are you enjoying it
well its its pretty good i guess but have you ever noticed that almost every time they show a guys wiener that guys character is gay
what do you mean
well ih-its just that they have a lot of girls boobs and vaginas and stuff but most times they show a mans wiener its because that guys in a love scene with another guy do you think its because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers
iiii believe you might be missing the greater point of the show paladin butters
yeah i know winter is comin and theres dragons and zombies on the way im pretty excited for that just could do with a little less gay wiener is all
we have word from the kindergartners theyve agreed to join us
those xbox ones are as good as ours
yeah
wait wait what are you talking about xbox ones
thats what this is all about craig were all trying to get xbox ones on black friday
i thought we were getting playstation 4s
what
m ma um m-me too
nnnoo guys when i said were gonna get the next gen gaming systems i was obviously talking about xboxes
yeah
eh but i want a ps4 not a crappy xbox
look guys we all have to agree on one system
thats right
if some of us are on ps4s but the rest of us are on xboxs then we all cant play together online see this is all about committing to one machine
right lets all get ps4s
no the xboxs are gonna be better
theyre not better theyre just more expensive
we are getting xbox ones guys and that is final
thats exactly how xbox people are
yeah
fine if you guys dont wanna join us on black friday to get xboxes then thats fine
were still gonna fight on black friday just not with you
oh its gonna be like that is it
everyone who wants to get ps4s join with us
no we cant divide like this stan youre on our side right
i like the ps4s controller better
stan the ps4 doesnt have the seamless transition between games movies and tv offered by xbox one
the ps4 has a touchpad interface you never listened i told you i thought the ps4 was better but you never wanted to listen to me kyle you just had your head so set because because thats how xbox people are
then i guess ill see you on black friday
if i see you at the mall kyle i will have to try to beat you inside
i know
come on kyle let these sony fucks wallow in their limited voice-control functionality
christmas is coming the goose is getting fat please to put a penny in the old mans-

bullshit
i did sharon i saw they were hiring extra security and i thought itd be a good way to make money
youre doing this to try and get to the front of the line on black friday arent you
nobody else has thought of it sharon i wont even be out in the crowd ill be on the inside when the doors open while everyone is trying to run over each other ill turn around and run right into the stores ill be the first to get whatever i want
isnt black friday supposed to be about buying things for other people

god these guys are such dorks
just find out who theyre loyal to
uh yeah big dong and prosper um listen guys uh uh youre xbox people right
given the xboxs faster frame rate we have no choice but to declare it the most technologically fit for starfleet
oh my god theyre so gaaay um kewl what if i were to tell you that we have a way for you to join us in getting xbox ones super cheap
cheap xbox ones for real
the federation has agreed to fight with us with them and the kindergartners our army has just doubled in size you still think you can convince stan to come back to our side dont you sir kyle
i dont know
you cant change his mind sir kyle sony people dont think with logic he betrayed us and now we must out-game of thrones him by making powerful alliances
oh dont even get me started i keep watchin that show and im waitin for the darn dragon to show up and and kick everyones butt but all i get is wiener wiener wiener its not all gay wiener but when they do show a straight guys wiener its all soft and floppy even though he just got done humpin a pretty girl why is that because a soft wiener isnt threatening just like a gay wiener
butters you seem to be somewhat obsessed with wieners
im obsessed with wieners well what about hbo
this isnt helping us butters
the sony people might not be our biggest problem
(what do you mean)

uhhh were just gonna wait until the ps4s become cheaper and more available
no you cant do that
ya yo you cant you cant do that
dont you see this is about more than black friday battle lines are being drawn if you wait it out but everyone else has already decided to go with xbox then that will become the standard the ps4 would be like betamax was to vhs
whats betamax

whats vhs
look were just asking people who want to play on ps4s to fight for what they believe in
sorry i guess we just dont care enough
come on sir stan there must be kids somewhere who will join us
lady mccormick i was hoping i could talk to you about kyle
(yes whats up my lord)
im not sure if his heart is in the right place if he were to ever switch sides it could make stans army problematic for us
(but stan and kyle are best friends)
true but we cant let kyle come in the way of whats rightfully ours lets face it lady mccormick this is really about you and me getting xbox ones the others are simply there to help us get inside those doors
(yes thats right)
you have a strong influence over the rest of the men lady mccormick all im saying is when the time comes i might need you to use that influence to have kyle taken care of do we understand each other
(yes i believe we do)
hey you damned kids get the hell out of my yard
fuck you dude this is the garden of andros
no its my damned garden and im sick of you kids dressin up and havin talks of betrayal in it
seventy-inch television huh that would be good oooo but 80% off a computer huh maybe ill be able to snag both

c-c-cartmans army is getting bigger every day in addition to the federation and the kindergartners the xbox army now also has the kids who play harry potter the jocks the swim team and the glee club
word is that the sixth graders all prefer xbox too and will team up with cartman as well
and who do we have on our side
uh besides us its the book club and janice pinkerton
did you ask the vamp kids
theyre still undecided
there has to be a way to get people on the fence to join our side
playstation
look sir stan its probably time to give this up
were just a dying breed stan xbox is going to win this whole thing
so were just gonna let other kids decide which game system we all play on what would they do on game of thrones what would they do when things look their darkest
huh isogashii yo
sorry to disturb you sir but we thought you should see this
omae-ya kikei jishu taihen ne winter is comingu choose side-o nani kore
just a small down in middle america but apparently a war is escalating
sir if this were to become a news story and if the first people inside their mall all got xboxes well it clearly looks bad for our image
so desu ne
whats going to be the big item everyone goes for this black friday it just might be the playstation 4 sony has just announced they offering a special black friday bundle called the "brack friday bunduru" which will include four controllers a map of japan a hundred dollar rebate and allow you to automatically pre-order for metal gear solid v no doubt sony has just raised the stakes
yes good federation kids youre learning to fight with your hands keep pushing kindergartners sir kyle i know that sonys offering a special brack friday bunduru you know the xbox is still better right
yeah but why cant xbox automatically let you pre-order metal gear solid v
sir kyle pre-order doesnt mean shit okay when you pre-order a game youre just committing to paying for something that some assholes in california havent even finished working on yet you know what you get for pre-ordering a game a big dick in your mouth
alright listen up the mall is no longer allowing people to line up for black friday until thanksgiving night its okay to hold places in line were handing out wristbands augh hold on oh god
wristbands
back back all of you if thats how you are therell be no wristbands no go
oh
back away
im getting my son that elmo doll you fuck
no
you did good the watch is yours now
no you cant die everybody really likes you
this is what we signed up for right my friend
no i was lying to you i took this job to be at the front of the line on black friday
heh now you know how serious this is whatever your intentions before protect this town you are in charge now take this dont let black friday be the end
get back inside we have work to do
when we started this fight it was because we were tired of xbox people telling us playstation sucks now we have an army of our own i cant guarantee you will live but i can guarantee that before this is over the winner of the console wars will be decided our new leader has joined us to help make sure that system is the ps4 all hail the princess
the princess yeah
