what makes a band truly great its the desire to be heard and a commitment to a three-act structure that has a 20-minute setup about an hour and a half of conflict and a big triumphant resolution so lets start at the beginning gang when did your band first form
uuummm it was about two weeks ago
yeah as a matter of fact two and a half three weeks ago id say
i hah i hah i hadnt seen my friend kyle and i hate living on a farm so i started writing songs
thats good thats good "lost a close friend put loneliness into lyrics"
yeah and then stan came to me and then i said "well i can play the drums"
but he already asked me to play the drums
well so yeah i okay ill play guitar
"inner conflict over direction of band" good
oh and then kenny learned to play bass watching youtube videos of john lennon with the dalai lama
oh no oh oh oh yeah no no we dont wanna go there talking about the dalai lama doesnt go over well with the chinese
the the the what
look for this movie to really make money we need to make sure it clears the chinese censors you know we want those chinese viewers
aw seriously
oh its okay theres plenty of other things to talk about with your story how about uh what kind of things were you into when you were younger
well i always liked winnie the pooh
okay-oh no nonono thats definitely off-limits winnie the pooh is illegal in china because some chinese students said that he looked like the chinese president
oh come on thats ridiculous
hey you wanna move away from your family right you wanna be successful on your own right
yeah
all right well you know what they say you gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of china
aaaugh i am a proud member of the communist party the party is more important than the individual
不要！求求你放过我吧！不要，不要，求求你
oh hello there
who whos there
nobody just a bear i was wondering since youre new if you might have some honey
no i dont have any honey are you prisoners here
some people said pooh looked like the chinese p-p-p-president so were illegal in china now
jesus what kind of madhouse is this
我求你原谅我。我是个很烂的人。我再也不会取笑共产党了。
你为你的国家和家人为耻。再补上十年！
不要！我求你不要！我不能再回去了，我不能再回去！
快把下一位带进来！
your honors im just a simple farmer from a simpler time now ive never been to china before but i hate to say im a little disappointed in all of you from what ive seen you seem to treat your people like dirt you dont believe in any individual freedoms i mean you got winnie the pooh and piglet in jail now come on china you know a country aint nothin unless its got decency and in-tegrity and i think i speak for pooh and piglet and all of disney when i say you could use some tegrity china now it just so happens that i own a tegridy farm and i think i might be able to work out a deal for all you nice folk
this is so awesome you guys our band is gonna be huge
yeah and were gonna be rich
(theyre the same thing)
yeah isnt this just great
hey whats wrong jimmy
fella i need to tell you something i think im homosexual and also im addicted to cocaine
oh thats okay jimmy
yeah we can get you a liver transplant
cut cut listen guys we uh just got word back from the chinese censors they dont want us mentioning organ transplants
how come
well theyve been accused of harvesting from the-look look it doesnt matter they they just said "no" to the organ stuff oh and uhh no homosexuality either
no homosexuality were trying to do a band biopic
yeah and whats wrong with homosexuality anyway
nothing unless you wanna make money in china now come on everyone back to one
all right whos the asshole which one of you decided to go and start badmouthing the chinese government haha who here thought they had permission to say anything critical of chinese politics
well it is true sir the chinese seem to exploit their own people in forced labor cam-
shut the fuck up thor youre here to flex and not speak you fucking bitch
please mr marsh was only standing up for me and piglet because we were political prisoners
you are a fat diabetic bear and if the chinese dont want you then i dont either now who the fuck is mr marsh
uhhh thats me randy marsh
who is this i dont know you are you from pixar
no im from south park
whats south park do i own that
no not yet sir
youre telling me haha that im losing chinese customers because of some shithead thats not even from my company
hey hold on a minute do you really think this business should be run through intimidation and fear whatever happened to old-time values you already have business with the chinese you have all the connections money can buy but theres one thing you dont have thats tegridy now it just so happens-
boys i understand you have a band at the school
yeah whats wrong with that
well boys it seems to me like your music is kind of angry mkay i mean its really loud mkay and its a little angry
yeah because i hate living on a farm 30 miles out of town
yeah tell him stan
i cant stand my dad anymore and if i want to do death metal i can its a free country
cut cut cut cut ah kids lets not say anything about this being a free country
aw come on
hey these guys were nice enough to come all the way from china to help us with our standards we can at least listen to their notes oh oka-okay okay actually gang we need to rewrite the whole second act
but that will take forever
come on guys everyone else is fine with china approving our entertainment even the pc babies dont seem to mind and pc babies cry about everything they just gotta rewrite the script before we continue shooting go back to your room and just write your story it has to come from your heart
its like its like they didnt even wanna listen
they didnt listen at all but i wuh-why not
its the bear theyre still pissed off about the bear
but for what
cause some chinese people on the internet starting posting pictures of their president as winnie the pooh its a real thing look it up man this is really good shit
what if we took their side then what if we showed china that we understand how they feel to be made fun of on the internet
嗯？这是什么？！你给中国人丢脸啊！
now i know how all the writers in hollywood feel
嗯？这是什么？！
my goodness pooh china sure is a big p-p-p-p-place
yes piglet it is too big i think to find what i need excuse me
huh
would you happen to have some honey
啊！我不要麻烦！我不要麻烦！走！
oh bother this just doesnt seem to be the place for a bear
wait pooh loo-l-l-look look
ooo piglet what wonderful luck what delicious honey mmm i would like to share piglet perhaps i will share in just a few more slurps i can
w-w-what are you do--wha--no ohh
i cant do it anymore you guys i cant even think with the chinese government censoring everything i write
so theres not gonna be a biopic movie for us
its so wrong you know i mean we live in a time when the only movies us american kids go see are ones that are approved by china
yeah it like china is the new mpaa
stinks to say goodbye to all that biopic money and glory
we just gotta face it a death metal band is never gonna make real money anymore the only band that would get approved by china would be all vanilla and cheesy im gonna have to live on that fucking farm forever
kyle dude youre back
yeah the migrant detention camp was kewl but it kinda rubs kyle the wrong way
anything happen while we were gone
not really we just almost had a biopic made for our band but wait a minute wait vanilla and cheesy ive got it ive got it
fingerbang-bangbang bangfingerbang-bangbangbangbangim gonna fingerbang-bang you into my lifegirl you like to fingerbang and its alrightcause im the king of fingerbang lets not fightim goin tuh fingerbang-bang-
cut cut cut this is all wrong
no its good kids theyre loving it
yeah but i cant sell my soul like this i want to get away from that farm more than anything but its not worth living in a world where china controls my countrys art i dont care how many people you have ive got something in me that just wont let me be a part of all this
yeah whatever it is i got it too
yeah
i wanna be proud of who we are guys and anybody who would betray their ideals just to make money in china isnt worth a lick of spit
us chinese people have always liked things the old fashioned way we like things a little simpler a little quieter and now theres a new weed that goes along with chinas beating heart because after a hard day of forced labor or getting beaten for criticizing the government we all could use a little time with some good ol its the soul of the american west right here in mother china all hail the communist party and all hail tegridy weed
well gang looks like the family business is starting to really turn the corner i dont know about you but i for one think the world is gonna be a better and safer place now that china finally has tegridy
dad why are you covered in honey and blood dad did you kill winnie the pooh
winnie the pooh winnie the pooh- oh yeah i did kill winnie the pooh where are ya goin stan
im going to go write another song about you
ooo about me make sure it talks about me bringing tegridy to china
