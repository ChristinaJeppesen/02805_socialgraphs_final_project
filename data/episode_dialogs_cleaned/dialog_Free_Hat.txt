oh cool a preview
coming this summer its the classic film that changed america et the extraterrestrial the new redone version for 2002 all the et effects have been digitally upgraded all the guns have been digitally changed to walkie-talkies and the word "terrorist" has been changed to "hippie"
aw dude why would they do that
yeah hippies and terrorists are the same thing
no dude spielberg changed "terrorist" to "hippie" to make et more pc
thats gay
coming this summer its the motion picture that changed america saving private ryan the re-re-release where the word "nazi" has been changed to "persons with political differences" and all their guns have been replaced by walkie-talkies
why the hell do these directors keep updating their movies
and now for your feature presentation the classic re-re-re-release of star wars the empire strikes back
woohoo
in this version the word "wookie" has been changed to "hair challenged animal" and the entire cast has been digitally replaced by ewoks
awwww
goddamnit that pisses me off
yeah we want our money back
sorry suckers
you asshole
why dont they leave those movies alone we liked them the way they were
dont you see what this means all our favorite movies are going to be changed and updated until we cant even recognize them anymore
tweek is right it isnt fair for those asshole directors to keep changing their movies and making them different movies are art and art shouldnt be modified
yeah what if they had modified the roman coliseum every year it would just be another big douchey stadium now
we have to do something lets form a club
yeah we can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit
no fatass i mean a club to protect films from their directors so they cant be messed with
yeah well be the "save films from their own directors" club
yeah
no nono ah i dont wanna form a club thats too much pressure look ah-im supposed to take it easy just watch the clouds sit on the grass and if we form a club therell be responsibilites commitments

you guys you guys oh god um ive got terrible news
what
ted koppel wants us to appear on nightline to talk about our cause
really thats great
yah
no it isnt man thahats waaay too much pressure
if we go on nightline the whole country can hear about whats happening to our classic films
but just remember that i do all the talking
you why
because im the official spokesman i got dibs on it
when did we do dibs for it
just now - 1 2 3 dibs
me
ga-ahah
alright fine youre the spokesman cartman but youd better not screw it up
what could possibly go wrong
a new movement is sweeping the country led by four determined boys from south park colorado the organization was created to protect hollywoods classic films from the hands of their directors and also to free hat mccullough so boys i ask you the question thats on everyones minds why does your organization want to free hat mccullough the convicted confessed serial murderer of twenty-three babies
i believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman tweek
gaaarh
well hat mccullough admitted he killed those toddlers why do you want him free
oh jesus man nahah
just answer me this tweek what do you see as "positive" about toddler murder
ahah u-uh its easy
yes it is easy alright then on to your other cause saving films from their directors what got you boys interested in this especially given your pro-toddler-murder status
we believe that films have to be taken away from people like steven spielberg and george lucas because theyre insane
well im glad you said that boys because joining us now are steven spielberg and george lucas
oh christ wwwaaaaaaah
hello ted
oh hi ted
gentlemen these toddler-murder fans think youre insane and shouldnt be allowed to alter your films your response
well first of all both george and i are very firmly against the murdering of toddlers
hear hear
dude thats steven spielberg and george lucas
get me out of here please somebody get me out of heeerre
and as for altering our films all were doing is trying to reach a new audience with our movies as the makers of dreams we like to speak for the children
ah we thought we were speaking for the children
yeah were children
uh-look if the beatles went back and updated their white album every few years what would we have now
yeah these guys are only motivated by money ted
how so
think about it spielberg jew lucas jew kyle jew coincidence
im not a jew
you little brat- ah i mean you darling children dont know what youre talking about changing et was the best thing i ever did
dude dont you see that its not itd be like changing raiders of the lost ark
wait a minute whatd you say
eh thats brilliant
yes change raiders of the lost ark why didnt we think of it before
no noo
members this is our darkest hour weve just learned that george lucas and steven spielberg now intend to update and change raiders of the lost ark theres only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed mr secretary
thank you our intelligence tells us that the original negative to raiders of the lost ark is currently somewhere in george lucass house we need to find and usurp that negative
and if we get a hold of the negative they cant change the movie
that is our understanding
sounds like a good idea to me i dont want them to change raiders of the lost ark
yeah
yeah we should go get that negative as soon as we get hat free
yeah free hat free hat free hat
nonono we need to do this first
but we have to free hat
its just that you know he killed twenty-three babies
well yeah but it was in self-defense
yeah
he killed twenty-three babies in self-defense
hat was attacked maliciously and unprovoked by a gang of babies in west town park when that many babies get together they can be like piranha
three eyewitnesses testified that if hat hadnt killed those babies theyd have killed him
yeah free hat free hat free hat
alright alright but right now weve gotta focus on getting those original prints of raiders
hes right wed better split up some of you go with the boys and get those film prints the rest of us come with me to go talk to the governor about freeing hat
yeah free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat free hat
well it looks like were gonna have to do this ourselves
no thats it im out i cant deal with the stress you guys create
were just gonna fly to california and break into george lucass house whats stressful about that
hwaaah
okay tweek let me tell you something youve been our new friend now for two weeks okay and ive gotta be honest with you it isnt going well
haaah
people arent that into you tweek they find you kind of annoying now i say youve got one last shot here and i dont want you to blow it okay does that help take the stress off
okay go
im not breaking into george lucass house im not breaking into george lucass house im in a green field
stop tweek this is not the time for faggocity
this looks like the right room
im in a field surrounded by deer
over here
thats it
alriiight get it tweek
huh uh
get it you piece of crap before i grab your nutsack and twist it
guh huh huh
what are you doing
oh god oh jesus
youre the boys from that stupid club give me that
aaaaaah
do with us what you will mr lucas but please dont change raiders of the lost ark
were gonna make it better the movies gonna be changed and thats that
alright you asked for it im afraid you leave us no choice its time for plan b
aw really
oh god no not plan b
you have a heart made of ice mr lucas and so were goin tuh melt your icy heart with a cool island song gentlemen
what
hit it tweek in the tropical isles with the coconut trees theres a lots of-
waitwaitwaitwaitwait i thought we were gonna cool his hot heart with a cool island song
no he has an icy heart
but you cant melt ice with a cool song r-tard
so we have to warm his icy heart with a "hot" island song
its a cool island song
well then were gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song
oh do we wanna do that
alright that does it
yes thank you officer the police are on their way boys soon youll be in jail getting rammed
aaaahh
those rams can do to us what they will mr lucas but well never stop trying to protect films
its not too late to do whats right give us the print theres still some good in you mr lucas we know there is
it is too late for me boys
you yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films you understand why films shouldnt be changed
m-thats different these are my movies i made them and i have the right to do whatever i want with them
youre wrong mr lucas theyre not your movies theyre ours all of ours we paid to go see them and theyre just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours
when an artist creates whatever they create belongs to society
have i become so old that ive forgetten what being an artist is about
give the print to us so that we can protect it from spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it
perhaps you are right
stop what are you doing george
steven uh i-
give me that print george we need to make the alterations
steven these boys had a point i dont remember what it was but it was good
you havent let these doe-eyed children affect your judgment have you george dont forget you belong to me
dont listen to him you still have a chance to preserve your film
im ah im sorry boys
now take the children prisoner
what
you troublemakers shall be my guests of honor at the premiere of the new raiders of the lost ark your gay little club is over
fuck you steven spielberg come on you guys
oh my god theyre gonna kill us
dont even think about it kid im not afraid to use this walkie-talkie
the one with the cocaine-problem escaped mein direktor
leave him let him run back to his mommy we must get the film ready for the premiere lucas come
coming this summer its the digitally-re-enhanced re-release of the very first pilot episode of south park yes the classic rough hand-made first episode is getting a make-over for 2002 the simple funny aliens are now super-badass and kewl the flying saucer no longer cheap construction paper but a 40 megapixel nondrop digital masterpiece of technology yes everythings new new is better
when we first made south park we didnt wanna use construction paper we just had to because it was cheap
and now with new technology we can finally remaster south park make it look sharp clean and focused
expensive
yes all the charm of the simple little cartoon will melt before your eyes as it is replaced by newer and more standardized animation
for instance in the scene at the bus stop we always meant to have imperial walkers and giant dewback lizards in the background but simply couldnt afford it
get this special enhanced version quick because another enhanced version will likely be coming out for 2003
members uuhh oh jesus uh we have to do something our club president treasurer and secretary have all been taken hostage by steven spielberg haaa
prisoner you mean like hat
yes just like hat
but the governor wont pardon hat so how can we get him out of prison
no listen to me were not talking about hat right now okay gad look we went to george lucass house a-and tried to melt his icy heart with a warm island song but then spielberg showed up and took three of our members prisoner theyre goin to premiere their new raiders of the lost ark and we have to rescue them do you understand
hey hes got a point there
yeah maybe we could melt the governors icy heart with a cool island song
yeah
no
no
no hes right we have to freeze his hot heart with a cool island song
or is it freshen his hot temper with a cool island song
lets cool his hot temper with a fresh island song
thats it
lets go come on
oh god im gonna have to do this myself oh god
well the print is finished and the day has come tonight steven spielberg and george lucas will be at the premiere of the new special edition of raiders of the lost ark lots of celebrity guests and other rich people will be on hand to witness all the updated effects and modernized technology
hello

yeah well sometimes the things we do dont matter right now sometimes they matter later we have to care more about later sometimes you know i think thats what separates us from the steven spielbergs and george lucases of the world
that and youth those guys are old
but what about the original prints of raiders of the lost ark what if somebody else takes them and tries to change them
dont worry tweek its somewhere safe somewhere where nobody will ever find it
