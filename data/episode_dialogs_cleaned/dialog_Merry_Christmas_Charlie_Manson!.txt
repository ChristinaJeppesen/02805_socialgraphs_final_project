you see i had a family once at least i called them my family really they were nothin but a gang of people i thought were my friends ah after we killed a bunch of people together i realized that my real family was who took care of me and who took the time to care about what i did
but they dont care about me they just want to punish me
if they dont care about you would they have driven nine hours to nebraska
i guess youre right uncle charlie thanks

okay grab a hold of him youre under arrest buddy
all right you spread em
youre going back to prison to rot manson
good i deserve to
what
i can never make it up to the families that i destroyed but at least ill make an example for anyone else thinking that crime is an answer
stop that
you see i get it now i finally understand what the holidays are all about boys dont you see you cant let things get you down during the holidays because being happy is what the holidays are all about
charlies right im not gonna let some fake mr hankey spoil my holidays
ive been such a bastard all these years and i finally understand and it it it feels great if i feel like- i feel like im in my own christmas special you seeholidays are that special timewhen we laugh and sing and feel warm and cozyforget about being angry for a day remember how it felt to be a childopening presents on christmas mornin thats the way that we should all feel nowso i say happy happy happy happy holy happy happy happyholidays

hooray uh i mean wait what
and so manson is hauled off to jail to rot in his cell everything is back to normal and i guess the only thing left to say is god bless us everyone
"and i guess thats what ive learned im sorry for what i did but that doesnt make up for it i deserve to be in jail all i hope is that i dont make mankind lose faith in itself yes theres murderers in the world theres rapists and thieves but those are the vast minority the majority of mankind is made up of caring people who try every day to do what they think is right and thats the spirit of the season" what do you think guys
it sucks just like all your other books
well guh good night you guys happy holidays
shut up

merry christmas charlie manson "hark" the herald angels sin"glory to the newborn kingpeace on earth and mercy mildgod and sinners reconciled" joyful all ye nations risejoin the triumph of the skies"hark" the herald angels sing
