butters people cant just go around beating up people who have diabetes now whatever your problem is you just-
you just think you know everything dont you kyle every little thing you gotta shoot your mouth off like youre the frickin expert well you dont know everything because your best friend is a kid who thinks the entire planet revolves around him and he only cares about his image you guys think cartman is the only selfish piece of crap in this school youre all fake and stuck up and none of you have the courage to tell jimmy that his jokes arent funny the only kid here with any sense of dignity is kenny and the rest of you have your heads up your butts
well apparently kenny is butters best friend you guys gonna make out kenny
and thats another thing youre always trivializing everything i say by gettin the last word well youre not gettin the last word this time

uhbu-but im from here
no we moved here just before you started pre-school you were born in our native land butters a distant and very secluded island world called havai
were from hawaii
only haoles pronounce it hawaii butters but those of us from havai are a very special people we have many customs and traditions to keep our culture alive we drink chi-chis from the coconut we eat poke that the safeway provides and when weve chosen a mate we marry at the fern grotto as your mother and i did so very long ago as a stotch butters you are actually hawaiian royalty your grandma and grandpa were there at the time of the king
but what does being hawaiian have to do with me acting like an emo chick on her period
not an emo chick on her period butters like a salmon needing to swim back upriver all hawaiians feel it it is called "hapahui apahoha" and it means its now your time to make your trip to our island home you must do your walkabout to your homeland butters and you must do it alone take this son it is our mahalo rewards card it will provide you with all you need and now i must turn my back on you

"on the morrow" what the fuck is wrong with kenny
kenny
in the time-honored traditions of our ancestors we honor the native hawaiian butters stotch with his hapa noa the shark-tooth necklace represents your connection to our island now drink the chi-chi
whoa its like gasoline
drink young keiki and you will feel the last of your aggression melt away
hey uh now i do feel butter uh better
o spirits of ancestors we ask that you bless this native hawaiian with his hapa noa we ask that you-
listen listen everyone i have terrible horrible news
do you realize that you are interrupting a hapa noa
ive just come from the front office the mahalo rewards card is
what what has happened speak
the mahalo rewards card is being eliminated theyre trying to say our points are are no longer going to be accepted
i knew one day it would come to this
to what what does this mean
the haoles are trying to do away with us
with no rewards program there will be no distinction between whos a native to this island and who isnt
why cant you people respect our island why do you always want nore
im sorry keiki your hapa noa will have to wait for we must unite together as never before it is time to show the haoles that this is our island
stop ruining our island haoles fire
what are they doing
take a swing let them know they are not welcome
ive never done this before
its all right just try to tap into that anger thats inside you
aim my anger stupid ben affleck waaah
hold on hold on
oh i cant i cant i cant hold on
i love you i love you
no i love you i love you back
this is breaking news
an insurrection in the hawaiian islands has escalated to war after sinking a cruise ship the natives of kauai continue to go berserk forcing all tourists off their island
they just pushed us onto airplanes and said we werent welcome anymore
then a little boy called me a skank
the president says he will send the coast guard to take the island back though he sympathizes being a native hawaiian himself hm
are all the tourists gone from our island
all but a few who are hiding out at dukes restaurant we sent bob and trisha turner to smoke them out
what about him
(what about me)
hes a tourist and he knows everything we have to kill him
no kennys my friend hes the only kid at school i actually like you buncha jerks
be careful young keiki your anger still controls you because we were not able to finish the ceremony perhaps we should finish it now
finish his ceremony we are at war david i have lived on this island for ten years ten years every july and part of august and i can tell you all that what we are about to face from the haoles is nothing short of genocide
hes right david we cant trust any tourists
he wont betray us will you kenny
(no im not going to fucking betray anybody)
then let him prove himself trial by opahikaa
hes only a child
if he wants to be one of us then he must face the challenge
very well
this isnt right hes not a native hes gonna get killed
kenny be careful
quiet he must face this challenge alone
by the gods perhaps he has the heart of a native after all
he still has yet to make the turn
hohhh
thats pretty good
(whoops)
kenny
awwwww
i told you a haole couldnt do it
did you make the turn your first try did any of us
dont worry butters your friend will find a way back to his kind the gods will protect him
we have called for this great meeting because if we are to survive this war all the native hawaiian tribes must join as one
were not joining the people of the hyatt grand vacations they have no rights to call themselves natives
oh and you do your ancestors came on an airplane six months ago our ancestors sailed here on a cruise ship nine months ago
look if we are to fight the haoles we have to allow all natives to stay
it doesnt matter how many tribes we have we cant win we are but a few against the haoles military might we may have passion but passion does not win wars
oh no come up here keiki come on this child sunk a cruise ship by himself tell them keiki
well i dont know about the rest of ya but im sick and tired of bein pushed around all the time i came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony and i cant even have it cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything
yeah
screw them
well if you ask me the only good haole is a dead haole with a with a stick up his butthole and his wiener cut off rraahhhh
let us make a pact with more chi-chis
um were were out of chi-chis
oh right weve closed off all the ports
but theyre still letting vodka through right uh they cant cut off our chi-chis
oh my god
this is the us coast guard we have instructions to take you by force if necessary
ready fire
fire
arm the bocce balls
god damn it
keep fighting stand your ground
we cant fight without chi-chis
you can and you must
stupid greedy haoles kill them all
come on come on you know what chi-chis are right
listen everyone we gave it all we had its over we must go down to nowiliwili harbor and surrender to the american government
surrender no the heck with that
we cant hold out here any longer
well i wont do it you hear me im not licking anybodys testes
young keiki try to control your anger
no this is our home and im sick of everyone who thinks theyre better than me just cause theyve got good looks and just cause even after massacring daredevil they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes you shouldnt be able to be good-looking and be with jennifer lopez and be a good director all right all right fine argo is a good movie there i admitted it i told people that it didnt hold up but it holds up god darn it ben affleck has everything gragh
everyone look i say
the haole did it
kenny
we are not surrendering today go back and tell your leaders that we will fight them until the end
you people just dont give up do ya
kenny
kenny
and so it is with great honor that we recognize these two natives with their hapa noa take your cards boys apuiloa hapnanoaha hapaaa hohaaa its finally over young keiki is your anger at rest
yeah i guess so except it still doesnt change the fact that ben affleck gets to be handsome talented and then gets to go home and kiss jennifer lopez
ben affleck isnt with jennifer lopez anymore hes married to jennifer gardner
yeah its true uh huh
what really but i thought i was totally jealous of him hes just married to jennifer gardner oh my god i feel so much better
(you do)
yeah ogh i like that ben affleck guy hes a good filmmaker come on kenny i guess i owe the kids at school an apology did you see argo kenny its a pretty good movie ben affleck has a lot goin for him not everything but a lot whoopie
