hey stan whered you get that black eye
nothing i mu-i mean nowhere
your sister beat you up again huh
no
eheh you know heh your sister kicked your ass
shes just pissed off cause she got headgear at the dentist shes taking it out on me
yeah but that sucks to get your butt kicked by a girl stan
i would never let a woman kick my ass if she tried anything id be like "hey you get your bitch ass back in the kitchen and make me some pie"
my parents dont even believe that she beats me up they think shes all innocent and sweet but i know that shes an evil bitch
be a man stan just say "hey woman ye-you shut your mouth and make babies"
hey kyle whats that elephant doing
you mean this one
yeah
hes my new pet elephant
whoa dude whered you get a pet elephant
i got it mail ordered from africa the ad said it would take 4 to 6 weeks but it only took three
wow thats cool
no its not cool my mom wont let me keep him in the house she says hes too big and that his poop is bigger than our couch
thats why my mom got me a pot-bellied pig cause its poop is small
(hey you guys i talked to garrison and he told me that theyre almost the same)
well yeah but pigs arent smart like elephants
hey wait a minute what is that thing
uh oh this this is the new retarded kid
ohâ€”im sorry little girl but you still cant get on you have to take the special ed bus
boy it looks like youre not welcome anywhere elephant see ya
if a woman ever gave me crap id say "hey you go do my laundry and-"
sit down kid
yes maam
and now children our friend mr hat is going to tell us all about genetic engineering
thats right mr garrison genetic engineering is an exciting new science you can splice the dna from some animals and make them better
mr garrison
yes kyle
with genetic engineering can you make an elephant smaller
well uh ye yes i suppose you could you could splice elephant genes with a dog or cat or a pot-bellied pig genes
thats it im going to combine my elephant with a pot-bellied pig and makepot-bellied elephants
theyd be smart like elephants but small like pigs
thatd be cool
i want a pot-bellied elephant
yes ill pay fifty dollars for one
thats stupid
shut up terrance we can geneti-cal engineer anything we want
oh yeah i bet i can genetically clone a whole human being before you crossbreed and elephant and a pig
ill bet you cant
watch me plebeian
well spank my ass and call me charlie isnt this exciting two a+ students in a cloning war
yes mr garrison genetic engineering lets us correct gods horrible horrible mistakes like german people
you know you boys might want to visit the genetic engineering ranch outside of town for some help and you could both use this for your science fair projects next month
genetic engineering ranch sweet
wait wait we still need a pig
we can use cartmans pig
ehh you leave fluffy out of this
were not gonna hurt her we just need some of her blood
youre not using any of fluffys blood or else ill kick you in the nuts kyle kyle no
uh uhuh stanley can i talk to you for a minute
okay
i couldnt help but notice that black eye you have are there problems at home
yes
oh dear here stanley sit down have some cocoa and tell your friend mr hat all about it
im your friend mr hat stan you can tell me anything now who hits you is it your father or your mother
oh neither its my sister

yes my son
hi shelly
are you looking at my headgear
headgear what headgear
are you looking at my headgear
oh uh gosh uh i didnt really notice
you little liar
no i think it looks terrific it matches your aaaaah
ready to go stan
go where
to the genetical engineering ranch
we got cartmans pig so we can splice its genes with my elephants
nobodys splicin nothing from fluffy
i swear im gonna kill you stan
whys your sister so mean to you dude
yeah if some sissy chick tried to kick my ass id be all like "hey listen missy eh yewhy dont you go knit me sweater before i slap you in the face"

hey im taking my pig andscrew you guys im going home this whole ideas stupid anyway
what the hell would you know you fat sweaty mongoloid you never get higher than a d
hey why dont you go back to san francisco with the rest of the jews
theres no jews in san francisco you retard
ill kick you in the nuts
can i help you
mmmmmm
uh yeah we want to crossbreed an elephant with a pig
brilliant idea huge elephant-sized pigs
no no no we want to make little pot-bellied elephants that people can keep in their houses as pets
ohh thats an even better idea come on in
im so pleased that you children are interested in genetic engineering
eh its okay fluffy nobodys going to hurt you
its thanks to the wonders of genetic engineering that soon there will be an end to hunger disease pollution even war i have created things that will change the world for the better for instance here is a monkey with four asses
mhhh
how does that make the world better
and here of course is my four assed ostrich and my four assed mongoose
do you have anything besides just animals with four asses
oh uh i suppose so uh oh yes over here here i have rats splice with ducks and gorillas spliced with mosquitos and here i have rabbits spliced with fish to make little bunnyfish
heyyy these bunny ears are tied on with little strings
and over here swiss cheese spliced with chalk and a beard
well what about our pot-bellied elephant
oh well im sorry children but pig and elephant dna just wont splice havent you ever heard that song by loverboy
which song is that
diindoon - pig and elephant dna just wont splicealthough maybe i could help you add a few asses to that swine of yours
you can keep your hands off of fluffys ass
you know its amazing what we can do with a little blood sample these days
ow
hmm what oh excuse me
wait what are you taking stans blood for
oh pardon me i tripped could i have some hair please
watch out stan genetic engineers are crazy
come on fluffy
this fish is just hurting my anus
naw its pretty fresh
uuuuhh i sure am hungry
ello gentlemen any of you blokes know whats for lunch today
lunchy munchies hmmm
go away pip nobody likes you
yeah what kind of name is pip anyway
well my fathers family name being pirrip and my christian name being phillip my infant tongue
god damnit would you shut the hell up nobody gives a rats ass
yeah go away pip
righto
gah french people piss me off
hey dumb-asses you morons give up on your stupid science fair project yet
no were already halfway done
halfway then all youve got is a stupid pig
yeah its probably a gay pig too
stupid gay pig
its more than youve got
wroong weve already got our human clone well under way
oh my god they cloned a foot
ugh hey ill kick your ass
eho
by friday were gonna clone a whole human being good luck with your stupid little pig
hello there children
hey chef
how you doin
bad
why bad
we need to genetically engineer our pig and an elephant but their genes wont splice
ahhhh of course they wont splice children havent you ever heard that song by loverboy
dooodnnndoodnn - a pig and an elephant dna just wonta pig-elephant say now thats not a bad idea
i told you guys
imagine a pint sized elephant that you could keep in the house children we could make a fortune with this
you hear that dudes well be rich
forget about all that genetic engineering whoosafudge if you want to combine a pig and an elephant just get them to make sweeet love
whaaat
i dont think an elephant would make love to a pig
i dont think my pig would want to make love to that stupid elephant
sure they would but youre gonna have to get em in the mood
so how do we do that
do what i do get em goood and drunk
hey uh you guys want to come over to my house
weve got work to do stan i think it takes a while for an elephant to get drunk
really you you guys dont want to come over for just a little bit
why is your sister gonna kick your ass again
shut up cartman
(or are you gonna hit her with your hand)
yeah stan shes just a girl
yeah if some girl tried to kick my ass id be like "hey why dont you stop dressin me up like a mailman annnd making me dance for you while you go and smoke crack in your bedroom and have sex with some guy i dont even know on my dads bed"
cartman what the hell are you talking about
im just saying youre just a little wuss thats all
stan you can use family love as a weapon against shelly the next time shes gonna kick your ass just tell her "shelly youre my sister and i love you"
("and i want to see you handling your breasts")
sick dude shes my sister
try it well see you in a while we got to go get cartmans pig
no you dont gotta get cartmans pig you leave fluffy out of this
come on kenny
kyle no seriously no fuckin elephant is going to make love to my fluffy i kyle i will kick you in the nnnnuts
crap
and now back to jesus and pals on south park public access
are you staring at my neck-brace
no i mean yes i mean what neck-brace
shelly before you beat my face into a bloody pulp again i just want you to know that that youre my sister and i love you
no ahh someday shelly im gonna be bigger than you and youre gonna wish youd never done any of this to me
youll never be bigger than me stan never
beautiful its absolutely beautiful my son i think weve finally done it
yes we have dad my very own human clone
hopefully not a gay clone
yeah that was stupid
stupid
that was stupid
come on elephant keep drinking
damn i wonder how drunk he needs to be to make sweet love to the pig
dammit this is never gonna work
hello children i thought id check and see how our little entrepreneurial venture is going
rotten theyre both really drunk but the wont have sex
ohh children you just cant stick a drunk pig with a drunk elephant and and expect them to do the mattress mambo you need to set the mood
let me show you boys what im talking abouttonight is a-right for loveyou know i -- want tuh touch you where the lights dont gotonight is a-right for love love gravyexpressing love so sweeti want tuh -- keep you burnin like a dog in heattonight is a-right for love love graaavaaay

hey look its working
now children gather around and watch the wonders of life the beauty of mother nature
aah
sick
fluffy
hmm now i know how all those white women must have felt
how luscious our creature has come to fruition boys
dad youre the best
oh my god he only has one ass hes of no use to me ill have to burn the room
oh no this entire experiment is turning out very bad
me bad
eeegads hes out of control well have to destroy him
but hes our science fair project
uhhh me baad aba-ba-chewy-chomp
hes too dangerous son
but dad i want a human clone
son no
oh son youve made a horrible mistake youve put all the people of south park in jeopardy
theyre all stupid anyway come on guys lets go
yeahh theyre all gay
arent they ever gonna wake up
oh they will its gonna be one uuuugly sight
i thought you said the wonder of mother nature was a beautiful thing
yeah when does mother nature go from beautiful to ugly
usually about 930 in the morning children
uh oh here we go
yeahhh theres nothing worse than getting all drunk and waking up the next morning next to a pig
or a big fat elephant
hey how do we know if shes pregnant
well boys we might not know that for a couple of days
couple of days but terrance is going to have his human clone by tomorrow
well good job einstein why dont we just build a rocket in the meantime
hey
oh thank buddha i found you boys you must tell me have you seen anything odd lately
uh we saw an elephant have sex with a pig
no no i said odd
hey youre that crazy cracker from up on the hill
sir if making mutant animals spliced with humans is crazy then uhhhhh hmmm oh nevermind im afraid theres been a bit of an incident at the ranch you see ive created a large mutant clone of that little boy there and hes broken free
(a big mutant stan)
a big mutant version of me
is he bigger than a regular clone
hes terribly dangerous his brain is identical to yours i need you to help me find him
ah chewy-chewy-chomp
oh my gooodd
stan are you wearing a different hat
uhhhyahhuhhh
hey i know a certain young man whos itching for a detention

ooooh
how big do you think he is
i bet he weighs four hundred pounds
come on stan dont you even know where you would go
(look at that whats he doin)
oh my god
aaaah
it appears that the horrible destructive creature is actually eight-year old stan marsh of south park when asked why he was wreaking so much havoc on his home town the little boy replies simply "me stan ba-chomp ba-chewy-chomp ba-chewy-chomp back to you in the studio
thanks tom police are requesting that if you see this little eight-year old boy you immediately kill him and burn his body thats all for now
now back to jesus and pals
-- yea the way is paved with gold for ye who seek truth and-
ba-ba-chomp-betchaba-chewy-chewy-chomp-aaah
jesus
its-to-the-left-mayoueyea
officer barbrady my evil genetic clone is destroying the town we have to find him
you boys have been watching the "x-files" too much theres no such thing as genetic clone -
ahhhh
whoa listen uh you kids go on home theres nothing to see here
come on lets go
there you are stanley you tore up my entire gun shop you better have a good explanation for this mister
it wasnt me uncle jimbo it was my evil genetic clone
stanley what the hell has gotten in to you you have got severe lunchroom duty mister
im gonna go have a word with your father stanley
yeah you wait til your father hears about this
wait stan there he goes
stop
ahhh ba-ba-chomp

come on kyle cartman
ah
what the hell do you want
chewy-chewy-chomp
ahhh uhhh
boys boys im lusciously sorry for everything
hey theyve got our clone he belongs to us
no son this beast is a disgrace to genetic engineers everywhere boys im sorry ive caused you such - inconvenience i tried to play god and i failed
daddy nooooo
all i ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful but i failed perhaps we shouldnt be toying with gods creations perhaps we should just leave nature alone to its simple one assed schematics
you cheating bastards this isnt over just wait until tomorrow
oh my god they killed kenny you bastards
mom and dad are home my house is a disaster you guy- you guys have got to help me
i aint helpin crap i want to eat some paeh
you cant just leave me here alone
oh yeah watch me

oh well stan were uh were sorry we jumped to conclusions
oh honey please forgive us son
shelly you you saved my life and yet youve done so much more than that today youve taught me the meaning of family sure families dont always get along but when the forces of evil descend upon us we conquer them by sticking together
uh ahh oooh
everyone lets give casey and his weed a big hand
okay kyle were ready to see your science project
well our pig hasnt given birth yet but she should anytime now
oh well then i guess you get an f okay terrance i know the class can hardly wait to see your science fair project
thank you mr garrison boys mr garrison fellow students for our science fair project bill fosse and i have spawned a creature genetically far superior to man i present to you the five-assed monkey
ahhheh
oh mr hat isnt it beautiful
wait wait the pig just gave birth it it had a baby
it had a baby
oh wow
whats it look like
does it look like a pig or an elephant
hey it kind of looks like mr garrison
ohh uh gee isnt that an amazing coincidence hmm what are the odds of that
hmmm you boys get first prize
thatll do pig
