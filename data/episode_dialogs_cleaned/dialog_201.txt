the denver broncos there was a right tackle see who had an illegitimate child with your slut of a mom and everyone here covered it up to protect the bronco name
they were having a really good year there couldnt be any distractions
my dad was a denver bronco
would you like to meet him well you cant ever cause you see eric we have something in common did i ever tell you that my father played for the denver broncos
no- nooo
the only bronco who lived in south park he got a little bored one week and had an affair with a slut named liane cartman
no please
tell him you almost did before but you got shot by your brother who was a bronco fan tell him
its true jack tenorman was your father
you killed your own father and then you fed him to your half brother
no noooo
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha now eat your chili the super best friends oh no
ill get you tom cruise
hey look tom cruise has seaman on his back
what did you say
oh yeah tom cruise does have seaman on his back
i guess maybe tom cruise likes seaman
whoa whoa whoa whoa youre not supposed to be able to make fun of me anymore what the hells going on
ill be back super best friends
whos the creepy ginger kid
reiner you said the goo machine would work but i got made fun of
thats because there is no goo mr cruise you see i learned something today throughout this whole ordeal weve all wanted to show things that we werent allowed to show but it wasnt because of some magic goo it was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence thats obviously the only true power if theres anything weve all learned its that terrorizing people works
thats right dont you see gingers if you dont want to be made fun of anymore all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop
thats right friends all you need to do is instill fear and be willing to hurt people and you can get whatever you want the only true power is violence
yeah
alright people lets start rebuilding our town for the 39th time
oh dude look hey cartman
look man w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear
tough to hear my dad was scott tenormans dad dont you guys realize what that means
yeah dude we we know what it means
my dad was a ginger
wwait what
i mean obviously i take after my mom but i have the ginger gene inside of me
dude you killed your own dad and youre worried about that
hey eric eric
what
come on cheer up

theres a bounty on my head and i cant afford to stay in one place for too long so long denver bronco
take it easy conner
look mr cruise im sorry i said you were a fudge packer and that you had seaman on your back
i just cant do it anymore i wanna go away but theres nowhere on earth that people arent around to rip on me
hey hey we know a place we know a place where everything is just happiness and joy and no humans are there to mess it up
we do oh oh yeah we do
you really somewhere where i can just live out my days in peace and quiet and- oh oh please can you show me where
