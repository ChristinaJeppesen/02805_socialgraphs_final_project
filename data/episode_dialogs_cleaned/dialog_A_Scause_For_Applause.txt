oh i feel like such an idiot
its all right dad
but i wore that wristband everywhere and the guys a complete phoney theres even more coming out about it today
these latest tests are once again confirming that the performance-enhancing drug hgh was in the body of christ at the time of crucifixion all over the country people are having their "what would jesus do" wristbands cut off it was just last week a team of scientists found traces of hgh on the shroud of turin along with several other illegal compounds and painkillers
without a doubt there was uh hgh in the body of christ at the time of crucifixion jesus did not suffer for our sins he was in fact very high
all the years of being told somethin its just so unfair
priests and bishops have been working overtime to remove jesus from the record books and from the last supper
i know people that paid ten bucks for those bracelets i bet they all feel pretty stupid now
yeah and so and so then i asked preacher "well what about the new testament"
uh huh
and he says "well you still should oughta read it but youre gonna need to put an asterisk next to jesus name whenever it comes up"
so weak dude dark times brah dark times dude what the hell youre wearing a "what would jesus do" bracelet

yeah yeah thanks charlie my problem with this kid is he doesnt care about the truth okay if jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs thats fine but then he went on to say it was a miracle and that is where it became dangerous what about the incas what about the aztecs millions of people who were murdered in jesuss name and then jesus turns out to be a fraud wearing that bracelet is a slap in the face to everyone

i dont know i like it
all right well we searched high and low to find my next guest who actually agrees with stan marsh and thinks hes doing the right thing please welcome a retarded fish now retarded fish you dont see any problem at all with someone keeping their bracelet

mr marsh if you dont mine wed like to see your bracelet

if you have nothing to hide then please hand it over mr marsh
what are you people talking about
are we good we live tom im here at south park elementary where officials have barged their way in after reports of stan marsh of the stanground foundation did in fact at one point remove his yellow bracelet rumors have surfaced that stan did not stan his ground as previously stated and that the wristband is in fact superglued back together
please let us check your wristband for superglue
no this is stupid
hes the one person who doesnt do stuff like that why dont you leave him alone
are you afraid we might find glue on your bracelet mr marsh
no i never cut if off
then let us ah-see it
this is an outrage who out there is saying that our friend stan is a liar
i cannot say but he is a reliable and credible source who is of the utmost prestige
who
all right it was craig
craig you asshole
whats the big idea craig
it just looked like you cut it off thats all
you got nothin better to do than try and knock me down you cant just say anything you want about people
ooo look at him go stanning his ground
yeah
you know what happens when you lie craig you hold that lie inside
go stan
and it grows and it grows right in your balls until they have to cut it out
a little unnecessary but go stan
go ahead and test it then lets just see what happens to this money-hungry alcoholic prostitute
yeah
prostitute
this is breaking news
the tests are done and the results are in the little boy who claimed he never cut off his "what would jesus do" bracelet did cut it off and lied about it
not only did we find traces of ah-superglue but of yellow magic ah-markeur as well this is a dark ah-day for honest french-swedish people everywheure
though the tests seem conclusive stan marsh continues to deny any cheating
yeah

p-yeah instead of focusing on us we need to get everyone focusing on what matters wheres belaruh-ruh-roos

maybe if we could get people to care about it then i could go and save it and people would be stoked on me again
how can we raise awareness
we need to get some bracelets
welcome welcome to the pf pityef bracelet factory how can i be of service
well we wanted to start a new movement and we thought since your company makes all the bracelets
ah i see youre wearing one of our brown scauses already delightful what color would you like your new scause to be
our scause
well of course you came for a scause to wear on your paws and you want others to wear yours upon thaurs
im confused
hm perhaps i should start from the beginning in the modern age there are those who believethat a cause is a thing to be worn on ones sleeve and so we sell a cause its called a scauseand wearing a scause gets you lots of applause we start with some plastic which is shirped by our shirpistthen dip it in colors that show off your purposethere are green scauses for recycling blue scauses for kitties and pink scauses that focus on nothing but titties do you hate abortion ah then a white scause is for you why not champion your scause with some sparkles and gluewe make scauses for this we make scauses for that why theres even a scause for just being fat whats the matter cant think of a scause how about raising awareness for the hairs in your schnozzlets just think of the thing that you care about most then lets make it orange like marmalade toastand now id like to say "thank you" for your coming downim off to go sell these in your little town
dude the hell just happen
kids kids okay i need to talk to you about a serious matter you probably all noticed my orange wristband mkay its to show my solidarity with the people of belarus mkay you should know that the belarusian government is right now trying to-
we know mr mackey we all have our belarus bracelets too
oh you do ya you got you got those okay okay thats good good youre doin something about it mkay uh hey kids kids over here
dude whats this about orange bracelets where do you get them
theres a guy selling them downtown but theyre not made from recycled plastic

yes you do
oh i guess i do care about that huh
hey stan well some people are sayin that you knew what you were doing all along that that you you cut off your wristband on purpose to shed light on the belarusian farmers
people are saying that
yeeah is it true
wow you know whatever it takes butters people are aware of the problems in belarus maybe i did it all on purpose or maybe it was just a coincidence
heyah whatever stan yeah i thought you were a butthole but n-now i think youre a cute sneaky little butthole
we did it
it has become the biggest concern for most people the farmers of belarus and their plight against their government and now one person is taking it upon himself to end the crisis his name jesus
these are very troubling times and these farmers are literally fighting for their lives you know im uh ah-im here just to do whatever i can
jesus some people might be thinking youre doing this as some kind of a publicity stunt to put to rest the rumors of your drug use
you know ah i dont even have time to think about that this is a crisis that needs my attention and im just here to do whatever i can ive talked to the government here and ive talked to the farmers and i think we have everything just about worked out
aaaah
you know whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me it doesnt change the fact that the people of belarus need my help
ah i believe its belarus jesus
yes it very well may be if we dont do something now
um so you think youve something here to keep the conflict from escalating is that right
im just doing what ive always done people wanna know what im on what am i on im on a farm in belarus busting my ass what are you on
uh huh and now that the belarusian farmers are all dead what will you try next
what aw shit
one at a time please one at a time

oh my its the sound
wu-what sound
of all sounds in all sounddom this ones most profound thats the sound that means i must pack up my tent its the sound of the last cent being spent my work here is done and just look at you now youre all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow enjoy all your scauses you look great in your cause be sure to give each other lots of applause im off to the next town in my little truck have a nice day toot a loo
fuck dude weak
its almost like like that guy had this figured out all along
yeah
we were trying to do good but we got everyone duped by a bracelet company
yeah well i guess were just gonna have to accept that people arent gonna think very highly of us
well we cant just let that guy get away with taking everyones money
what can we possibly do
what would jesus do yeheah
vengeance is mine
no please please show mercy
get out
thank you my children weve all been through a lot we got caught up in scauses that didnt mean squat they turned my message away from the teachings it hid and made it about me and the things that i did which of course i didnt do and even if i did use performance-enhancing drugs so did all the other prophets but i didnt so what have we learned from this great wristband theft maybe that when stripped of our scauses only causes are left and causes shouldnt be worn on our wrists with a sneer lets keep our causes where they belong which is right here on t-shirts free pussy riot
free pussy riot
yeah
