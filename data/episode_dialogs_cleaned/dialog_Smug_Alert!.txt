thanks
at least were smart enough to know better
thanks
come on everybody be people now
and so we are here to honor stan marsh for making south park the city with the highest percentage of hybrid owners in the country
if only the rest of the country was as insightful as we are
ah thanks i was really just trying to make it so my friend can move back here so if you dont mind im gonna try to get a hold of him now
great speech
yeah well you know my son is just a little bit more clever than some
hello there im ranger mcfriendly im the person who watches over the delicate ecosystem of south park you must be the little boy who wrote that song
yeah
uhh
ow
you son of a bitch do you have any idea what youve done
what
come with me
there look
smog theres never been smog over south park before
dont you get it when people drive hybrid cars they get so full of themselves they spew tons of self-satisfied garbage into the air that isnt smog its smug
smug
hybrid cars make better for emission levels but people who drive hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug you can have smug in the atmosphere and you know what that leads to glodal laming thanks to your gay little song south park is now the second smuggiest city in america
this is a south park news weather bulletin
it looks like we have a smug alert here in south park our own keenan williams has the details keenan
thanks tom a smug alert is in effect at least tomorrow morning all those hybrid cars on the road have caused heavy smug to develop over most of park and jefferson counties on the national map we can see smug over denver and developing smug in los angeles however san francisco is once again the smuggiest city in the country
a smuggy day in san francisco town
sheila did you meet gail and brian
no hello how are you
really good really good
hey there alan right
actually its alain
right right w-would would you like red or white wine
can i just get an empty glass
oh sure
can you believe all these imbeciles in texas they just put another prisoner to death
so what do you do for fun
we drink and take drugs
do you want some acid
oh no thanks we dont do that stuff
you will theres a reason most san francisco kids take a lot of drugs
its the only thing that allows us to deal with our parents all walking around loving the smell of their own farts all the time
everything okay in here kyle
yeah fine dad
so much better here with the intellectuals isnt it boys wuhh mmmm
well maybe ill take just half a hit of acid
i want three
no no im asking if theres a listing for broflovski in san francisco they just moved there
haha take that jew boy i guess you heebs cant even play video football
yeah youre right
you know butters you make for a lousy jew
well im sorry well its just that im not jewish and now th-
no no dont apologize you asshole
marsh
oh crap ranger mcfriendly
who
youd better come with me to the news station our situation just got a lot worse
i noticed it on the computer this morning look here this is the smug over south park its getting bigger and gaining strength
the smug
the smug is getting so massive that its moving west and fusing with the san francisco smug here these two smug clouds are combining fueling each other now take a look at this
what is that
its the smug from george clooneys acceptance speech at the academy awards
george clooneys acceptance speech
did you hear it he talked about how people in hollywood are ahead of the curve on social mattes he even took credit for the civil rights movement -look the point is the smug from his acceptance speech has been slowly drifting north since he gave it and is headed straight for the super cell the south park and san francisco smug is already at critical mass if it gets hit by george clooneys acceptance speech it will be a disaster of epic proportions the perfect storm of self-satisfaction
weve got to tell the townspeople south park still has a chance to make it through the storm
what about san francisco
kid thanks to your gay little song theres not gonna be a san francisco
soo thats it people when the smug from george clooneys speech hits the san francisco and south park smug were gonna witness a storm the likes of which weve never seen
are you trying to tell us the smug from our hybrids is actually gonna kill us all
if the smug clouds remain the way they are yes
this is all stans fault he wrote that gay little song and got us to drive those damned hybrids
yeah good going stupid
listen though we all agree this is stans fault there is still something we can do if we all work together to reduce smugness we might be able to lessen the effects of the storm at least here in our own town
then thats it theres only one way to reduce smugness weve gotta destroy every hybrid car in town
everyone get your hybrid and meet at dawsons
hey where do you think youre going
im gonna try and warn kyle to get out of san francisco
oh no youre not your gay little song got us to drive hybrids youre gonna help us get rid of em
how long do we have until the smug clouds collide
not long the smug from george clooneys academy awards acceptance speech has already crossed into arizona
the hell is that
wow eric you sure are a great guy for doing this
i dont have a choice somebody has to get into san francisco and warn kyles family to get out before the storm hits
but how come we cant just take the bus on into the city
you dont know san francisco butters it was the breeding ground for the hippie movement in the 60s those hard-core liberals lesbian activists and die hard modern hippies young and old i swore i would never set foot in san francisco god help me all right butters ill be tethered to you through this cord its my only lifeline so make sure it stays taut if you stop hearing my voice for the love of christ start reeling me in with all your strength
i will youre really great for going to warn kyle eric
im not doin it for kyle i cant believe im actually going to walk through san francisco well here it goes
all right all right now get it into the masher hurry up
cant somebody else operate this i cant really reach
well then you shouldnt have written that gay little song shouldnt you have keenan weve gotten rid of half the hybrid cars how are the smug levels
theyre dropping slowly but but were running out of time
yeah its like san francisco is more of a european city like paris or milan
butters are you there
im here eric
ive started to enter the smug im about a quarter mile in can you give me an el
you must be nearing union square did you see a fountain to your left
yes its just beyond yet another wine and cheese store
wait uhh eh take your next right youve got to start heading west
turning right at o two four niner
thats it thats that the last one
keenan keenan weve smashed the last hybrid
harry the smug from clooneys speech is about to hit the other smug system get everyone inside god help us
butters butters i think im here 2419 castillo
thats it eric hurry somethins goin on out here
mr broflovski mr broflovski there a smug storm we have to go
being smug is a good thing
oh my christ kyle kyle
the acid dude im totally tripping balls
im totally tripping balls im totally tripping balls
we have to get out of here now kyle kyle
and now the worst appears to be over last nights smug storm has left thousands homeless all across the midwest people are picking up the pieces cities like denver and south park are heavily damaged but still all right however san francisco im afraid has disappeared completely up its own asshole
no
im sorry stan im sorry your gay little song killed your friend
hey hey stan youre not gonna believe it youve gotta come see
what
its a miracle
kyle
hey stan
dude what happened
we dont know we were all passed out and next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here
its like you had a guardian angel mkay
dude im so glad youre not dead
so i guess theres nothing left to do now but rebuild
yeah first off were all gonna need new cars
and lets make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid right
no hybrid cars are a good thing
but hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug mkay
hybrid cars dont cause smugness people do look hybrid cars are important they may even save our planet one day what you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it
you mean drive in hybrids but not act like were better than everyone else because of it
yeah
im im not ready
i dont think i can do it either
its simply asking too much
perhaps one day we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it but for now the technology is just too much for us
come on everybody lets go buy wasteful gas guzzlers
well looks like youre back for good huh kyle
yeah i guess so
we just cant get rid of you can we you sneaky jew rat
dont belittle my people you fucking fatass
ah thats better
