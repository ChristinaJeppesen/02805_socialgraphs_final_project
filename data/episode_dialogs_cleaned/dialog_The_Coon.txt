the city isnt what it used to be it all happened so fast everything went to crap its like everyones sense of morals just disappeared bad economy made things worse the jobs started drying up then the stores had to shut down then a black man was elected president he was supposed to change things he didnt as more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear dark times the city needs protection there is an animal that lives by night searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage to clean out the trashcan of society ive chosen to become more than a man im the hero this town needs i am the coon as the world plummets into despair the coon fights to keep order intact
lisa i had a really great time tonight
i did too josh

dont let the citys peacefulness fool you commissioner its too quiet
oh not this kid again
hey you get out of here out
there was another rapist in the park tonight its no coincidence it must be a rapist plot and it stinks to the top
what
i think the mayor might be involved its my theory she might have a lesbian lover whos holding her leash
jesus christ can we get a lock on that window look kid you need to stop-
hes gone
no im just over here now what do we know about the mayors sexual preferences
alright listen you have five seconds to leave or were gonna put you in the jail and call your parents

now im back over here
just get out of here before we-
im right here now
all right stop it
yes i have to go now but in the meantime i have something that might interest you make sure all your men get a look at these detective
whats in here
hey guys good morning you guys hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night they say it was the coon
whos the coon
i know right "who is the coon" its what everyone must be asking themselves somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands as for me i certainly dont agree with the coons reckless ways if you ask me theres no room in this world for vigilantes i believe the coon is a menace
yeah and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway
youre a fag kyle fuck you
dude what
hes not a fag
why do you care
oh i uh well i ah ah im just im just mad cause you should never use the term "fag" kyle thats a hate word and its insensitive to butt pirates anyway what do you think about the coon stan and kenny do you think hes the savior this town needs or do you think hes a dangerous vigilante kenny
and of course the most common question asked is just who is he is he a hero or a menace while we can all admit that the coon is obviously really cool we should also be asking each other "why does he care so much for the people of this town why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime and does he really have the right" what we all need now- clyde clyde could you wake up please this is important what we all need now is proof that the coon exists i believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 545 the coon is going to be on the roof of walgreens i know ill be there with my camera and im sure many of you will too
sometimes it seems the more criminals i try to stop the more just come out of the back alleys and dilapidated bars the city is a dying whore she calls out to me to save her and i dont know if i can but she is still my city and i cannot just sit and watch as innocent peole are- who the hell is that who the hell are you
im an angel keeping watch over the city at night as violence and darkness take over the streets i work to rid this city of crime im the symbol this town needs
aw nonononono i am the symbol this town needs dude seriously you cant do that go home i was i was doing this first
nuh uh
yeah huh you heard of the coon and now youre being a copycat is that your name copycat
i am mysterion
mysterion thats fucking retarded you just gave yourself away craig only you would think of a name that dumb
i might be craig and then again i might not be my identity must remain a secret you cannot know
yeah well you cannot know my true identity either
i assume you must be cartman because youre fat
well youre wrong im not eric cartman and hes not fat care to guess again
i really dont care who you are
oh all right kyle yeah took me real long to figure it out only you kyle would be a buzzkill and try to steal my thunder you dont care about stopping crime youre just doing this cause you hate me kyle
kyle hates eric cartman are you saying youre eric cartman
no im no- i im sayin that goddammit stan is that you it is you isnt it clyde clyde youre not a superhero i am
i cannot stand here and make idle conversation any longer the city needs my help there are innocents to protect
no dude im seriously youre being a copycat ill sue you motherfucker
which one of them is it somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero but who has to be one of the guys in my class cause only they knew that the coon would be on the rooftop of walgreens no stop cant think about that right now have to focus tomorrow is the most important day in the coons life everything the coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow concentrate
how is it that nobody came to coonicon 09 this is just this is fucking ridiculous
got everything you need here sir okay on beverages buffet items

you have an entire wall dedicated to mysterion what about do you do you still have that "who is the coon" t-shirt i gave you
oh yeah i think its around here somewhere uh using our photos we are tryin to pinpoint mysterions identity
why is cartman crossed out he he could be mysterion
no hes too fat based on his body type its gotta be someone like stan or kyle
alright al alright alright look chaos just set up a video camera i know how we can put an end to mysterion once and for all
the clock is ticking and the citizens of south park are gripped in fear two days ago an evil unknown terrorist threatened major consequences if mysterion does not reveal his identity
mark my words south park your precious hero is now uh your undoing if mysterion does not unmask himself publicly by wednesday night i am going to blow up a hospital blow up a hospital im not gonna blow up any hospital are you nuts what uh the choice is yours mysterion unmask yourself or hundreds will die hahaha jesus christ
since the threat was issued there has been no sign of mysterion where is mysterion

if you dont make good on your threats chaos then what good are your threats
but you really wanna blow up a hospital i mean a-arent you a good guy
sometimes blowing up hospitals is for the greater good chaos

you know youre a little scrotum-licker dude why dont you shut the fuck up alright chaos im gonna get the triggers for these things at ace hardware keep an eye on this stuff
aww jeez general disarray this is a lot more than i ever really intended i mean well i hate the world and all its puny inhabitants and all but but blowin up a hospital it just seems mean whoa oh hamburgers

well wait i thought we were workin together waaa oh jeez i think i broke a tooth
that was great teamwork mysterion south park is safe until next time
what next time
well people are obviously so desperate to learn your identity that theyll do anything wont be long before the next villain comes along and threatens violence unless you take off your mask
citizens tonight has shown me i have no choice but to unmask myself
dont do it mysterion if you show your identity well be forced to arrest you for being a vigilante
dont you think he knows that but superheroes know that sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself for the greater good
dont show your face mysterion
you have to be a symbol
so that the next terrorist can threaten south park if he doesnt unmask himself
no its true as long as my identity is a mystery this will just happen again and again it has to end i will show my face
ohhh
well ill be
i knew it was you member i even said it before
wow a kid from my class was mysterion
well im sorry but youre under arrest take the kid to jail
my entire plan worked to perfection my work here is done with mysterion out of the way the coon can finally go back to keeping the city safe once again i alone am the symbol this town can stand behind every town needs a hero every town needs a coon
