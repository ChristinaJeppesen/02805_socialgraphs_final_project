comanche helicopters
then well need 57 flamethrowers all set up around the perimeter of the disk that are all triggered to fire at the same time
flamethrowers triggered at the same time
once lit the snake will grow
and good times will be had by all
wonderful
spectacular

mr hat on the other hand
mr hat was gay
sometimes he fantasizes about same-sex relations
i see
sometimes mr hat liked to pretend he was in a sauna with brett favre and a bottle of thousand island dressing
that i did not need to know
well im just sayin
mr garrison i think that mr hat was actually your gay side trying to come out you see its-its you thats gay but but youre in denial soyou act out your gay persona with a homosexual puppet
what do you think about that
i think youre the loony one in this room
serves you right you gay-bashing homo
