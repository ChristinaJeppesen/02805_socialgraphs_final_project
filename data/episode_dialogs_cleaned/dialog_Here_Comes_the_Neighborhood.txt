using my laptop computer i hooked into the internet and found a meteorology web site i donwloaded the data and with my dads video projector i can show you the graph i made of predictable weather patterns over the next three months
wwooww
i also printed out the results on my color printer here you are ms choksondik
very very good tolkien you get a check plus
alright
aw that is such bullcrap
eric for the love of god
no no see this is the fundamental flaw with the check check-plus check-minus system the only reason tolkien was able to do all that is because his family is rich
my family isnt rich
oh come on tolkien your new house is four times the size of anyone elses in town and who else gets crab cakes and and lobster tail in their lunch boxes
your family is rich dude
but i
lets just see where tolkiens clothes come from shall we ooooo armani exchange

yeah dude your family is so rich they have their own pool table
yeah and their own sprinkler system you dont think youre rich
hello tolkien how was school today
mom dad why do we have a bigger house than everybody else in south park
well because we have more money son
i know but why
w-well because we went to graduate school and therefore have more lucrative jobs than most people in town for instance your mother is a chemist for a pharmaceutical company whereas your friend eric cartmans mother is a crack whore one pays more than the other
why sweetie whats the matter
all the kids at school made fun of me today because im rich
oh
i dont wanna be rich anymore i wanna eat macaroni and cheese for dinner and and wear clothes from j mart
j mart

ooo look at this honey a beautiful unspoiled town in the rockies this is just what weve been looking for
"like aspen was 30 years ago" sounds nice
we could buy hundreds of acres of land for next to nothing and then i could finally live like a cowboy
oh will the country would be such a nicer place to raise our kids
o kids
yes daddy
how would you like to move to the colorado rockies
the mountains daddy
can we have horses
o can we can we daddy
you bet
hooray
well here it is our home to be
oh will its beautiful
hi welcome to the neighborhood
why thank you young man were the smiths
ah a local boy you shall be our new playmate im frederick this is my sister lisa and my brother daniel

yes yes we have one of those too in fact we have seven of them i believe
you do god thats great
why
im just so happy you guys moved into town you see i used to be the only rich kid all the other families here are kinda low to middle-income
why what happened to all their money
well they never really had any money
well then why dont their daddies just act in a movie
well i think that they
sometimes children must be very firm with their daddies
indeed
like when daddy doesnt want to act in a movie because he thinks the script is bad
so we must plead with him "please daddy please its twenty million dollard daddy"
"please daddy please"
"twenty million is still twelve million after taxes daddy"
"i want a llama daddy"
"id do the picture daddy"
"please daddy"
"daddy please"
"daddy do the movie daddy"
"but daddy"
and so daddy does the picture
thats great
twenty million dollars great

a billion billionaires are gathering their ranks and will be marchng on the town square tonight in south park to petition the end of separate bars bus seating and restaurants it looks like it will be a great turnout as some of the millionaires also paid several thousand mexicans to march for them
if they get that petition passed its all over
i guess we learned our lesson you cant fight rich folk theyre just too powerful
now come on is that any way to talk
they won garrison they cant be scared out of town

everyonen get some sheets from home if we cant chase the richers out well spook em out
alright yeah lets go right
huuuunh aslan
yes what is it young lion apprentice
i thnk im gonna go home now
home but i thought your friends made fun of you at home
they do but i guess i learned something today you see even though kids at south park make fun of me i still like hanging around them more than snobby rich kids or lions even though i may be different from them i still like my old friends best
it sounds like you learned much young lion apprentice very well but before you go perhaps you would like a stick of gum
no thanks

no because theres a spring in there and if i pull the gum out its gonna hurt my finger
oh so you dont want any gum then are you sure go on try it
