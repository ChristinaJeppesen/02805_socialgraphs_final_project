chanukah chanukah sivivon sov sov
i gotta go tinkle
no ike shh
sov sov sov sov sov sov ma nayim vi-tov
we thank god for our blessings this chanukah our little family is so loving and perfect and nothing will ever tear us apart ill get it
gerald broflovski
yes
my name is harry gintz and this is my wife elise were from canada
yes i can tell
my wife and i had a child a few years back and we werent ready to have a child so we put him up for adoption we were told that you might be the-
peter oh god harry its our son peter its mommy
gerald what the hell is going on
im not sure
it was a tough time for us it was a tough time for all of canada the whole country was devastated by the cola wars it just seemed we couldnt take care of a baby
so we put him up for adoption but as the years passed i i just felt an emptiness in my heart oh its so good to see him
well we wish you all the best mr and mrs gintz but to be honest i think it would be best for ike if you didnt come around again
i dont think you understand we didnt come to visit peter we came to take him back
what
we want to take peter home to canada
are you crazy
look you gave ike up you cant just change your mind
changing your mind is a canadian custom that we hold quite dear and besides the new canadian prime minister has issued a decree that all adopted canadians must be returned home
the new canadian prime minister
look ike is our son now
he doesnt belong here he belongs in canada with his own kind
i think youd better leave
please dont make things any harder for peter
harder for peter now you two just blow in here and say youre gonna haul him back to canada and were being hard on peter
were prepared to go to court we had hoped it wouldnt come to that
well you bet your ass itll come to that
im sorry to say that my hands are tied the new prime minister of canada has authority this court cannot override by canadian law i must award custody of the child to his birth parents
yes
yes
no
ikes not my little brother anymore
gerald do something
theres nothing i can do
good-bye ike you be a good boy huh you remember all the things we taught you
ike youll always be my little brother okay
come on peter we should get going
no
peter you must come with mommy and daddy
no no no no no
i have some chocolate
chocolate
were going to take good care of him
youd better dad cant we talk to this new canadian prime minister if he knew the situation he might be-
oh kyle appealing to the prime minister of canada would take time and money we dont have
dude look at that sprinkle time make your own marshmallow factory im definitely asking for that for christmas
dude im gonna tell my parents to get me that john elway doll with the karate-chop action
guys guys i need your help
sure dude
its been a week since ikes been gone and every day my parents seem worse i have to try to go to canada and speak with the new canadian prime minister but i cant do it alone
we cant go to canada dumbass its christmas
yeah dude what if we miss out on some great christmas adventure
please you guys you dont understand my family is devastated my mom just walks around the house like a zombie and my dad cant stop crying
well i didnt wanna say anything kyle but i think this is what your family gets for being jewish at christmas time
dude cartman

i found the number for a really cheap airline to canada if we go as soon as possible then-
dude we just cant up and go to canada look theyre about to light the christmas tree maybe you can get your brother back some other way
kyle i just want you to know if it were any other time of the year i still wouldnt help you
three two one yaaaaay
as we celebrate this glorious time we cant forget those families who are suffering as many of you know the broflovski family has recently had their child torn away from them as a community we must do all we can to ease their pain are there any suggestions how we might help
how about we get rid of all the mexicans
mr garrison every christmas you suggest we get rid of all the mexicans and every christmas we tell you "no"
rats
the broflovskis need money to appeal that case to the new canadian prime minister what if this christmas instead of buyin presents we all use that money to give to the broflovskis
ha yeah right like our parents arent gonna buy us presents for christmas
thats a great idea chef
what
yeah who needs more stuff anyway this christmas we can do somethin that really matters
dad dont get carried away
then its settled this year well give all our christmas money to the broflovskis in hopes that they may someday have their child returned to them
no no this cant be happening
you fucking asshole this is all your fault
what
everyones gonna be charitable and give money to your family instead of buying christmas presents you fucking jews ruined christmas again aaaaaa
whoa whoa cartman
it wasnt enough for you people to kill jesus now you have to kill christmas too huh
cartman calm down

im sorry you guys but there is something we can do we can go to canada and see the prime minister like i said if we can change his mind before christmas then your parents wont have to give my family money
