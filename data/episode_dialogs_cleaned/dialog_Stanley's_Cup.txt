stan marsh was supposed to win it all the big game a dying boys hope only problem is he tied and now hes about to find out that tying isnt the same as winning
so did we kill nelson or not
hello
coach
how are you feeling
i feel pretty good except for the cancer coach does god hate me
oh hello coach
uh hi doc hows he doing
well he isnt worse but he isnt getting better its almost as if his cancer were tied
oh boy
oh my cancer hurts
he seems to have put all his hope into you winning that game and with a tie hes in a kind of cancer limbo
but what can i do
stan marsh stan marsh great news our hockey team has just been invited to play against denver county during a colorado avalanche game
wow at the pepsi center
look hes coming around again
thats our biggest game ever do you think we can win coach
well ah i mean
imagine if there was one game one chance to make everything right stan marsh is being given that chance but to win hes gonna have to pull out all the stops in "stanleys cup" rated r
yeah yeah well beat em
all right maybe there is hope for me
just be aware of this coach if you lose the big game that little boy is going to die faster than steve irwin in a tank full of stingrays
coach what the hell were you thinking
we cant beat denver county
well sure we can
last time we played denver they scored seven times
look guys i believe in you nelson believes in you doesnt that count for anything
no cause theyre gonna kill us
theyre not gonna kill us
thats what steve irwin said about those stingrays
havent you guys ever seen these movies were just supposed to rally together believe in ourselves and we win in the end
no in the movies they always go out and find a kid whos really good to join the team
hey thats right we need a ringer
we need a canadian
wow hes good
yeah
stan i told you my mom doesnt want ike playing hockey she thinks its dangerous
its just for one game he wont get hurt i promise
yeah
all right but its gonna take more than one good player to beat the champions stan youd better have a really good game plan
can you believe it stan the pepsi center youre going back to the place where it all happened same place where you missed that shot all those years ago
dad im working on my game plan right now
ya have to understand why i cant go i cant sit there in that same crowd and watch you destroy yourself again oh stan of all the places why does it have to be the pepsi center all right all right ill go no no i want to go im gonna be there for you and ill be rooting louder than anybody saying "thats my son" and just remember stan win or lose those are your two options win or lose
his shot is blocked what a great save and thats the end of the second period the score is tied 2-all and now please put your hands together for three minutes of exhibition play from some of our states finest pee wee hockey players
all right you guys this is it the moment is here weve been through a lot together and according to every movie ever made were going to win this game just dont forget theres a little boy in the hospital whos really counting on us so lets not let him down are you with me all right lets go win
