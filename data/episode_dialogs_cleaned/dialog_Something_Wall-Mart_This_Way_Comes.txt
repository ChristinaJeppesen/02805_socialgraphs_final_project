hehe you stupid fools have no idea that im actually working for the wall-mart to stop you from succeeding
goddamn that took a long time
it wouldve been faster if cartman hadnt slashed the tires
i did not i wanna close wall-mart just as much as you guys do
can i help you
yeah weve come to complain we dont want a wall-mart in our town
who does nobody likes what the wall-mart does but it keeps right on doing it
we want to talk to whos in charge
in charge i guess that would be harvey brown hes the current president of wall-mart one of the original creators
wheres he
we invented the wall-mart super center in 1987 the idea was simple build a store for one-stop shopping where bulk purchases could keep prices incredibly low we didnt know what we were doing in just four years it was out of control
so how do we stop it
you dont stop it
there has to be a way
theres nothing dont you understand nothing can stop the wall-mart in your town unless of course you can find and destroy its heart
the heart of wall-mart
sir dont you think youre talking a little too much
every wall-mart has a heart somewhere near the television department destroy the heart and you could reverse the entire process
you speak too much sir
why dont you guys just destroy the heart
because the wall-mart stops you many have tried kid union leaders nature activists even the best fair-trade lawyers tried to stop the wall-mart and now they are wall-mart shoppers all
all right cmon you guys we have to get back home
it wont work dont you understand it isnt gonna stop until theres nothing but wall-mart left jesus what did we do what did we do boys tell the world im sorry
no dude dont
thats ten bucks you owe me dick-face
all right this is it if wall-mart has a heart we have to find it and destroy it no matter what the wall-mart does to try to stop us we have to be strong lets do it
im afraid not kyle wall-mart is a great store i could not let you fools ruin its terrific bargains you see i was working for wall-mart all along
i knew you were
no you didnt
yes i did i said from the beginning that you would do this
no you didnt
yes i did
no you didnt
yes i did
no you didnt
yes i did
no you didnt
yes i did
you see kyle it was me who slashed the bu-
-slashed the bus tires in arkansas i said so i told you the minute that i- -and i told you that-
i cant hear you lalalalalala im sorry boys but if you want to hurt the wall-mart youll have to go through me
we dont have time for this kenny keep him away from us
very well kenny let us battle ow kenny k-kenny knock it off
welcome to wall-mart
save it grandpa
weve gotta find the television department
boys these axes are only four ninety-nine
dad we know how to destroy the wall-mart
shhhhh what are you talking about
one of the creators told us you have to take your keys over to the television department
television department all right come on lets go oh my god
what
those two-dollar salt-and-pepper shakers they were three dollars five minutes ago the wall-mart is lowering its prices trying to stop us
come on weve got to try to make it to the back
gaaah dont look dont look at its bargains
i think i see the television department in the back
is that the right way dad dad dad
the screwdriver set is only nine ninety-eight
come on dad
i cant make it boys youre gonna have to go on without me

there the television department
hello boys congratulations on getting this far
who are you
i am wall-mart
you
ive taken this form in order to talk to you but i can take many forms does this suit you better or perhaps you prefer this form i can take whichever form i like
we dont want your store in our town we come to destroy you
wheres the heart
to find the heart of wall-mart one must first ask oneself "who is it that asked the question"
me im asking the question
ah yes but who are you
stan marsh now wheres the heart
ah you know the answer but not the question
the question is "where is the heart"
very well you want to see the heart of wall-mart it lies beyond that plasma-screen television
its a mirror
yes dont you see that is the heart of wall-mart you the consumer i take many forms wall-mart k-mart target but i am one single entity desire
well the guy in arkansas said to destroy the heart
gaaah no no what have you done now you shall see my true form now you see me as i truly am
wed better get out of here
get out its gonna blow
dad come on weve gotta get out
too late for me son i have to buy this stuff
the wall-mart is imploding everybody out now
boys you did it you killed the wall-mart
how did you do it kyle
all wall-marts start a self-destruction sequence if you break a mirror in the back
we know how to destroy it now spread the word to all the towns
wait i think i understand the symbolism of the mirror the wall-mart is us
duh
you see boys if we like our small-town charm more than the big corporate bullies we all have to be willing to pay a little bit more do you understand
yeah lets all go shop at jims drugs down the street
oh lord kumbaya
all right lets not make that mistake again
yeah lets all shop over at true value
lets go yeah
