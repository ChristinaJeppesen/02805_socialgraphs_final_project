no
well let me put it another way you have to give your oral report to the entire south park town committee tomorrow and if it doesnt kick ass and you make me look bad mr hat is gonna smack you bitches up
wagh
hello there customer
hello how are you today
great what can i get for you large coffee small coffee
im actually interested in something else im john postum from the harbucks coffee corporation
oh youre that corporate guy whos been calling
thats right how come you dont call me back all we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here
oh forget it my store is not for sale
my companys prepared to make you a veerry generous offer this is a cramsonite briefcase all leather it has four compartments and a keyless lock interested
uh i dont think so my coffee shop is worth a lot to me
well all right how about $500000
the answer is still no mr postum you see when my father opened this store 30 years ago he cared about only one thing making a great cup of coffee sure we may take a little longer to brew a cup and we may not call it fancy names but i guess we just care a little more and thats why tweek coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster yes tweek coffee is a simpler cup for a simpler america
well thats too bad were just gonna have to open our harbucks right next door to you
but that could put me out of business
hey this is a capitalist country pal get used to it
hello mr tweek

i know how you boys feel sometimes a hot cup of french roast amaretto is just what a man needs to get him through the day that smooth aroma and mild taste is what make tweek coffee uh very special special like an arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew a light rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt--
dad

thank you mayor i dont wanna sound like a dickhole but i-
mayor these boys want that harbucks coffee shut down right now
yeah
yeah
well i cant just shut them down this is a free country
but theyre ruining our city
look the best i can do is create a proposition well call it prop 10 the town can vote on it and if it passes well see what we can do
hooray
hooray
what do you say boys were gonna pass a law
uh hooray
so i guess you wanna do some campaigning you can do commercials and things like that and then well have a vote in the middle of town and obviously if more than 50% of the people even show up
wagh
and care enough to want harbucks out then theyre out so good luck to you
didnt you see them
alright whats next
next is issue 37d missing underpants
is it cold in here
uh boys can i have a quick this and that with you boys i dont know who wrote that report but now that youve convinced everybody youd better stick with it cause if these people find out you didnt really write that paper and i actually do get fired then mr hat is gonna do horrible things to you oh not that mr hat thats really horrible anyway good luck passing your new law boys
jesus man jesus what are we gonna do huh
live its the south park town hall meeting on public access tonights topic prop 10

boo
hey im not fat or smelly
all right mr douchebag
postum
oh pardon me mr assface anyway lets hear your side of the argument

my argument is simple this countrys founded on free enterprise harbucks is an organization that-
hhssssssss
an organization that prides itself on great coffee we simply want tuh-- oh to hell with you

great argument you win boys
what
that was close mr hat
what is the future of america is it the money we make the quests we conquer no its children so what do children have to say about prop 10
i dont like big corporations
i like small businesses
i believe in the family-owned enterprise
(in my family its a silly enterprise)
aarrgghh
its time to stop large corporations prop 10 is about children vote yes on prop 10 or else you hate children you dont hate children do you remember keep american business small or else paid for by citizens for a fair and equal way to get harbucks coffee kicked out of town forever
well what do you think
wow it its great
yes it is well put it on the air immediately
what do you think hon hon whats the matter
i have a big problem with this
what do you mean
we are just using those boys for our benefit they have no idea what theyre saying
but kids are great to get people on our side
you dont just throw a child in a political commercial to sell your beliefs i wont be a part of this anymore
honey alls fair in love and war and coffee hon hu-hon
take your corporate coffee and go back to new york city

hey kids im camel joe and i love a fresh cup of coffee its yum diddly-icious and it makes you feel super i have a surprise for you the new kiddicino from harbucks more sugar and all the other goodies kids like with all the caffeine of a normal double latte
no billy no coffee for you you should be ashamed of yourself using cartoons to push caffeine on children
why dont you go back to the hole you crawled out from lady
uh mr postum im afraid youve got a lot to learn about making coffee
oh and you dont your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea
uh im sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow and if the law passes youre gonna be thrown out of town
what
at five oclock the best coffee wins either your coffee or a fresh warm cup of tweeks coffee like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age you can count on tweeks coffee to start your day
tomorrow for the prop 10 vote well set up ballot booths here all right men well throw up the stage here before the vote well get a band everyone likes like uhhhh like

oh quit being so melodramatic sanchez jesus christ
damn dude this place is huge

collecting underpants is just phase 1 phase 1 collect underpants
sooo whats phase 2
hey whats phase 2
phase 1 we collect underpants

us gnomes are geniuses at corporations
time to go to work work all nightse--
jesus christ look out
oh my god they killed kenny
you bastards listen we have to give a huge speech tomorrow about corporate takeovers
holy shit weve killed your friend
yeahyeahyeah look weve gotta know about corporate takeovers tomorrow or were screwed
christ we squished him like a bug
do you know anything about corporate takeovers
well we can explain that to you easily
yes for a price
what
you know
underpants
underpants
toto ladies and gentlemen
yeah toto whoo toto woo
all right and now before we all vote yes on prop 10 here to remind us why are the lovable innocent children
uh since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers we went and asked our friends the underpants gnomes and they told us all about big corporations
underpants gnomes
big corporations are good
what
whats this
good
because without big corporations we wouldnt have things like cars and computers and canned soup
even harbucks coffee started off as a small little business but because it made such great coffee and because they ran their business so well they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today and that is why we should all let harbucks stay
ogh
thats not what you said last time
uuuh well the truth is we didnt write that paper last time
you little turds youve ruined my life for the last time
these boys are absolutely right weve been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause and its wrong were as low and despicable as rob reiner you keep protesting and complaining but did any of you ever even bother to taste harbucks coffee harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best dont you think you should at least try it
hey this is pretty damn good
yeah it doesnt have that bland raw sewage taste that tweeks coffee has
hey hey that is good
its a french roast
its subtle and mild mild like that first splash of sun on an april morning this coffee is coffee the way it should be
hehey no hard feelings tweek you know we still need someone to run this harbucks coffeehouse im sure it will make a lot of money
thank you mr postum but i think well be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery
aggghhh
just kidding son
i love you guys
