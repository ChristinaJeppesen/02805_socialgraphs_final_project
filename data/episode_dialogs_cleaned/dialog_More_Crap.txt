why are men so obsessed with how big their crap is
guinness world records america how can i help you the biggest crap we actually dont keep track of that record sir because we dont want to look we get calls from men all the time who believe they took the biggest crap and we simply cant handle all the measuring and verification you need to call the european fecal standards and measurements office in zurich youre welcome jeez another one guinness world records america
uhh yes hello my name is randy marsh and i believe i took the worlds biggest crap
you need to call the european fecal standards and measurements office in zurich their number is listed on their web site
herr president take a look at this it is a crap sent to us from the united states
very niiice has it been checked for accuracy
it appears to be legitimate based on the photo we estimate that the crap is over eight and a half courics
wed better get on a plane right away
hm enshnusen
verron snusunarich
what was your primary diet for this poo mr marsh
uhh mostly pf changs general tsos chicken oh and uh and a lot of uh aunt jemimas frozen sausage biscuits in the morning

the standard measuring unit for human feces one katie couric is approximately two and a half pounds of excrement
the current record is a crap weighing 75 courics

but he could have faked it it isnt fair
doesnt matter hes got the record now theres nothing i can do
oh yes there is you could do it again

think about it you werent even trying to take the biggest crap last time imagine if you actually worked at it
hey hey thats right
nooo i cant go through all that again its too much
come on randy ill bet you can crap that big again easy
with the right diet and training who knows what youre capable of
guys forget it its over it was a fluke crap ill never take one that big again
is it over randy we all saw that crap you took that was no fluke theres something inside you that made you able to do it randy you have a gift now who knows why god chose you but he did and if you walk away now youll always wonder how big a crap you could have taken
i would need a lot of help
thats what were here for
come on randy what do you say
i say lets give bono a run for his money yeah yyeeaahhhh
tonight a possible attack on iran may mean the beginning of a new war in the middle east
oh no
but first the record for the worlds biggest crap will it again be broken
agh
randy marsh of colorado is now three weeks into his quest to make a new crap spending nearly every waking hour at pf changs
is this really newsworthy
you just dont understand
youre right i dont
at the same time some people are questioning bonos current record entry saying nobody has ever seen it in person bono could not be reached for comment as he is currently in africa helping the needy
hello hello
marsh is attempting to break the record again we thought you should know
he cant beat my nine and a half courics
well hes going to try
fine but he has to take the crap in front of you in zurich
bono weve never had that rule before
is the only way you can know es not cheating if he doesnt crap in zurich it shouldnt count
ultrasound is very simple mr marsh were going to use harmless waves to look inside your belly just gonna put some warm gel on your stomach first
oooooo
okay take a deep breath i see the crap now i cant say for sure but i id say is about 14 courics
fourteen
thats great randy
can i can i see it
sure this is your colon a-and here is the feces growing inside your belly
ahhh
guys we have a problem i talked to the efsm and they say randy has to take the crap in zurich
in zurich
they say that bono is demanding it and that their hands are tied
im sorry mr marsh i i cannot condone you traveling on an airplane in your condition it is never safe to fly during your turd trimester
hi could i speak with mr bono please
mr bono you have a young gentleman caller
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah get the jet ready bovis ive got to be going
hi my name is stan marsh my dads trying to beat your record for biggest crap
oh right he cant make it to zurich right
thats kind of what im here for do you really need the biggest crap record could you maybe see your way to just letting my dad have this one
let him have it why would i do that
look you you gotta understand sir my dads never won an award for anything ever he doesnt have one single trophy i mean even i have a second-place trophy for most sports illustrated subscriptions sold
i have the first-place trophy for that
dude dont you have enough i mean you got tons of money a jet and the biggest rock band in the world a hot wife and youve been knighted i mean at some point cant you just kind of fuck off
i want people to know that im worth something that i matter
all im asking is that maybe with this one thing let my dad be number 1 a-and you can still be number 2
number two number two
agh
nobody calls me that anymore and gets away with it take it back take it back
i take it back
say im not number two
youre not number two
thats right im not yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
what is wrong with that guy
your father is in grave danger come with me
it must be quite a crap
come on randy you have to push
what are you saying how do you know my dad is gonna die
because nobody has ever taken a crap that big before
so bonos newest record is a lie
look i first knew something was wrong when i looked at bonos first award for biggest crap it said he took it in 1960
so
so thats the year bono was born then it all made sense to me how could bono be so talented so caring and yet seem like such a piece of crap because he is crap dont you get it bono is not the record holder
hes the record
yes
i cant do it i cant do it
the crap is simply too big mr marsh we must perform a caesarean
but then does it still count
oh no the biggest crap means you crapped it out
i believe thats true we are sorry mr marsh but if you cannot crap out the crap its not really a crap
no nooo
there there randy you you gave it your best shot
i want my wife sharon sharon
what
im sorry sharon sorry that i let you down sorry i cant crap like bono
well congratulations bono it appears your record is intact
i had a feeling it would be
wait stop dad your old crap counts bono never took a second crap to beat yours
get him out of here
what are you talking about young man
somebodys been keeping it a secret bono was never the record holder hes the record
its not true kill the kid i want him dead
its too late bono the boy has learned the truth
herr broloff what do you know of this
its true im afraid you see until mr marsh came along i was the record holder for the biggest crap i took it back in 1960 it was the most amazing crap id ever taken
poppa no say nothing more
come to me my darling precious child after i had broken the record i took the crap home i was so proud of it that i decided to keep it to try and raise it like a child
no poppa no poppa
there there my little crap dont cry here do you want the biddy hm does bono want the biddy yes he likes the biddy doesnt he
dude
i kept the crap in my office nursed it fed it biddy and soon biddy made him strong biddy made him grow up into one of the most influential figures of our time easy bono that hurts the biddy
biddy
my little crap has accomplished many things but he could never shed the fact that he was really a number two so he spent his life trying to be number one in everything
thats why hes able to do so much try to help so many people but still seem like such a piece of shit
you have blemished this noble societys good name herr broloff
have i look at the crap i took all those years ago bono is now almost six feet tall and over 80 courics in weight no matter how you look at it he is still the record
oh god here it comes ohhh hot-hot-hot-hot hottt-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot hot hot ho-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ot
my god
it must be over a hundred courics
dad are you all right
yeah im im good feel a lot better
mr marsh we apologize and if its okay with you we would like to present you your long overdue trophy
