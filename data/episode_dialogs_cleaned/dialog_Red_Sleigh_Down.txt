ah-a-a-alright im done
youre done
ye-yes i-ive tallied up all the times youve been naughty and deducted the times youve been nice
yeah so hows it look
it doesnt look good eric it doesnt look good
but ill still be getting presents this year right
a-a-aactually it looks like this year youre gonna owe santa three hundred and six presents
what
four thousand three hundred and twelve instances of being naughty against three deductions of being nice is is bad
three you didnt deduct all my nice invoices look look what about this one
yes wa-a-i didnt think "hitting clyde in the balls with slingshot" really counted as nice
it was nice for tolkien he laughed for like 20 minutes
ye you cant deduct things like that eric santa will know and then hell come after you
god-damnit i have to get that haibo robot doll you sonofabitch
hey hey im just your naughty-and-nice accountant dont blame me for the numbers
havent you seen the haibo doll its like a pet a robot pet you have to feed it and pet it or else it dies and its the coolest thing ever santa has to bring me one
but what look arent there any other nice things youve done recently we can write off here
uh oh i brushed my teeth last night
eh brushing your teeth isnt naughty or nice eric it just it falls more into the category of brushing your teeth
well theres still time before christmas cant i still make up for it
if you cured cancer and aids next week you would still owe two presents
jesus christ
ah im afraid youre gonna have to find a way to do the nicest greaatest thing anyone has ever done ever
