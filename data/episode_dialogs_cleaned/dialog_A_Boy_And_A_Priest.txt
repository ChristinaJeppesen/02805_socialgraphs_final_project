but they just dont understand you like i do
stop defending me there are things you dont know

yes it is it is my fault
why
because i knew all right i knew years ago when bad things started coming out about the catholic church i went to the vatican and i found out that the problem was worse than anyone even thought i thought i could help fix it so i kept my mouth shut i thought there was cancer in the church that we could get rid of but the church is cancer its not about a few bad apples there are only a few good apples and im clearly not one of them so just stay away from me
but i thought we were pals
you thought wrong
hey hey there whats the matter my child did you know that jesus loves you
sometimes i wonder
"and the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me" want a three musketeers

should i bring out the kumby
no this is gonna be a bigger job than that bring out the kumboni
hey randy whats up
stephen stephen listen the boys are missing fr maxi thinks theyve been taken by the other priests
taken by priests should we call the police or buy some condoms
okay okay-okay that was good but seriously we have to find these guys the boys are in danger

well yeah we got a really weird text from him saying not to worry he needed to do some camping
oh my lord i know where to go and when we get there ill need to go in alone
yeah ill bet
hes not showing up
try the priest call
i love jeeesus i love jeeesus
i dont think hes coming
oh hes coming all right just not here lets start packing up you get on the kumboni and eradicate this place along with everything in it
yes your holiness
wait
father
you wanted to find me well here i am i know why youre here the church cant have someone like me going around making it look bad so go ahead do it just get it over with
what no
you think we searched all over town and set up this trap to kill you were catholics were here to give you what you deserve a full transfer to the beautiful maldive islands luxury airfare and beach house included
a transfer
the church took care of everything just like it always has from the beginning "thank you for cleaning up all my cum"
i can just go i can start over in the maldives
no one will make fun of you there they cant even speak english and dont worry therell be plenty of priests to take your place here look i know its a big change but you know what you have to do
yes i do i dont think i have any other choice
no he cant
well our work here is done praise be to christ guys it certainly was a tough one but i think we got everything cleaned up and- aaaaugh
the kumboni aaah aaaaagh aah
aaaaugh aaaaugh
no no no no no no no no
father you did it
im so sorry my child i never meant to say we werent pals
does that mean youre gonna stay
of course now i have purpose and i have meaning my job here is to protect you all of you
the lord be with you
and with your spirit
today id like to talk on the subject of penance the penitent have deep remorse but for true penance we must be humble enough to admit that the lords forgiveness is undeserved
kind of like how getting raped by a catholic priest is undeserved
in job 426 we read "therefore i reprehend myself and do penance in dust and ashes"
and in choir boys butts and asses
so we are not to punish ourselves but instead we are to make ourselves passionate
like a catholic priest at a chuck e cheese
oh god its good to have my faith back
passionate to understand all that christ sacrificed and how hard it truly was
how hard what truly was
