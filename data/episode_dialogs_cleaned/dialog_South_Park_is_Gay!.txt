so im watching the season premiere of boy meets boy on television and then queer eye for the straight guy comes on right so i fall asleep in front of the tv and when i wake up i see that ive spilled the coke i was drinking all over my satin pajama top
oh my gosh are you serious that was the cutest top ever
i know
(i just love this jacket cause its sooo beautiful)
oh tell me about it ken doll
hey dudes
what a dork

yeah that jacket is so september 10th
oohh my god you got splotches on your neck are you using any exfoliating products at all
we cant let kyle out in public like this you guys
(thats the truth)

you came into my life and my world never looked so bright yeahits true you bring out the best in mewhen you are around when you are around all things just keep getting betterit keeps getting better life keeps getting better and better (all things just keep getting better)
coming up on hbc its queer eye for the straight guy
we have got to get you some tighter-fitting shirts
then its boy meets boy followed by will and grace and then the love boat with men
my goodness there certainly are a lot of gay shows on television these days

oh hello mr garrison
chef can i talk to you
sure come on in
thanks come slave oh its just awful chef i used to feel like an outsider a totally different person who stood out in this town now every straight guy is acting gayer than me
oh jesus jesus christ
well what do you want me to do about it
chef what did you do when white people stole your culture
oh well we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them
how did you do that
well like with our slang black people always used to say "im in the house" instead of "im here" but then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse" hizzouse became hizzizzouse and then white folk started saying that and we had to change it to hizzie then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle" and now because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle" we have to say "flippity floppity floop"
we dont have time for all that chef oh if only those queer eye for the straight guy people understood what they were doing wait thats it i know exactly what to do come on mr slave lets get back to our flippity floppity floop
oh no damnit dont call it that

oh no they ruined my life i get to kill them first
they took gay culture from real gays and their asses are ours

we shouldnt be fighting amongst ourselves we should be uniting against metrophobes like these
this is crazy
crazy different outcasts call us what you want but us metros are real people just like you
you can metrobash us all you want but were here to stay
yeah mom were proud of who we are
thats right proud you know what i think guys i think we should have a metrosexual pride parade
great idea eric raise metrosexual awareness
we can make floats and decorate them with streamers and flowers
(woohoohoo)
come on fellas out of the malls and into the streets
out of the malls and into the streets out of the malls and into the streets out of the malls and into the streets
what the hell did that show do to them
you sure you dont want to press charges
thats okay officer i think they learned murder is wrong
especially in those pants
look guys were sorry we tried to murder you but you have to stop what youre doing
are you crazy were the hottest thing on tv
but dont you see the price youre selling out your own kind look us gays have created a lifestyle a a culture that is uniquely ours if we keep trying to make straight people into us well were gonna have no identity left
sorry charlie no sale
buh but this doesnt make sense how can gay men do this to their own people unless youre not gay at all
you just had to push it didnt you
just had to keep asking question
now you know the truth
they arent gay then what are they
for a thousand years our kind have lived beneath the earths crust banished by man in the kindling wars
oh my god
we are the crab people
aaaaaaaaaaaah
jesus christ
crab people crab people crab people
crab people crab people crab people
see now where we have been forced to live for a thousand years but soon we shall rule the land above and mankind will be gone
gone
crab people are too small and weak to take over man by force and so we came up with our perfect plan
if you cant beat man change man
i knew it i knew gay people would never do this to their own kind
when all the world is metrosexual the crab people shall finally reign supreme
crab people crab people
taste like crab talk like people
crab people
youll never turn me into a metrosexual i like being a dirty filthy little boy
very well if we cant make you into metrosexuals then we will make you into crab people take them
all things just keep getting betteryou came into my life(crab people)and my world never looked so bright yeah(crab people)its true you bring out the best in me(crab people)when you are around when you are around(crab people)all things just keep getting better(crab people)
