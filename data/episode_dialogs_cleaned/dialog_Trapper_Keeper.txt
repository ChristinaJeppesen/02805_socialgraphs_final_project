okay children lets take our seats my name is mr garrison and im the new kindergarten teacher i used to be the third grade teacher but i had a little "nervous breakdown" and went into the mountains where i lived off of "rat carcasses" but im all better now and the school was nice enough to let me go on teaching as long as it was for kindergarten but its not a demotion no i mean just because a teacher was teaching third grade and now is teaching kindergarten thats not a demotion is it no thats right its not well lets start with roll call uh lets see filmore anderson

broflovski i had your older brother kyle in my third-grade class hes a very smart kid im sure you are too well thats bad news for everybody else because i will be grading you all on a curve

hybrid with wellington bear calculator
ready for hybrid
and now it can use wellington bear calculator too
wow

hey
gaagghhh
whoa dude
ahh try to take my trapper keeper will you
please you do not understand
book him barbrady another job well done
that trapper keeper has to be destroyed
why are you so obsessed with cartmans trapper keeper bill cosby
bill cosby
nooo listen to me i am not really bill cosby my name is bsm-471 i am a cyborg engineered by humans from the year 2034
well i knew you werent bill cosby
i have come to destroy that trapper keeper because it was the dawsons creek trapper keeper that belongs to an eric cartman in south park which three years from now manifests itself into an omnipotent super being and destroys all of humanity in the year 2004 a hybrid-assimilating computer linked with a satellite uplink computer from there it was able to slowly take over every computer in the world it became stronger and stronger until by the year 2018 it broke away from mankind and there was nothing the humans could do it wasnt long before mighty trapper keeper started to destroy everything it saw as useless including humans the nations tried everything to stop it nuclear devices seismic missiles but nothing worked the humans built robots of their own whole armies of them but nothing was strong enough to stop trapper keeper and so finally the humans decided to send one of their robots into the past to destroy the trapper keeper before it even got started
wow thats amazing
man i guess sometimes we let our technology and stuff grow too fast
what do you think officer barbrady
huh oh im sorry i wasnt listening
and so eric now you see why we must destroy your trapper keeper
you guys did i mention that it has a pencil sharpener and a crayon sharpener
cartman it takes over the world and destroy all of humanity
what would you guys have me do huh walk around with just a plain old trapper keeper like kyles is that what you want
yes
aw damnit here take it you want my heart as well youll find it on the bottom of your shoes
i decided
oh thank god flora alright who do you vote for
umm ike
yay
okay so then the total is six for filmore and now seven votes for ike ike is the new class president
we want a recount
what
recount recount recount recount
oh of all the juvenile things ive ever heard you lost filmore dont be such a baby alright alright ill count up the ballots again okay we had one vote for filmore and this time i again get six votes for filmore and seven votes for ike
count them again
yeah
no children ive recounted 106 times now and i keep coming up with seven to six except in the one instance where it came out seven to five and one where it came out twelve to fourteen its over ike is class president
wait theres still that absent kid
yeah if carlos is absent we have to wait for his vote
oh will you grow up
absent kids count absent kids count absent kids count
jesus alright well wait for tomorrow so the absent kid can cast his vote now go home
good morning humans
hey bill cosby
i have successfully destroyed eric cartmans trapper keeper i broke it apart dipped the motherboards in acid burned the memory chips and sent the wiring to the four corners of canada
that should do it
so what are you going to do with your crappy robot life now bill cosby
well that is a problem that is causing me some disconcernment i am still here but i shouldnt be here if trapper keeper has been stopped then i should not exist but here i am something is still not right
hey dudes
cartman you still got a trapper keeper
yeah im a genius last night i went home and told my mom that i lost the last one then i cried and i cried and finally she felt so bad that she took me to the store and bought me a new one so everything worked out
oh no
cartman you dumbass you cant get a new one
why the hell not
because if your trapper keeper takes over the world then maybe it was this trapper keeper and not the one before
wait so then you guys burned my last one for no reason
we will have to destroy this trapper keeper
but i dont think i can get my mom to buy me another one
dont you get it you cant have any trapper keepers fat ass
oh that is bullcrap and you know what i think i think this whole thing is a setup thats right kyle got this guy to say that hes a robot from the future just because hes jealous of my trapper keeper and you know what else screw you guys im going home
cartman
ech screw you guys home
well that does it
hey what are you doing
im afraid i have no other choice for the sake of humanity i have to kill him
oh okay
yeah thats fine no wait
what
can i do it
oh well i suppose
sweet kiss your ass goodbye fat boy
wait perhaps there is another way if you could take me to where eric cartman lives i could try reasoning with his human mother
well yeah or we could just kill him
yeah thatd be faster
hes right there
im afraid i cant i think im actually starting to feel what you humons call "compassion" it is an amazing feeling
awww
alright children as you know weve been waiting for the absent kids ballot to come in well his mother was nice enough to bring him in from the hospital so that he could cast his vote ms harris thank you very much billy dont forget to pick up your lung alright the absent kids ballot is for filmore
yay/hooray
wait one minute
oh jesus tap-dancing christ
i think the ballot were misleading some kids didnt understand whom they were voting for
theres a box next to filmores name and a box next to ikes whats not to understand
youre just saying that cause you know youre gonna lose now
no im saying that because you are a boogerface
well just you wait cause my famous aunt is on huh way right now
whos your famous aunt
my aunt rosie rosie odonnell

trapper keeper ready to ensorb
oh cool
trapper keeper merging
whoa
and so you see ms cartman you cannot buy your son eric another trapper keeper not now not ever
right because it will hybrid with all those other processors and generate a whole new era of technological darkness
correct
well i certainly wont buy him anymore then bill
good now all that is left to do is destroy the trapper keeper eric has now where is he
in his room but why dont i show you the rest of the house first
uh-oh
here we go again
come this way billy
well come on lets go upstairs and get cartmans trapper keeper ourselves
kyle is just jealous of you trapper keeper you kick assi dont wanna let my trapper keeper get--
open up cartman were taking your trapper keeper
screw you guys screw you guysscrew you guys scr--
trapper keeper ready to ensorb
huh

agggghhh
oh yeah oh yeah
what the hell is that oh my god what is that thing children theres some huge bulbous monstrosity heading for the classroom oh my god its awful its coming for the door
hello kids
aunt rosie
run for your lives children ill try to fight it off
thats my aunt rosie odonnell
oh oh um pleasure to meet you miss donnell youre looking well
dont worry kids everythings gonna be fine whats the problem
aunt rosie we think i won class president
no ike won
look its very simple we took a vote and the vote tied so now we gotta come up with a way--
well it obviously isnt that simple is it i mean youd think a little kindergarten teacher couldve handled this but now were gonna do it my way
we are trapper keeper
oh no it is heading for cheyenne mountain
why is that bad
it was when the trapper keeper assimilated with the supercomputer at cheyenne mountain that it was able to fuse into all defensive computers
then we have to stop it before it gets there
step on it bill cosby
hey mark look
wow that is about the nicest trapper keeper ive ever seen
cartman you have to stop
we are trapper keeper we are one
a part of your friend must still be alive in there
he is in there
that must be what trapper keeper is using for ventilation if one of you could get in there you could reach the cpu
one-two-three not it
not-- aw damnit
cartman
im going to try and break you away from the computer cartman i need to remove the cpu
im afraid i cant let you do that kyle
screw you fat ass
hey screw you
cartman
agh--
no
okay so then what were going to do is count everybodys vote by hand and after that were gonna go over the votes again manually and then--
oh stop it stop it stop i-i-it look kids were all in this kindergarten class together we have to respect one another or else were in for a terrible school year
were just making sure that the kids that voted for my nephew dont get cheated
half the kids in the class didnt vote for your nephew so what about them you dont give a crap about them because theyre not on your side people like you preach tolerance and open-mindedness all the time but when it comes to middle america you think were all evil and stupid country yokels who need your political enlightenment well just because youre on tv doesnt mean you know crap about the government now get your ass back on first class and respect this classs right to make up their own minds oh sorry i got a little off the subject there kids
how dare you i will not be preached at by a country bumpkin im leaving this podunk town but in my place im gonna send more lawyers statesmen and press than you have ever seen
oh no children i think ive just made this a whole lot worse
aaghh
wagghh
well that does it im gonna have to report this car one to base-- aghh
it is infusing with everything it is already too powerful to stop
kyles got to succeed hes just got to
i cant reach the cpu
what are you doin get out of my way
oh no now theres two of those things
no i think that other thing is rosie odonnell
huh which one i-its just like im seeing double
i said get out of my way aaaaggghhhh ogh noo--
eeww
look i think that infusing with rosie odonnell has made trapper keeper sick
oohh bad pie bad pie
this is your chance kyle cartman has weakened
got em
he did it
okay children the lawyers for ikes side have agreed with the lawyers on filmores side to hold another meeting regarding form 22f do we all have that form
is this the kindergarten classroom
jesse jackson
thats right i believe the african-american in your class were misrepresented
we dont have any african-americans in our class
oh bye
alright so apparently what were gonna do now is hand-count each persons ballot--
mistoreh garrison i concede
you yuh you what
i dont wanna play anymore cause this game is stupid
yeah it doesnt make any sense
ike you could be class president
i pooped my pants
can we fingerpaint now
fingerpaint fingerpaint
ohuh yes yes lets fingerpaint
you did it kyle kyle saved your life fat ass
look im fading it must have worked i dont exist
huh thats a bitch
oh well i guess everythings fine now so lets go home
hey whoa whoa whoa cartman all youve been doing is making fun of kyle and now hes saved your life you at least owe him a thank you
awww man
cartman
alright alright kyle
