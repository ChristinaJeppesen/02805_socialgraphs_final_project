so these guys made fun of your weight and made you feel ashamed
yes i was just trying to do my job as a food critic and they all ganged up on me and said i was fat
alright why dont you take me back to what happened
i was in the locker room i was in my underwear and these kids walked by then i looked in the mirror and i thought i looked kind of ripped and so i asked one of the kids if he would take a picture of me and he did and i looked at the picture and i looked pretty ripped so later at home i put the picture up on my yelp account and i typed in "dont i look ripped" and i thought people would be stoked on me then this morning i saw the comments on twitter and some people called me names and said i wasnt ripped and they said that i was fat and i didnt have muscles the internet made fun of me and
well eric maybe you shouldnt have put a picture of you in your underwear up on social media
hey you got a fuckin problem mackey

morning kyle have a seat right there you probably heard that eric here has been dealing with some body shaming
uh huh
well eric and i have been talking and weve decided its probably best for him to get off of social media
yeah probably
so what were looking for is a student volunteer somebody who can put the things eric wants up on the internet for him and also filter through all the comments and make it more of a safe space for him
wait what
i said you were perfect because youre really good at getting all your schoolwork done on time so youd probably do a really good job
you want me to run cartmans twitter and yelp account and only give him the good comments
thats right
no
kyle you know what body-shaming is right how much it can hurt someones life all you have to do is check out all the comments type out just the positive ones and give that to eric on paper
if he doesnt like what people say on twitter he can get off
okay kyle well maybe youd like two weeks detention instead
give me give me detention
you sure about that
yeah ill take the detention
thats two weeks detention for you bud ill see you at 4 and when we said someone should probably help eric by filtering out any negative comments he mentioned you by name
is this a joke
im not a joke
nothing funny about this testaburger this is a big problem in our country
im not doing it
and thats two weeks detention for you congratulations so any comments that seem inappropriate or hurtful in any way you need to delete and not include in your daily report to eric
i wanted someone smart and hard-working

okay nice oh ni- oh very enthusiastic this is so great oh kyle you thought me having someone edit my social media would make me look stupid you should see all the comments im getting people are actually really stoked on me now
its a pretty brutal job sifting through all that darkness
alright everyone listen up in order to better understand the negative effects of body-shaming we have a- hey leslie put a fuckin sock in it we have a guest speaker today who will challenge our perceptions of physical beauty so please welcome action star and hero steven seagal
youve got a problem with me im your worse nightmare i have no fear of death more important i dont fear life im a big action movie star and people are pretty stoked on me and then i put a picture of myself up on the internet and i had my shirt off and i said "do you think im ripped" and some people commented saying i didnt look ripped that i was fat and they called me steven se-boom-boom so i put another picture on the internet and i thought people would be stoked on me but they said that i looked like a fat turd and they said i wasnt buff body-shaming isnt cool and if p-people shame you on the inter n-net you have to make sure that you stay you stay strong and tell everyone youre proud of how you look like this
hey seagal listen that was a really amazing talk you gave to the kids
thank you
i can see that youre in a lot of pain bro ive got someone who i think can help
so i want you to do for mr seagal the same thing that youre doing for eric cartman
but pc principal i really dont have time
this man took the time to come to your school and help spread body-shaming awareness i think you can give him a little of your time
yes sir

yes
okay looks like your total comes to $3798 would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids
yes i would like to give a dollar

yech oh god thats terrible jesus
yeah no im telling you tracy its the greatest thing ever im getting all my twitter and instagram comments on paper and the nasty mean stuff all gets edited out
whoa my god wugh
yeah and the coolest thing ever since i started using this service all of my followers are actually way more stoked on me so cool right
butters
yeah
what the hell is this the last report you gave me has a comment that says "this picture of you burned my eyes fatso"
well im sorry eric i i guess it slipped through the cracks im overloaded with all the new people
what new people
well ive got demi lovato to take care of now and lena dunham just put a picture of her asshole on twitter and wants only the positive comments
dude fuck demi lovato shes fuckin hot shes not being fat-shamed
am so but i dont care people just have to accept my body the way it is
butters i want this fixed by tonight you got that
okay eric
this is a place where hope is scarce these people are hungry little jojo here might not eat today but does that mean its okay for cashiers to ask us for money while were in the checkout line it isnt right and it isnt fair just $2 a day adds up to 62 goddamned dollars a month if you go to whole foods as much as i do nobody should have to feel the shame the humiliation of being asked to add money onto their grocery bill help now lets make grocery stores a #safespace for all together we can make a difference
because charity-shaming hurts everyone
you know if theres one thing i really respect its plus-sized models who challenge the idea of what makes a woman beautiful these ladies are gonna be part of a big ad campaign for plus-sized lingerie and we wanna make sure theyre protected from any harassing comments
do i have to sir
hey theyre gonna putting themselves out there and all im asking you to do is go through their social media and delete the two or three comments that are mean
pc principal ah i dont think you quite realize how much negative stuff i have to sift through
i know its a lot but i just really need you to help these plus-sized models and vin diesel
vin diesel too

thats great this little piggy went to marketthis little piggy stayed home this little piggy was in fast and the furious and this little piggy goes direct to cable and this little piggy just bought fifty-three dollars in beer and frozen pizzas would you like to make a dollar donation to hungry kids today
look around you what do you see people who are slim skinny but not everyone can have nice bodies like them just imagine it putting your pictures up on twitter just to have some people write comments about your weight it happens all too often
