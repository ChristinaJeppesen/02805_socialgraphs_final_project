the south loses this battle cartman they lose the war
nuh uhn the south is gonna win
no theyre not stupid
yes we are
how much do you wanna bet
now remember everybody for a good reenactment weve got to pretend down to the last detail that were really in the civil war so when the north wins all of us on the confederate side should act all bummed and depressed
come on cartman how much do you wanna bet the south doesnt win
well this war is about slavery so how about if the south wins you two assholes have to be my slaves for a month
and if the north wins youre our slave for a month
right
youre on
then i shall bid you good morning gentlemen and see you on the battlefield
hoohoo what a dumbass
yeah he doesnt even know that the south loses the civil war
its gonna be rad having cartman be our slave
and with that lets all go to tamarack hill and put on a good show
yes woohoo yea
welcome to the south park reenactment of the battle of tamarack hill the men in gray are the confederacy from the south in blue are the union from the north
it was a cold morning in 1862 the union army had to get the bell of appomattox down from tamarack hill what ensued was a bloody battle but after many hours the union army prevailed here now is the reenactment of that great battle
forward
lets bring those confederate bastards down
fire

yeh-hah
oh so this is what it was like
hey whats that guy doing
yippie long live the confederacy
huh wha-
what the hell
he took the bell
he cant do that
the confederacy doesnt take the bell
hooray for the south
cartman you cant do that
god dammit now we have to start over
alrighty everyone were going to do the entire reenactment again because of some confusion over the bell now i know youre just trying to help eric but we have to let the union capture the bell this time
but why why should they get the bell
wuh well cause were supposed to lose
but we dont have to lose
what
gentlemen we can win this battle sure we could lose and tonight we can go back to our families and say "we did it we lost like we were supposed to arent we proud" or or we take that hill we take that hill and when we stand tall upon it we hold our heads high and we yell "not this year this year belongs to the confederaseh"
by god hes right
