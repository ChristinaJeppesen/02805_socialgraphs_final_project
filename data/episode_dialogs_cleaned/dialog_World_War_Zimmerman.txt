no the plane crashed were in the colorado mountains somewhere matt matt my husband he said the outbreak was all over the news but everything was totally fine where he was
totally fine then it hasnt happened yet oh my god we still have time
help help me please i have two little girls in chicago please find them
its okay we have reason to believe it hasnt spread yet
then you have to stop it
yes
and there must be a patient zero the person it all starts from
his name is tolkien
we have to kill him before he infects everyone else
i wont do it he used to be my friend
you have to you have to be strong if you can stop this- if you can save the world- then you have to do it promise me promise me
alright i promise i wont let the black people riot and destroy the world
thank you-wait what
oh my god oh my god
were gonna live through this do you hear me
yes
come on
first a wave of 911 calls about a virus and now a plane has apparently gone down in the colorado rocky mountains is this the beginning of the end
oh boy zombie apocalypse
the government is looking for a patient zero going only off of this sketch which was found in a notebook at the airport anyone with information regarding patient zero is asked to contact the authorities immediately
holy moly
can i help you
stay by the window tell me if anything changes i need something that can shoot with complete accuracy from a distance
alright you want a rifle well like this 22 caliber what is it you intend to shoot
a person
you mean a person whos threatening you
threatening all of us
please please hurry its important
well you should be fine so long as the person breaks into your house and is an immediate threat to you
what how am i supposed to get a person to break into my house
you cant shoot someone who threatens you just out on the street well unless of course youre in a state that has a "stand your ground" law
stand my ground
please were running out of time
see now with a "stand your ground" law you could legally shoot somebody thats threatening you whether theyre in your house or not
yes yes thats what i need ill take that
no no see youve gotta be in a state with a "stand your ground" law like florida
this is hopeless how am i supposed to shoot tolkien with all these stupid rules wait a minute i cant shoot tolkien but i can shoot anyone i want in florida
so long as theyre threatening you
what what is it please hurry my husband might still be alive
the other way to stop the outbreak tolkien isnt the only patient zero the outbreak wont happen if we shoot george zimmerman we have to get to florida
lets go lets go lets move move move move lets go find the closest airport in florida
this plane is going to baltimore
if we dont get to florida theres not going to be a baltimore left black guy in the back alight now lets find zimmerman
put this on we have to stay hidden from here out
what are we going to do
im going to flush out patient zero and youre gonna shoot him its the only way
what if he attacks us first
dont worry nobody can see us wearing black
i havent had the time to thank you for doing what youve d-
eat your breakfast girls
wheres daddy
you can eat without your father in the room now hurry
daddy
good morning girls save daddy any pancakes look at that six am and my family is already smiling
how did i get such a perfect husband george zimmerman
and how did i get such a beautiful wife
i love you dad
i love you too princess i love both of you equally
nothing can ever go wrong so long as we all have each other
is there any hope for stopping the zombie apocalypse cnn has just received word that the government has learned the identity of patient zero the nine year old threat to humanity has been tracked down and measures are being taken to stop him
daddy whats a patient zero
hello mr zimmerman your country needs you
what do you need from me
we need you to shoot a young african-american for us
i gave that up
youre the best zimmerman we just need you to do it one more time for the security of the world
damnit i have a wife and kids now
then do it for your family this is about protecting people zimmerman keeping our streets safe so that our children are free to go out
somethings wrong look out
my god i didnt even see him
nice work zimmerman
are you guys okay
what was that daddy
more needless violence
nonsense you did what you had to youre a hero
that may be true but ill have to live with this the rest of my life even though ill be walking around a free man
hey wait a minute this kid isnt black hes white
wait what
guilty
the zombie apocalypse is over all the panic crashing planes and chaos appear to have for some reason died with george zimmerman and as for the little boy who was so mercilessly gunned down although he survived the shooting his wishes are to remain anonymous giving the hospital only the nickname "brad pitt" but cooler
that sure wasnt much of a zombie apocalypse
yeah that sucked
well at least ill bet tolkiens glad its over with arent you tolkien
hey tolkien sup bro hows it goin dude i know how it feels now
