hehe hehe that was sweet you guys
first there was planking people taking pictures of themselves in a planked position and putting the photos on the internet planking was soon replaced by owling and after the super bowl by bradying but the newest meme involves pulling the shirt out to look like boobs its called faith hilling and all around the world people are doing it kids adults and even notable celebrities are getting into the act but as faith hilling is more and more popular the question on everyones mind who will be the first to die doing it
i have been sent here because you children are playing with fire faith hilling is nothing more than an evolution of bradying from football quarterback to football singer
oh please bradying is so 2000 and late
i know you all think what youre doing is new and hip and cool but the truth is memeing has been around a long time were gonna watch a film strip now thats a little dated but i think it gets the point across
for many young people today taking pictures in silly poses becomes a dangerous past time the latest meme has also become the most deadly its called tebowing
this is ryan and barkley theyre about to learn how dangerous tebowing can be
here is a good place ill do it right here
i dont know ryan you sure this is a good idea
stop being a scaredy-cat it will just take a second how could i get hurt
okay hold still whats that
a traaain aaaaaa
ryan
no no nooo
aaaa
aaaano no no no noooo
aaaa
aaaa
ryan
learn from me
this sure is a nice car tommy would you like to get a picture of me tebowing in it
sure what is that
oh my god its coming
god no aahh no no
tommy d-did you get the picture
oh no wait hold on
hurry hurry
aaaaa
aaaaa aaah
aaaa
be careful up there pete
just go on and take the picture
aaaa
these youths paid with their lives for tebowing when they posed for pictures they should have remembered there are only three approved memes peace signs bunny ears and fake wiener maybe you think this doesnt apply to you maybe you think your memes are safe or maybe youre watching this in the future and tebowing has been replaced by some other meme well if you are watching his in the future get off your flying cellphone scooters and think just remember--
use the approved poses if you want to be a memer peace signs bunny ears fake wiener
oh god that was boring
(totally)
so what do you want to do now
well there is the nice french café downtown maybe we should get some faith hilling pictures there
oh thats a good idea
what you mean you guys still plan on faith hilling after what we just saw
butters faith hilling defines our generation
well count me out
youre gonna give up on faith hilling just like that butters how could you
well im scared
hey did you see todays newspaper

what let me see that
how can that be already
public reaction was the stunt pulled off by five elementary school students was not only dangerous and disruptive but also completely passé
how can we be passé were only in 4th grade
"faith hilling is pretty stale" said republican candidate newt gingrich "if they had crashed the debate by taylor swifting that would have been impressive"
taylor swifting what the fuck is that

yesterday afternoon four kids went to the hospital for injuries resulting from memeing in front of a local cafe faith hilling taylor swifting these are things that will get you killed thats a loaded 38 how many of you think its a smart idea to put a loaded 38 on a 9-year-olds desk well if safety doesnt matter to you go ahead pick the gun up
oh thats okay i think
pick the gun up you might as well swifting and hilling is like playing with a loaded gun do you all understand my point

professor lamont we need to talk
i will be right back
youre an expert on memes professor lamont
yes what is this about
we need your expertise sir
have you ever heard of another species memeing on the internet
another species what are you talking about
we were hoping perhaps you could help us understand this cats have started to put pictures of themselves on the internet with bread around their heads cat breading its called its just such an odd thing to do we thought would you explain it to us
theyre evolving cats are evolving
sorry
there are two ways a species evolves physically from genes and culturally from memes just like genes memes replicate mutate and adapt
were having a hard time following you here
look in the 70s there was fonzing which replaced the outdated mustaching in the 60s cultural ideas were passed on by everybody poodle-fisting but even that evolved from people ass wedging in the 40s even before photographs humans memed for portraits all the way back to the egyptians who had pictures painted of themselves donkey ticking
you are saying cats are showing signs of evolution with their cat breading meme
if theyre putting slices of bread on their heads and taking pictures theyre proving to be almost as intelligent as we are
mr kitty do you mind explaining this you wanna tell me why youre putting pictures of yourself on the internet with bread around your face this is a bad kitty bad youre taking the idea of faith hilling and making it stupid bad kitty bad mr kitty bad kitty no more memeing come on guys bad mr kitty
well im glad we took care of that
yeah what do you guys wanna do now

(hey just accept faith hilling is out of style)
hey faith hilling is not out of style alright
(well and i cant take any of that)
no no no these stupid fads are only that okay we cant give in to this crap
dont give up on faith hilling kenny dont you give up on her

with the inevitable species war looming our countrys brightest leaders have come together to debate and reason with the ambassador of cats its called putty-whistling and the question on everyones mind who will be the first person to die from it
