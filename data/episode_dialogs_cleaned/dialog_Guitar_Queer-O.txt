thatd be awesome
so were in business then

oh yes all the biggest stars in colorado are here

you rock
all right nice rehearsal boys
d-ude i totally miffed that middle part did you see that
yeah dude thats almost impossible
that was real cool kids hey kyle theres a different controller in my car that might work better for you why dont you go with jim and hell help you find it
oh okay cool
youve got real potential kid i have no doubt you can break a million
really thatd be sweet
i think you could but uh as for your friend well to be honest i think hes holding you back
what you mean kyle
look you score a lot higher than him theres no question who the better one is i wanna put you with some other players find a partner for you who can really help you max your score
but kyle and i always play together we both chipped in for the game system
very honorable but you know where loyalty gets you in a game like guitar hero nowhere just listen to that video crowd i havent heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time youve got a chance to score a million points and i hate to see you throw it away because youre worried about your friends feelings
youre gonna love this kid stan hes one of the best guitar hero players ive ever seen except for you of course ah thad stan marsh this is thad jarvis
sup
that here has backed up a lot of really great guitar hero players isnt that right thad
yup
he doesnt even need a game system to play on he can play guitar hero acoustically
yeah but can he play buckethead on expert level
go ahead thad show him what you can do check this out pretty damn good huh

i guess i didnt realize it was just about the points
dude this game rules
lets just do this all right
hey youre the kid i sold the guitar hero game to how are you likin it
its okay i guess but i need some game guides for it my manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where im supposed to break a million in front of everybody and im im stressing out
yeah guitar hero can be pretty stressful but you know maybe instead of a game guide you should just buy another game to kind of ease the stress
huh
have you ever heard of heroin hero
hero-heroin hero
its a way easier game all you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin you could call it the ultimate first-person shooter
and theres no score no crowds
no man all you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon but you dont ever catch the dragon you just keep chasing it
chase me come on this way shoot up and then you can catch me come on
dude this is awesome
how are they coming
