so then the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick and it goes right in the other guys mouth
hey stan i have a note for you
a note
yeah uh wendy said to give you this im like a mailman
whats it say
we need to talk
ohhhhhhhh when a chick says "we need to talk" you might as well just start punching yourself in the balls dude
are you sure he has a problem wendy
yes ive read all about it its a real disease its called "hoarding" people who cant throw anything away and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just cant take it anymore
is something wrong wendy
stan we need to talk about your locker
my locker
every time i see the condition its in i j-i just wanna cry it just keeps getting messier and messier i think you have a problem
are you serious
its so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything and lately youve been asking to keep things in my locker
well its just a little messy
no stan its called "hoarding" and if you dont get help i dont know how much longer i could be with you
aw come on
then can we throw some stuff in your locker away
yeah alright
okay ive hired some experts to help you with this well make this as easy as possible on you stan
hello everyone my name is dr chinstrap im a hoarding specialist and today were gonna help stan clean out his locker alright lets go ahead and see inside your locker stan
what come on its not that bad
now as part of stans therapy we need to make sure we dont throw away anything he doesnt want us to stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out
my psychosis look it isnt that big a deal ill just throw this stuff away
okay great how about we start with this
well no thats my pencil box i need my pencil box
okay okay well put that right here on the floor now how about this broken toothbrush
well its good to have that because sometimes i really wanna brush after lunch and i-
but its broken
yeah but it works perfectly fine and i-
okay okay broken toothbrush is going right here by the pencil box now how about this old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots
eeeeewwww
well that i mean yeah i mean i kinda need that lets lets just keep that
its full of maggots stan can we throw it away
well i might need it if i every have to you know like-
the maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist stan can we throw this away
well i- i guess so but- whoa-whoa-wait this is all happening a little fast can we just slow down
now how about this empty aspirin bottle
well no dont throw that out
can we throw out these wadded up papers then
no because there could be something written on one of them thats important and uh- no dont take my empty bottle- g-give me back my sandwich
dude whats wrong with you
i dont i dont know
maybe you should go talk to the counselor
stan as your counselor im here to help you with whatever problems you might have mkay now what is the matter
well my friends are worried that im showing signs of "hoarding"
hoarding mkay whats that
well apparently its when you dont throw anything away and soon you find yourself living with a bunch of junk
hmmm i havent heard of that but it- it definitely sounds bad mkay
mr mackey is there maybe anything you wanna talk about
me like like what
well like youve got an old milk carton here from a month ago thats like-
dont you touch that thats not something to throw away if you throw that away i will rape you in the mouth mkay i will rape you in your fucking mouth mkay
theres no doubt about it the school counselor here is a class-5 hoarder as for your son mr and mrs marsh hes easily a class-3
but why is mr mackey doing this now
yes our son has always been fairly clean
we dont know a lot about what causes hoarding but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma if its okay with you wed like to run some tests on the both of them
is that really necessary for stan its just his locker
i dont know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is it can lead to room hoarding then house hoarding in some cases people even hoard animals like cats
oh yeah like that weird guy over on on burgess road that guy mr yelman hes been hoarding animals for years now
oh no really
mr yelman we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep
well i that is i i-
its okay mr yelman im a hoarding specialist what you have is an illness
dont worry mr and mrs marsh dr chinstrap is a professional at memory regression this should prove very helpful
alright everyone we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together nothing to be ashamed of everyone here has the same problem whether its office hoarding or in the locker or even the hoarding of animals
excuse me but uh i am a sheep herder
its pronounced "hoarder" and yes you are
but but i uh im actually herding sheep
yes you are hurting sheep by hoarding them arent you its good you realize that
no but i just thought that-
now listen theres a psychological reason youre all doing this and were gonna get to the bottom of it were gonna do some regression therapy ill be taking you deep into your memories into your past
mkay that that sounds like it could be bad uh-kay
trust me i know what im doing i want the three of you to relax and think about a cloud a lone cloud floating changing light cool air blowing on the cloud float- waah haaa haaa
what what jesus what
oh my god
sorry i just got a weird gas bubble for a second anyway a lone cloud floating wisps of cool air now the cloud is near you you you reach out to it
mmm-kay
its the cloud of your memories of your past your childhood perhaps what do you see in the cloud who is in the cloud
billy billy thompson
there he is hey mackey
oh uh hi billy nice to see ya mkay
come ere
uh well actually i need to get home mkay i uh
you snitched and told the principal i was smoking
oh well uh uh smokings bad uhkay huhhhhh
youre gonna die mackey hold his legs come back here
okay okay okay okay its okay its okay calm down okay turn on the light
what whoa wait what am i doing here
shh be quiet
scuse me where are we
shh youve gotta be quiet billy thompsons out there
what the hells going on
what the hell is going on
the counselors flat top readers are calculating with the boys and the sheep hoarders
oh jesus
what does that mean
it means mr mackeys childhood regression dream is so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it
what
im afraid your son has gone into his counselors dream
aw come on thats stupid hows that hows that even possible
its not stupid at all pinkerton you explain the logic and ill provide the background
alright look it is possible to enter into someone elses dreams send dream trackers to go into a persons subconscious like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them perhaps even planting ideas if one person is regressing deeply enough the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person i talked about whos dreaming and then everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back
yay my bedroom yep this is my happy place mkay
mr mackey
lite brite making things with light what a sight making things with lite brite mkay
mr mackey what are you doing
well this is a lite brite mkay i can make things with light like um birds mkay clowns mkay
come on dude youve gotta wake up
oh yeah my evel knievel doll i can take the motorcycle hmkay i put it on this thing like this okay now crank it back and now i let go okay okay
mr mackey i realize this might be fun for you but it totally isnt for me
hey look whats on its zoom
excuse me i really need to get back to my sheep
im working on it
write zoom z double o m box 350 bos-ton mass oooh two ooone three fouuur mkay
dude please wake up youre a grown man in a psychiatrists office
you can hide in your house for now mackey but tomorrow is the field trip frisco woods and im gonna do things to you youll never forget
no uh billy please uh-kay im really sorry about the smoking thing uh
see you in the woods tomorrow dead man
oh jesus
is that why were here did something really bad happen on the field trip
yeah its probably gonna be bad mkay
oh-ohhhhhhh
ohhhhhhh mkay
what kind of hoarding specialist are you you trapped our son in his counselors subconscious and now youre saying he could die in there
believe me this is the last thing i wanted to have happen
that does it
what are you doing
im goin in if theyre locked into his regression then maybe i can be too
are you crazy mackey is in a very unstable state
damn your incongruities im goin in after my son
its a dream world where mackey can imagine himself to be anything its dangerous
i said get me in there
alright you wanna risk your ass fine you see a cloud its a fluffy cloud floating happy happy fluffy cloud you reach out to it
ahhh
alright kids everyone on the bus
wait wait where the hell are we now
its the day of the big field trip
come on mackey were waitin for ya
oh jesus
mr mackey you have to wake up i dont belong here i need to have my own regression therapy
everyone on the bus now were runnin late
excuse me im actually a sheep herder
its pronounced "hoarder" young man and if you are you should talk to the school counselor about it
yes but i im so- wah- um
please i dont wanna go on your field trip mackey
stan stan
dad is that you
yes its me stan
where are you
its me up here im a butterfly
the hell are you doing dad
im flying free with my beautiful butterfly wings
did you come here to help me
i was gonna but ooh this is fun
dad you gotta stop mackey and bring us back to reality
butterflies have no concern for such things stan im gonna go find me some butterly poon
dad
aah ahhh aha ahhh
aaaaaagh
uh oh somethings wrong
what is it
the father hes gone completely off chart
off chart what does that mean
we dont even know
i told him not to go into the dream after his son he should have waited for the experts to get here
who are the experts
get that door closed keep me covered
ah good youre here
whats the sitch
four people in there all stuck in the middle ones dream
we need to move them all to the next dream level before the projections kill them
what next dream level
alright look right now theyre all trapped in a dream we need to go in and put them under so they can go into a dream within a dream
why
because in the dream within a dream we can protect them from getting to limbo
whats that
empty scary dreamspace
so like a nightmare
no like a nightmare within a nightmare
why cant you wake up from that
you can but someone inside the dream has to kick you awake from the nightmare
that doesnt sound very difficult
it is
why
arrgh
we dont have time for this
uh okay fine so youre gonna take my son to a dream within a dream and then what
then we go into your husbands dreams
okaaay
but your husband will think were in hasselbecks dream
okay wait whos hasselbeck
i am
okay wait no why do we need a football player
sometimes thoughts of my dead wife manifest themselves as trains
are you all saying that you can go into a dream and take people in that dream into their own dream
not all the time just this once and maybe one other time
its so complex and cool
just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesnt make it cool going to multiple dream levels sounds like a really stupid idea
you just dont get it cause youre not smart enough lets move
will they be able to wake mackey up
if they dont itll be the end of europe as we know it
why
because
hello kids my name is ranger pete
hi ranger pete
hi ranger pete mkay
today were gonna be learning all about these amazing evergreens and this fragile ecosystem
oh that should be fun mkay ahhhh
but first we have a very special guest its woodsy owl
oh boy woodsy owl
whos that
"give a hoot dont pollute" mkay
hi im woodsy owl remindin you all to please pick up your trash and keep our forests clean in the city or in the woods
help keep americaaa lookin good mkay oh boy i love that song
alright kids time to split up and go into the forest lets divide you all up into groups of six
we wanna be in mackeys group
oh no that thats mkay well uh well get paired with someone else uh
thats fine you six boys can team up and be our first group in
oh no oh god here it comes unkay
is this the dream or the dream within the dream
i think its the dream inside the matrix inside the dream
oh well just keep shooting
what the fuck
mommy mommy
so youre saying that all those people in there are somehow trapped in one persons dream
yes and so thats why i called the fire department i dont know where else to turn
but wait if those people got stuck in there why wouldnt we
its very simple you see when the dream experts go in they attempt to take the subject to a dream within a dream
like a taco within a taco
a double-decker taco supreme
exactly but only dream spies have the ability to go deeper into dream levels and firemen have the ability to bring ladders into other peoples dreams
wait wait whoa whoa how can you take a ladder into a dream
because the firemen dreams arent like dreams at all theyre more like a dream within a matrix within a dream
somebody order a pizza
no
probably one of them in the dream
alright im goin in
look if we can get the fire department into the counselors dream then we can jump everyone down at least another six dream levels that way well be in the counselors deepest level of subconscious
and it will be like a taco inside a taco within a taco bell thats inside a kfc within a mall thats inside your brain
aaaaaah not again mkay aaaaaah
mr mackey stop running
but but theyre gonna kick my butt mkay theyre gonna kick it bad
look dude whatever happened with those bullies you just have to stop running and face it its just a dream dude you can control what happens stand up to them this time
i know what about i dont remember what they did i just remember the field trip being really bad okay
there he is you cant run forever
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
mr mackey go and face it please so that we can get out of here and find out why were hoarding
but i literally herd sheep
shut up
okay okay i can do this im just gonna stand and and face what happens okay
somebody order pizza pizza
mr mackey must be dreaming about something extremely traumatic
alright that does it get your coat
where are we going
we need to get help from the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world
you dont mean
hello freddy youre looking healthy
chinstrap what happened you run out of stoolies to do your work
alright look were in a pickle again and we need your help got some people trapped inside a dream
told you a long time ago i gave that up
theres some good men stuck in there
i said im done with it
everything all right fred
its fine peg get back in the house
wife and kids
no thanks to you
we need ya fred
like you needed me to kill those teenagers to stop the russians
we had a country to protect
protect it yourselves this time
dammit im not working for the military anymore krueger
then you should have no problem covering it up
some of those trapped are firemen public servants innocent in all of this
alright fine
alright billy im not gonna let you hurt me this time hmkay this time im gonna stand up for myself
you gonna fight back i dont think so
you can do it mr mackey
go ahead and do your worst billy im facing you head-on mkay
alright mackey take this
get the perimeter secure make sure theyre dead
what the hell
we got em the bad memories are dead
alright everyone this is the fire department do not panic
who are you people
we came here to rescue you from the bad guys in mackeys dream
well uh wouldnt it be better to have mackey face them on his own
no as long as the source of the drama is wiped out the counselor can wake up
right
so then why arent we waking up
unless the bullies arent the source of the counselors bad memory
hey thats right the bullies didnt even beat me up that day i i ran away from them
oh whoops
i remember i ran and i ran and i hid in this building here and somebody was in there somebody who talked to me real nice and then and then touched me somewhere bad
no woodsy hmkay dont touch muh pee pee no woodsy please ill give a hoot hmkay
woodsy owl no ill never litter again ill keep all my trash no please woodsy no
whats happening
dream conundrum this is bad
what the hells going on
the bad memory is manifesting itself it didnt wanna be exposed our dream bullets dont hurt it
no no more woodsy
mr mackey you have to wake up now
he cant dont you get it were all gonna go to limbo
theres a real hoot for ya woodsy
its dead its finally dead
somethings happening im getting bogart levels on all counter ups
theyre waking up theyre coming to
ahhh youre back everyone
aw dammit
thanks freddy
if only i could have saved the sheep herder
well did you find the painful source of your hoarding problems mr mackey
i sure did
turns out he was molested by woodsy owl
i completely blocked it from my memory hmkay
so he was hoarding because when he tried to throw things away his subconscious would remember woodsys voice saying "give a hoot dont pollute" and touching his penis with his wing
wow that is so complex and trippy and cool
well now that weve uncovered mackeys source of hoarding we can finally move on to yours stan are you ready for your therapy
i think i have a better idea
stan did you find out the reason youve been hoarding
whatever it is i dont wanna know im just gonna throw this crap away like i should have to begin with
but dude there must be something in your past youre not dealing with
dont care after going through all that crap and seeing what happened to mackey i dont want any part of therapy
how do you know that wasnt your therapy
