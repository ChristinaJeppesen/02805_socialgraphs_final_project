i was diagnosed seven years ago cancer is pure evil it is a fat little lump that needs to be destroyed when there is a cancer you have to "fight" it you cant reason with cancer you cant wish it away cancer doesnt play by the rules so neither can you
my parents said that if i fight-
and you cant listen to what anybody else tells you you have to be willing to give up everything because the cancer will take everything do you understand
yes maam
when you have cancer you fight because it doesnt matter if you beat it or not you refuse to let that fat little lump make you feel powerless
