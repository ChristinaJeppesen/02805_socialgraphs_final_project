my fellow canadians for too long we have been pushed around and ridiculed yesterday was supposed to be a day of appreciation and understanding instead canada appreciation day was mocked worldwide

sweet i think were next in line now
stephen stephen theyre here theyve come to negotiate
what you mean it
okay we did it
who the hell are you
were the ones you told to get internet money
here we made ten million theoretical dollars its all for you
theoretical dollars what am i supposed to do with that you little timewasters
hey we worked really hard to get this theoretical money
yeah everyone thinks im a homo now
you are a homo butters
dude will you just end this thing now my little brother is gonna die
nooooo im not gonna look like an idiot if i fucked up and led everyone astray the last thing im going to do and admit it yes this is the head of the wga the world canadian bureau
ah mr abootman its the global world summit leaders we want to talk to you about the strike
you you do you wanna negotiate
no actually we were just wondering if when youre all dead we can use newfoundland for a new global theme park
hello will you just give this guy something please
excuse me
he just doesnt wanna look like an idiot so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something just just give him anything
well we could give canada some small consolation prize
if they give you something small will you end the strike
will they act like theyre giving canada a lot so everyone thinks i did a good job
can you act like youre giving him a lot
sure why not
we have won
well how much did we get
well we uh we didnt get everything that we wanted but we negotiated hard and we got these coupons to bennigans and free bubblegum for every canadian these coupons entitle every canadian to a free meal at bennigans with the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value of course
we did it
my friends this is the greatest victory in canadian history
ike ike its over
its over
yeah here you go
boy im sure glad thats over with
me too
yeah but you know i learned something today we thought we could make money on the internet but while the internet is new and exciting for creative people it hasnt matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue it will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media
yeah
yeah we did it celebrate everyone woohoo
hold on a minute wait just a second we just did some calculating by not working during the strike canadians lost more than 104 million dollars
and our bennigans coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly three thousand and eight dollars
dont look at that come on friends lets dance
you had no idea what you were doing and now youre trying to make it look like you won so that we wont set you adrift
damn it friends dont you see we won for future canadians guy so the little guy doesnt get pushed around anymore this was a victory for canadas respect
eh what do you think youre doing
were setting you adrift idiot
maybe you can go live with the danish
youll regret this day friend
im not your friend buddih
im not your buddih guy
hes not your guy friend
im not your friend buddih
were not your buddih guy
im not your guy friend
