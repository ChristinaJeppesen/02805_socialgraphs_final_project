whoever he is he is one tough badass
world of warcraft support line
yeah we bought your game and played it online but every time we log in some other player comes in and kills us
oohhh that shouldnt happen we designed the game so that players have to agree to a duel before they can kill each other
yeah well this guy does it anyway
hes a god damned butthole
really thats odd more people calling in about their characters getting killed
oh no
well well certainly keep a look out for that player and ban him from the network better tell the guys upstairs
fellow board members we have a problem somebody in the world of warcraft is ignoring the worlds rulesand is going around killing innocent players
why kill innocent players the game is about finishing quests
weve got to delete him from the servers
we cant whoever this player is he has played world of warcraft so much that he has reached a level we thought unreachable hes actually able to kill our admins and he grows stronger every day
jesus

he just finished killing every single player in the arathi highlands
how many peoples characters were in there
over five thousand
there are over seven million people who log on to world of warcraft are you telling me all those peoples characters are going to die and theres nothing we can do to save them
yes and it wont be long before everyone gets really really frustrated and stops playing altogether gentlemen this could very well lead to the end of the worldof warcraft
no nooooooooo
what the hell are you guys doing dont tell me you all quit playing world of warcraft too
dude were done were sick of getting killed all the time
guys when things look bad you cant just give up on the world of warcraft
we dont have a choice dude that guy killed our characters 14 times
i have a solution you guys that guy can kill us so easily because hes a super-high level right what if we were super-high level too
we cant get to a higher level because that dude doesnt let us finish quests
thats why we just need to log in and stay in the forest killing boars
boars
theres lots of computer-generated boars in warcraft that die with just one blow
dude boars are only worth two experience points apiece do you know how many we would have to kill to get up 30 levels
yes sixty-five million three hundred and forty thousand two hundred and eighty five which should take us seven weeks five days thirteen hours and twenty minutes giving ourselves three hours a night to sleep what do you say guys you can justyou can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin a ball around or you can sit at your computer and do somethin that matters

the admins tell us they are four players from a small town in colorado
are they strong enough to defeat the evil one
we ran the numbers even with their amazing rise in levels they have a 90% mortality probability theyd be walking in a slaughter
there has to besomeway we can help them
what aboutthe sword of a thousand truths
quiet thomas we arent even to speak of that sword
but maybe these new players are the ones the prophecy foretold of
it is not an option
what is this sword
long ago when the world of warcraft was created one of the programmers put a sword called the sword of a thousand truths into the game inventory
apparently it could cause 120 damage per second with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80
but the sword was considered to be too powerful for anyone to possess so it was removed from the game and stored on a one-gig flash drive
but it was foretold that one day players who could wield the sword might reveal themselves
who foretold this prophecy
soltzman hes an accountant
behold the sword of a thousand truths we must get this sword to the ones who have proven they have no life lets just hope to christ they dont start the battle before we can reach them
all right you guys the moment of truth is here it is time for our final battle everyone log in
