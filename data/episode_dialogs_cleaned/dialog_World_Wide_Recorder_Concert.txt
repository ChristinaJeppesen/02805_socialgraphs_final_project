mother did you know that dad never sexually molested me
that that cant be
he never did mom not once
thats not true your father loved you often
he never did mom and i think you knew he never did
nohoho no if i knew i would have made him do it
you stood by and let it happen you saw him come home drunk and then just go right to sleep
im not listening
face it mother he never abused me
uh whats goin on
mother wont hear the truth
he says you didnt molest him as a child
ah-i didnt you knew i didnt
no i didnt know im not listening
you cant close your eyes forever mother mother wait
alright people how many people has a copy we must have-a practiced the song for the performance tomorrow please
okay children we need to play closer attention to the sheet music remember if you get lost just follow along with mr kenny g here
hey thats it kenny maybe kenny g can show us where 92 cents below the lowest eb is then well know the brown noise
(yeah)
and-a one gop seven to-sand o-o-o-o stop stop beh goos sa buh got pee you got dere that was-a terrify that was-a horri-bee what we gonna do
what the hell is that lady talking about
i have no idea
uh mr garrison sr
thuh thats me
uh my name is mr mackey im your school counselor mkay
what can i do for ya
uh-i wanna talk to you about your son—im his n-therapist mkay
uh brother look i didnt sexually abuse my son when he was younger
eh you didnt
no hes upset because i didnt molest him
oh hm uh i guess thats a little different
a little yeah he thinks if i dont molest him it means i dont love him
well now uh whats he supposed to think mr garrison i mean uh look at all the media all the magazine ads and television ads talkin about "sexual molestation" mkay he sees all that and assumes you didnt molest him because of some flaw in his looks or personality
i didnt do it because its wrong
i know i know but im afraid this problem has run very deep through mr garrisons mental state im worried that if you dont do something well it could kill him
hold on a second are you actually suggesting that i have sex with my 41-year-old son
there comes a time in every fathers life when he must ask himself "how far will i go to save my sons life"
well i wont have sex with him
well ive said all i can say i know its difficult but family is about compromises mkay dont lose your son over this mr garrison dont lose your son mkay
am i the only sane person left on earth
tomorrow the whole world will be tuning in as over 4 million children play "my country tis of thee" on their recorders it is by far the largest gathering of little plastic recorders in human history yoko ono has
well mom said i could sleep in the guest room tonight good night dad
good night
words to live by
guess ill just go on up to bed now
uh huh
now i dont really have any pajamas—guess ill just sleep in my boxers or something
should be fine
uh ill leave the door open a little in case you need to see me about anything
wont be necessary
ill just be going up to bed now gueh guess maybe i wont even wear those boxers
im not going to molest you
you dont love me i wanna die
god-damnit
i wish we could find a way to get back at those new yorker kids
yeah they think theyre so cool
you guys you guys we found it we found it you guys
calm down cartman
you found what
the brown noise kenny and me found the brown noise here look look there okay lets see here right there okay okay ready kenny

whoa- oh my god aaww i crapped my pants
thats amazing
i told you guys
dude are you thinking what im thinking
that they should bring back chicago hope for another season totally
no that we could use the brown noise to get back at those asshole new yorker kids
ooooh
yeah dude
they should bring back another season of chicago hope though seriously
ey whats the matter there garrison you look kinda sad
well im having some troubles at home
well come on tell us about it we always help each other out dont we fellas
yeah
yeah thats right
yeah
all right its just that i mean were all family men here right
sure
yeah we are
i am i know that
well can i ask you guys a difficult question
absolutely
of course
yeah man
come on garrison
alright would you have sex with your son to save his life
oh this is one of them scruples questions aint it
nono i got a better one would you have sex with your mother to save your fathers life
wooo yeah
oh like if someone had a gun to your fathers head and said "have sex with your mother or else ill shoot him"
yeah
oh thats a tough one
hmmm
no no wait uh you dont understand
how about if someone made you have sex with your mother and father to save your own life
no no no way no
but if it was to save my mothers life uh-i think i would have to have sex with my father
yeup
me too
well i think that goes without saying
weh actually im just talking about a son
well personally i would have sex with my son to save to save my mothers life it depends uh- how big a gun are we talkin here
uh he doesnt have a gun
the father doesnt have a gun
no nobodys got a gun
i think if someone said "have sex with your mother or else im gonna kill your son" but he didnt have a gun i wouldnt do it
he could have a knife though
yeah
sure
yeah a knife
if a killer put a knife to my throat and said "have sex with your father or else im gonna kill your mother while having sex with you" i would have sex with myself
yeah i would
thats right
uh huh
that makes sense
mm-hm
wasnt that right
mm see
how do we write the note cartman
lowest eb lets see i think it looks like this
alright now all we do is wipe out the last note on their sheet music and change it to the note cartman played come on there that should do it
sweet i cant wait to see them crap their pants in front of everybody you guys
okay lets get back to the room
