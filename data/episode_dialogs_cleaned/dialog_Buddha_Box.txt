i dont know where to start first it was all the school shootings then these wi-fi scooters showed up and now we know that manbearpig is real and we could all be dead in a matter of years
and you believe this all relates somehow to the movie black panther not being as good as everyone says it was
i know theres a connection but that isnt what matters i cant deal with people anymore its just everyone sucks so hard you know everybody is so stupid and they all walk around going "nya na chai cha nyachacha chai cha" and the only thing that makes me happy the only thing i can trust is this but all people do is try to keep me from it
ill be in my room and my mom will come in and say
"eric thats enough time on your phone"
and then at school
"eric" "what are you doing you cant use your phone at school"
and even my friends my own friends theyll be like
"hey cartman throw us the ball youre the goddamn quarterback"
its like everybody needs something from me all i want is a little time with my phone instead of always listening to peoples needy bullshit
oh ahh dya sorry just uh well you know young people have so much to deal with today i believe that what you have is anxiety
anxiety is that cool
its pretty common these days what it really is more than anything is an excuse to be lazy and lame to everyone around you

we live in a world of many distractions its hard to find peace

but now you can have it with buddha box simply fit the patented box on your head and set its bluetooth to your mobile device
inside buddha box your phone is projected two inches from your face and the noise-canceling headphones let you hear your phone without any outside noise giving you peace from
that annoying uber driver who wants to talk

i want to be enlightened like the buddha but ive got these fucking kids
let buddha box take you to a place of peace and serenity where you can have quality uninterrupted time with your phone

can we get another goalie please
oh yeah sure yeah because people with anxiety shouldnt be allowed to play sports right kyle you know our world is dark and scary enough without people like you making us feel inferior asshole

river bailey emory
its okay were gonna find them
i cant believe you were on your phone
you were on your phone too
it was my time to be on the phone you were on yours all morning
youre seriously gonna make this all my fault
yes
because last time i checked you didnt even want me around as a partner to the pc babies even though i-
oh god im not doing this again
even though you need me to do shit for you every 10 fuckin minutes you dont get to just say whatever you- oh okay cool fine with me im the one who has a fuckin problem on their fuckin phone you know usually im afraid to tell you what i really think but you wanna know something you wanna- you wanna know what i really think
anxiety can make you feel unable to cope but living with someone who has anxiety can be a bit of a roller coaster as well we have to support our loved ones with their anxiety and try to understand their illness
i just feel that craig has changed so much lately he barely even talks to me anymore
well because his anxiety make him feel like anything he says might sound wrong thats why we must nurture our loved ones so they feel safe
eric i just feel like you have so much to offer the world and it kills me that youre so afraid to let your inner you shine
heh heh that guys such a douche what was that what was that one show he was on
maybe you you wanna text him that
oh yeah thats it bj and the bear that show was so dumb what kind of monkey was that anyway what was that- what was that monkey he always had- wait what the what the hell is this oh god damnit mom will you stop texting me im trying to relax
look were all just trying to understand this condition and its like youre not listening
were doing everything we can to keep our anxiety under control do you think i even wanna be here right now i am freaking out
can we go now
heheh yeah thats pretty cool
hey hey whats goin on here why arent you people workin
we cant keep buildin sir we got a bunch of protesters who wont let us work
protesters who
ah its just a bunch of pc babies who think building this thing is wrong
all right all right what do you pc babies want
i guess theyre upset because the new viaduct is being financed by a state rather than a county institution
aw come on pc babies why does that matter
i guess the state refused to finance a proposed program on race-relation education an they see it as hypocritical
god damnit not everyone cares about race-relation programs come on pc babies we got a job to do
all right all right just calm down lady you want to file a missing persons report
no no we dont want to file anything specific we just need help finding some pc babies
pc babies they usually hang out at the liberal arts colleges you could find some there
nono its five specific pc babies
tony wasnt there a report of some pc babies down at the mexican border
no no these pc babies wouldnt have gotten that far they can barely walk im their mother
hokay okay last name
woman
first name
strong
okay and youre the father
no
im her superior at work
dont be ridiculous
you think i took advantage of my position
im not some two-bit floozy who goes around sleeping with her boss i am a strong woman those kids were born naturally by in-vitro fertilization
im not harvey weinstein all right i have nothing but respect for females at my workplace and i would never compromise that position
well uh see what we can do in the meantime youll just have to take a seat and wait
go go
what do you want
go down the slide or get out of the way
you think i even want to be here kyle my therapist told me i need to force myself to go out and do things to overcome my anxiety
can we move him please
oh oh i see people with anxiety shouldnt be allowed at water parks is that it kyle hey everybody just so you know kyle thinks people with anxiety should just stay home yeah im trying to come out of my shell but dr kyle here is just worried about his place in line
get off my towel get off my towel
god damnit i seriously cant get a minute of peace why is it that people who dont have a buddha box are always flipping buddha boxes off the heads of people with anxiety
i got news for you cartman everyone has anxiety everyone gets nervous everyone is afraid being around people everyone has feelings theyd rather stay home alone and you know what they do they get over it and they stop being a piece of shit
everyone has anxiety
yes
oh my god i know what i have to do now yo-youre right kyle youre right
what no no what did i just do
should have just let him be on his phone dude
you know what the kids like today they like music that matters i think you guys got what it takes to be the next big thing the pc babies thats what im talkin about that stuff is raw everyone loves you pc babies were gonna make you famous
all right pc babies lets hear what you got
all right south park and now heres that special treat we told you about live with us in the studio is a hot new band the pc babies theyre gonna perform their new song which is about the injustice of white people in dreadlocks its called "weeaaagh"
riley
tha-thats bailey
its the pc babies guess theyre all the rage now
cone on
to quiet ones mind one must have a dialog with ones self i have found enlightenment but there are so many others who suffer its very important to take the time to shut out the outside world in the hindu religion theres a saying "namaste" it means "fuck you i have anxiety" at first i thought it was only a few of us but then something was said to me by kyle he said "eric my friend everyone has anxiety" i know what youre thinking "fuck kyle" and normally i would agree with you but hear his words everyone has anxiety we must recognize this disease as an epidemic yes fuck kyle but mayor we have to raise money to get everyone who has anxiety the tools they need to cope
and how do you think we get that money how do you suggest we do this
namaste
na-ma-ste
fuck you too
that was far out pc babies you really rocked the airwaves now come on we got a photo shoot at 5
kids
youre okay thank god
who the hell are you
im their vice principal
yea and ah-im their principal we need to get these kids back to school
you cant do that these are the pc babies dont you know how big they are in just one day they protested a bar stopped construction of a problematic viaduct and wrote a hit single about cultural appropriation
they did all that
oh my god they had their first protests and we missed it we missed everything because we were on our phones
ive always used the phone as a way to deal with the stress of having babies nobody could know the truth about but its only made it worse
you know what we have to do right
yeah i think so
all right everyone listen up the vice principal and i have been discussing student health and its our firm belief that they need and what we all need is less time on our phones yes yes i know its an unpopular idea but just hear me out please our phones are the cause of stress not the relief from it we are banning phones and buddha boxes and we suggest you all strictly limit their use at home as well
i dont think anyones listening to you
yeah nobodys listening and nobodys watching
i guess we can wait and ban the boxes tomorrow
you keep brushing that hair back out of your eyesand it just keeps falling and so do ii am feeling like the luckiest man alivetodayand i dont know about tomorrowright now the whole world feels rightand the memory of a day like todaycan get you through the rest of your life
