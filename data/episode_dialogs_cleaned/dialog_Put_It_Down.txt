the human interest cupcake story has apparently been heard by the president just moments ago the president tweeted "i know that kid tweek hes fucking with you north korea get a clue ill bet he took a dump in the batter"

what is that
im not sure
daaah daaah
no agreement has been reached between the parties involved breaking news now out of colorado where the north koreans appeared to have fired a missile over tweeks house
daahaahaah
tweek of course the young boy who got the attention of kim jong-un last week the news media in north korea is calling the missile test a victory for its people
today the great country of north korea has proven its determination and fortitude by successfully firing a missile over tweeks house perhaps now tweek will come fight-
oh my god oh my god why is this happening to me they have to know that this isnt my fault
in response to the north korean test the president of the united states has just tweeted this statement "you really think tweek is scared tweek will single handedly go to north korea and fuck all you slanty-eyed bitches doggy style"
whaaat why would he say that
the president also tweeted "if you even think tweek is worried about a bunch of dipshit poor-ass third world rice pickersthink again"
oh my god what is he doing
tweek tweek calm down
why wont he just stop why
tweek tweek here heres your fidget spinner
why does he keep making it worse
fidget spinner tweek come on son focus on the fidget spinner
aww jeez looks like north korea launched another missile
oh really like another test where are you looking
im on drudge you see what the president tweeted about it

yeah you didnt hear gary borkovec got ran over by a distracted driver
what gary borkovec is he dead
yeah dude hes dead
oh that son of a bitch im gonna talk to the principal put down that candle kenny like you ever gave a shit about gary borkovec
entree vous
pc principal im trying to raise suicide awareness but everyones preoccupied with this "dont be on your phone when driving" crap
gary borkovec was a good student he didnt deserve to be taken away by someone not paying attention to the road
yes but gary borkovec is already dead theres nothing we can do for him students need to focus on people thinking about dying
i dont know what more you want from me bro
i cant just get people to care with a stupid rap song i need a full orchestra woodwinds strings i need black people in white robes white people in black robes and a thousand doves to release into the air
i can give you two student volunteers and one pigeon
do you have any idea how serious this is as someone who deals with suicidal thoughts i cannot believe the lack of concern at this school maybe i should just take the awareness of my suicide out to the public on the streets
maybe you should
maybe i will
maybe you should
maybe i will
waaaah
ugh wuh hey tweek
look at what the president tweeted now
what time is it dude
just read it
"north korea doesnt have the balls to attack tweek they have little tiny rice balls"
theyre gonna get me craig look at whats on cnn
and the presidents tweets have certainly caught the attention of north korea who have been spending the past several days viewing possible targets for a nuclear strike if war were to break out
waaaah what am i gonna do
youve gotta calm down
how am i supposed to calm down north korea is gonna get me theyre gonna get me
tweek tweek tweek lets think this through logically north korea isnt going to attack anyone okay theyre not going to start a war they cant win okay
but craig i-
tweek you have to stop thinking about it tell you what were gonna go somewhere fun and make you feel better
give a minute of your time for suicide awareness suicide is serious help tell people like kyle its not a joke
hey good for you guys trying to help
yeah make sure everyone you know gets involved or else im gonna do it
were getting a lot of attention eric our web sites already full of kids saying they feel the same way as you and want to get help
they want to get help for what
for wanting to take their own lives
no this is about me killing myself
but babe theres a lot of kids who feel the same way you do
theyre full of shit heidi theyre just trying to get attention what are you actually talking online to these ass wipes
i thought this was about raising awareness and helping people
so youre just gonna e-mail with every guy who has a dick and a death wish are we just your type
eric come on
no look heidi im sorry but youre the one who started all this by telling everybody that i was suicidal okay now im under a lot of pressure to do it so the only option i have is to make sure that suicide prevention becomes this entire towns number one priority
oh god did you see what the president said about asians now
look out
oh are you freaking serious
okay babe what do you want to ride first
ugh what are we doing here craig
were gonna get your mind off politics and have some fun now whats your favorite ride
the ferris wheel
isnt this lovely tweek just look at that view
oh god another tweet from the president
oh come on
"why would the us be scared of north korea tweek is so not scared hes at an amusement park in denver right now" jesus christ weve gotta get out of here
tweek tweek use your brain north korea isnt going to attack an amusement park youre safer here than anywhere
oh jeez the president just called kim jong-un a fat midget oh and now north korea is saying that theyre gonna-
dad look out
oh shit
all right everyone please wait for your bumper cars to come to a complete stop we hope you enjoyed crazy cars-
mommy look out
oh my god what is that what is that
its probably nothing everythings fine
will you please stop saying that i cant take it
im trying to make you feel better
well maybe i dont wanna feel better right now
okay but think about that that actually doesnt make any sense
why do you have to be so logical i dont need you to problem-solve all the time i need you to augh i dont know
tweek honey all week youve been freaking out and ive been the one forced to deal with it
you havent been dealing with it youve been trying to make it go away because my emotions are freaking you out
tweek north korea isnt bombing anyone they would lose the support of china and that would mean-
there you go again stop preaching facts to me its not what i need
well im sorry that im actually in control of my goddamn emotions you baby oh see now you made me lose control of my emotions god dammit
hey craig how come tweeks not at school
how should i know
uh oh trouble in paradise
look guys tweek doesnt want help okay he just wants to overreact
hey guys can we have your attention tomorrow night well be having a memorial service for all the students weve lost to distracted driving we hope you can all bring your families
cool yeah hey guys and theres also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 730 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium were gonna have lots of games and face-painting and uh what are you guys gonna have
uhw-were gonna have some guest speakers and also provide grievance counselors for those who need it
yeah grievance counseling that sounds super fun listen guys theres a very real chance i might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow so you dont want to miss it suicide prevention pot luck everybody
eric you need to stop what theyre doing is important
theyre doing a memorial service with speeches and crying whats that gonna solve
its not about problem-solving eric its about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel people need help sorting out their emotions sometimes and the best thing isnt always quick answers but just being there supporting each other and talking through those feelings
you are so up and down i dont know what you want from me heidi
come on there has to be a way we can all work together here
so now youre on their side oh my god im seriously gonna do it right now
eric
tweek whats going on
what what do you mean whats going on the same shit thats been going on
nothings gotten any better oh my god how does that make you feel
i feel scared i feel alone
well that must be horrible to feel that way it must be hard for you to even think
it is its terrible
i bet its terrible what else are you feeling
like like i have no control over my life like im just a pawn in a big game
oh thats a terrifying thought you must feel trapped
yeah like trapped but like completely unable to even move
jesus its like theres no solution to any of this what are you gonna do what can you do
i dont know its its like maybe maybe i have to find a way to feel a little in charge of me again
that sounds so insurmountable though how would you even start
i dont know but i ive gotta do something about this theres gotta be a way i can thank you craig ive got it people arent focused on the right thing i know what i should do
