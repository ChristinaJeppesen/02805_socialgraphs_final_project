herro crisis and fear tonight as what appears to be a massive flood has overtaken the town of beaverton colorado home of the worlds largest beaver dam earlier today a break in the beaver dam which protected the town broke open trapping people in their houses and destroying their lives
oh my gosh those poor people
tom im currently ten miles outside of beaverton unable to get inside the town proper we do not have any reports of fatalities yet but we believe that the death toll may be in the hundreds of millions beaverton has only a population of about eight thousand tom so this would be quite devastating
any word on how the survivors in the town are doing mitch
w-were not sure what exactly is going on inside the town of beaverton uh tom but were reporting that theres looting raping and yes even acts of cannibalism
my god youve youve actually seen people looting raping and eating each other
no no we havent actually seen it tom were just reporting it
you all done with your fishsticks stan
ill help you sharon boy thats just awful
in the nearby town of south park the cause of the beaverton flood is being investigated
thats right we know whose fault this is
huh oh
its george bushs fault
yeah george bush doesnt care about beavers
george bush didnt break that beaver dam it was terrorists and al qaeda
theyve been secretly building beaver dam wmds for years now
mom dad the theyre gonna go help those people right
i dont know you know to me it seems like the mayor of beaverton shouldve done something about that dam years ago
dont blame the mayor sharon what about fema think this whole thing is really their fault
ye-but uh s-somebodys gonna help the people off their their rooftops right
thats not important right now son whats important is figuring out whose fault this is
dude dude did you see the news last night
yeah
you saw all those people trapped on their roofs
shyeah that was pretty funny
pretty funny dude we did that that was our fault
hehey no we arent the ones who built a town beneath a giant beaver dam okay thats their fault
but theyre trapped now and nobodys helping them
well they shouldve gotten out of there
maybe they couldnt get out
we did
dude ah i just ah i dont know what to do here
ah ah ah ah i know what youre thinking stan youre thinking youre gonna go tell kyle look i know you think hes your best friend but kyle is a jew rat he has his jew ethics while he hoards his greedy jew gold and he will jew you out if you tell him about this
hey dudes
oh hey kyle
sorry i couldnt make it yesterday whatd you guys do
nothing
hngh totally
hey everybody they just found out what caused the flood in beaverton
aw crap
quiet children quiet we need to hear
at first nobody knew what caused the dam to break but now shocking new evidence has indicated that the flood in beaverton was caused by global warming it now appears that all rumors of global warming were true we were warned this would happen and we didnt listen we didnt listen all the top colorado geologists have gathered at the governors office for an emergency meeting
ladies and gentlemen if global warming has in fact already caused the beaverton flood then this is only the beginning the effects are going to spread what we are looking at is a global warming catastrophe the likes of which weve never seen
excuse me sir but when when is this going to happen
my colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests but we believe it may happen the day after tomorrow
excuse me im sure were all very impressed with your wild theories doctor uh marsh but the fact is no statistical proof has ever been confirmed that global warming exists are you suggesting we shut down the economy
with all due respect clich√© dissenting republican the economy isnt going to matter the day after tomorrow
listen listen weve finished running the tests
global warming is going to strike two days before the day after tomorrow
oh my god thats today
we didnt listen
stan get in the car we have to evacuate
we didnt listen
come onnn come on
its useless this traffic isnt moving
dad isnt it possible the flood wasnt caused by global warming i i mean the water was held back by a giant beaver dam after all
no stan im afraid us adults just let you children down we didnt take care of our earth and now youve inherited our problems
we didnt listen
we we didnt listen come on everyone grab what you can we have to walk
oh jesus here it comes
global warming
its coming here comes global warming
we didnt listen
come on hurry
its right behind us its coming the other way
go back go back
everyone into the community center hurry go
get inside we have to close these doors
come on weve got to board up that last window seal off all the doorways we must try to protect ourselves from the global warming
mr garrison are you all right
im in pretty bad shape my leg is broken and my left boob is leaking
here you go sweetheart
mom you know those people in beaverton are still trapped in the flood
i know but im afraid its too late for them sweetie we have to try and save ourselves now
shh shh weve got the television working
this is a fox news update global warming disaster
global warming appears to have struck as predicted in the colorado rockies all around the country panic and chaos are settling in
tom i am standing just outside of chicago where the panic of global warming has already caused countless deaths already were reporting that the death toll here in chicago is over 600 billion people
oh god
this is all your fault jimbo
me
yeah you drive that damn suv around you didnt even think about global warming didja
can you believe it stan i never thought global warming could happen so fast i guess i didnt listen
kyle it it isnt global warming
huh
global warming isnt happening right now its its not what caused the beaverton flood
how do you know that
because i know what did cause the flood
george bush
no
terrorists

communists
no
chinese radicals
no
cartman
sort of
cartman flooded beaverton
shh not not exactly we were messing around in this guys new boat and cartman egged me on and and i crashed it into the beaverton dam
dude you have to tell everyone right now
hey stan oh goddammit you told kyle didnt you
stan people in beaverton are still trapped on their roofs nobodys helping them because they think they cant go outside
oh here we go see i told you if youre so caring kyle why dont you share some of your jew gold with the people caught in the flood
look maybe maybe we can help those people in beaverton ourselves
how
why
we can sneak out of here get a boat and go help them off their roofs that way i can do the right thing but still lie about it
listen listen everyone nobody can leave this building
but we need supplies food silicone
you go outside and youll die by now the global warming has shifted the climate bringing on a new ice age within the hour the temperature outside will fall to over 70 million degrees below zero
jesus
all we can do is try to wait it out as long as we can
and the rest of the country
everyone below this line will have to be evacuated to the south everyone above this line is already dead people like us in the middle states have to ride it out the balmy southwestern states might have a chance but new york will have tidal waves that envelop all of the northeast what frank aw awww goddammit
