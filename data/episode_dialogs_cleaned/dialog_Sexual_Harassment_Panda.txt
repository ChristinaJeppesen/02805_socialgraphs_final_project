okay children lets take our seats we have something very important to discuss due to recent events around the country ive been instructed to teach you all about sexual harassment in school
about what
now does anybody know what sexual harassment means yes eric
when youre trying to have intercourse with a lady friend and some other guy comes up and tickles your balls from behind
no eric thats not what im talking about the school board has sent over a special guest to teach us all about sexual harassment in schools please welcome peetie the sexual harassment panda
who lives in the east neath the willow treesexual harassment pandawho explains sexual harassment to you and mesexual harassment panda"dont say that dont touch theredont be nasty" says the silly bearhes come to tell you whats right and wrongsexual harassment pandahi boys and girls
say "hi" to sexual harassment panda
hi sexual harassment panda
hababah
did you know that when one little panda pulls on another little pandas underwear thats sexual harassment that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda
this is freaking me out dude
and when one little panda puts his furry little willy in another pandas ear that makes me a very sad panda now im going to pass out these booklets and were going to go through each and every sexual harassment law
awgh
"article 36 section 19 one panda may not make sexual comments about another pandas appearance if said panda does make"
ohh dude get me out of here
i think sexual harassment panda is cool
you would think that you little ass-sucker
what did you call me
an ass-sucker it means you suck ass you see an ass you suck it youre an ass-sucker
that does it i am suing you for sexual harassment
uh-oh
what
you have sexually harassed me for the last time it says right here that now i can sue you and take all of your money
thats right he can
no you cant you little ass-sucker
oh you did it again you all heard him
"the first party of the first panda may sue the second-party panda unless that panda was said panda aforementioned panda"
this is cartman vs marsh case no 3433 what is your complaint mr cartman
your honor my lawyer is just parking the car he should be here any second
dude he got a lawyer
sorry im late
dad
oh hi kyle
all right lets move this along shall we now eric cartman uh you claim that stan marsh sexually harassed you in school
th that is correct my honor
hoh whatever
he talked about having oral sex with my ass
i called you an ass-sucker
yes that was it i was suh-so upset i couldnt concentrate the rest of the day and the way his eyes kept looking at me slowly going up and down my body like he was undressing me with his eyes
what cartman you call people names all the time
as you can see your honor my client is too upset to continue
mr marsh what do you have to say
wwhat do you mean
i need to hear your defense
uh im eight
all right this seems pretty open-and-shut stan marsh under the new sexual harassment in schools law i am forced to find you guilty
huh
all right we did it
hooray
since the defendant is underage and has no monetary resources it is the judgment of this court that 50% of stan marshs belongings are to be handed over to eric cartman immediately
i have to give him half my stuff
sweet
lets see i want that clown criminy game and that power jim doll and lets see do you really like this remote-controlled truck
yeah dude thats my favorite toy
oh well ill just take that then and what about this is this one of your favorites
uh no i hate that toy
oh then you wont mind if i take it
damnit
here you go as your legal fee you can choose between the green choo-choo or the squishy football
hm you know eric ive been thinking uh
uh-huh that model airplane kit go on
uh you know the people really responsible for your harassment is the public schools perhaps we should sue them next
what but uh why should i sue the school
well because theyre the ones that let this harassment go on and they have a lot more money i think we could get a lot more out of this than half of stans belongings
interesting ooo stans asthma inhaler i want that
answer the question did you know that sexual harassment was going on in the classroom
no i had no freakin idea
mr garrison do you know the definition of sexual harassment
of course and so does mr hat we do not tolerate sexual harassment
you are the witness here mr garrison not mr hat
im sorry toots
did you or did you not hear my client being called an ass-sucker
yes
and you did nothing
well he is a little ass-sucker
mr garrison i will remind you that we are in court
okay baby im sorry
principal victoria were you aware that my client was being harassed at your school
well not any more than any other student
oh so you admit that harassment goes on
i dont know
you dont know youre the principal
i cant be around every second
so it does go on
all right all right i killed him i hit him over the head and i cut up the body i tried to burn him but it wouldnt burn oh the smell of it i put the legs in garbage bags and hid the torso under a bridge i had to do it oh god
principal victoria was eric cartman called an ass-sucker yes or no
i believe so yes
thats sexual harassment
last id like to bring up my expert witness sexual harassment panda
who lives in the caves neath the willow treesexual harassment panda
expert witness did south park elementary allow sexual harassment to go on
well when one little panda asks another little panda to perform oral sex that is sexual harassment
and whos to blame
im afraid the law states that the school must be held responsible
there you have it straight from the horses mouth
panda
pan-pandas mouth
after careful review it is the judgment of this court that south park elementary pays eric theodore cartman $13 million in damages
all right we did it eric
its time to celebrate yeahits time to celebrate yeah
that goes in the master bedroom well kyle what do you think of your new house
its big
yes it is big isnt it it is very big
dad if the school has to pay you and cartman $13 million where does that money come from
well kyle schools have lots of money you see we all pay taxes and part of that tax money goes to public schools and its from that money that we got our 13 million
and you dont see a problem with that
no its a very fragile system that nature has designed all things flow into each other
youre trying to confuse me now arent you
sort of yeah
okay children theres a few changes being made here at school but lessons will go on as normal any questions yes stan
wheres our desks
right desks well a lot of cuts had to be made since the schools funding is short for lawsuits
you see cartman you see what this has done
all i know is i got this sweet digital watch and these cool shoes im telling you guys suing people kicks ass
wow i wanna sue somebody
me too i wanna get a lawyer
yeah
(woohoo)
well lets just try to cope with the changes and do our schoolwork now im gonna write a sentence on the board and i want you to tell me the noun
aaggghhh
i know i know im sorry children but we cant afford chalk anymore i have to write on the chalkboard with this rusty nail anyway children in the sentence "the ball is red"
aagggghhh
kids are you tired of being harassed at school sick of being called a homo a farty-pants a butt- face then call me kyles dad and ill help you close the lid on sexual harassment in schools
after a boy in my class tried to put his tongue in my mouth i knew i needed legal help kyles dad helped me get a $16 million settlement and this bright new shiny bicycle thank you kyles dad
kyles dad got me 14 million and he can do it for you too just look at all these beautiful girls
so call me kyles dad because its not about money its about wait what am i saying call me
kids picking on you well dont be sadjust sue their asses with kyles dad
all right what other cuts do we have to make to the school budget
uh next we have tom morris he plays sexual harassment panda at the schools

hello sexual harassment cubswho lives in the caves neath the willow treesexual harassment panda
uh uh have a seat mr morris
who
uh s-sexual harassment panda
oh all right
uhâ€”m-m-m-mr morris we at the school board have been thinking and weve decided that perhaps a "panda" isnt the best way to explain sexual harassment to children
you see mr morris we believe that a panda doesnt really have anything to do with sexual harassment at all
im afraid were just going to have to let you go
im a sa-a-a-a-ad panda
eric cartman it is the judgment of this court that you sexually harassed pip philip at school
no way

as sexual harassment lawsuits increase all over the state the mother of all trials is set to begin the sexual harassment case of everyone vs everyone begins tomorrow no matter what the outcome the public schools are sure to lose at least a whopping $30 million representing the side of everyone is gerald broflovski the lawyer from south park who plans to make quite a commission representing the side of everyone else is gerald broflovski so whatever the outcome things look very bright for kyles dad personally i think kyles dad is just a whore taking advantage of everyone in town and this just in newscaster kevin mccarty is being sued by kyles dad for slander the newscaster has yet to be reached for comment wait

but im just a panda
no youre not dude youre a guy in a panda costume
heeyy im a real worm pal
okay sorry sorry
youre-youre a worm thats-thats cool thats cool
okay you are a panda but being sexual harassment panda isnt helping anyone right now you used to use your panda powers to teach people about sexual harassment but now you need to teach a new message a new message that people will find useful again
what message
that people shouldnt sue each other all the time
you know you little cubs might just be right
yeah
okay
your honor id like to make my closing arguments
wait
hey its sexual harassment panda
no hes a whole new panda now and hes got something to say
hello everyone im peetie the "dont sue people" panda
"dont sue people" panda
hey we dont take kindly to folks that dont sue people round here
nuhow skeeter he aint hurtin nobody
listen to me when you sue somebody it hurts everyone you sue for money but where do you think that money comes from from the schools from taxes from the state from you theres no such thing as free money when you sue somebody you take money away from parks and schools and charities and put it in your own pocket and that makes me a sa-a-a-a-ad panda
im a sad panda too
im a really sad panda i didnt know we were doing all that damage this is all that damn lawyers fault
yeah lets sue the lawyer
yeah
no dont you see th-the pandas right boy what a great message he has when you sue people you just end up causing a lot of problems for society uhwell ive really learned something today all i could see was the millions of dollars coming to me and i didnt care about where the money came from well im no longer doing sexual harassment lawsuits in schools theyre too vague and too easily corruptible thank you sexual harassment panda
"dont sue people" panda
yeah well whatever sooo lets not sue anyone again okay come on guys lets go get some ice cream
hooray
pandas love ice cream
well seeing as we have no lawyers im throwing the case out case dismissed
hey we dont take too kindly to cases being dismissed around here
god damnit skeeter shut the hell up
hello cubs im "dont sue people" panda with an important message for you lawsuits damage our society i know its tempting to make money but just remember that money has to come from somewhere and usually it ends up hurting a lot of innocent people so until next time dont let frivolous sexual harassment lawsuits ruin our schools good-bye now
