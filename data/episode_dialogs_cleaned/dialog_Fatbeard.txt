well well well well well well well well well kyle you came all this way to try and join my pirate club
no fatass i came to get my brother we all have to get out of here it isnt safe
"it isnt safe" thats not what you said back in the cafeteria kyle in the cafeteria you said somalia was "awesome"
i know i was lying then
or are you lying now so many lies kyle you cant even keep them straight you just couldnt stand that we were living in paradise while you were back home
this isnt paradise and you know it the people here are starving and dying the whole world has used somalia as a dumping ground for toxic waste even the fish here are radioactive cartman just give me my brother and let us get out of here
your brother is with butters taking inventory of our latest plunder kyle you just sit tight till we hear about your ransom money hmhmm
one box of italian passports one necklace gold three crewmember watches
ey excuse me can i ask you a question
oh uhuh sure galeed
why did you americans come here
well cause our lives sucked back home we had all these rules and homework
yeah homework
and our parents hollered at us
yeah
so we wanted to come here and be pirates
piewets
but thats what i do not understand why would anyone "want" to be a pirate
huh
every day i dream that i can go to school learn about the world but my mother she is dyin of aids and there is no money for medicine my father was killed trying to find food for us do you know how i feel every time we try to capture a boat scared and not just scared because i might get killed but scared because if i dont get something out of it my family and friends are going to die i dont want to be a pirate i dont see how anybody would
oh my god
jeez guess we kind of got put in our place huh ike
i feel like an asshole
yeah me too
go on walk the plank you scurvy dog
cartman knock it off
thats captain cartman you jewswoggle
"do you think all american kids are as crazy as these are"
"its starting to look that way"
eric hey eric listen we wanna go home
what
me and ike well weve been talkin and well guys we really had it pretty good back in america i mean sure its easy to think our lives are boring and full of rules but a lot of people have it way worse the pirates life isnt a life of fun and adventure its a life of hardship and suffering when you get down to it well we were pretty lucky to have the lives we did
clyde
i hate it here and i wanna go home
you guys cannot leave the pirate club now how can you not want to stay in this paradise weve created in somalia people have no laws they have no rules and they never grow old
they never grow old because they die before theyre 30
nobodys goin anywhere im the captain of this outfit to arms now is there any question whos in charge i have an entire pirate crew willing to do anything for me
"hey whats that"
alright men remember do not hit the white ones
me and my crew are gonna go on piratin forever
