little jason white was a happy child a playful child and ultimately it was his playfulness in sports that got him killed in a freak hit-and-run accident the father would like to now say a few words
im robert white jasons father and i can tell you that as a white jason lived a challenged life when i look out on this congregation i cant help but think "theres not a whole lot of people here" doesnt seem like a big deal nobodys outraged cause it was our family nobody cares when a white gets killed by the police there should be protests and marches but no the police killed a white thats not protest-worthy everybodys busy trying to lock up randy marsh now my wife and i have a dead child and we cant even get any weed to make us feel better yeah dont listen to me im just a white
kids i have something to tell you but i dont want you to be scared okay daddy is in police custody until theres a hearing he could be in jail for a long time
do you promise
like how long is "a long time" could it be years
it could be sweetheart we dont know
yes
is it possible he could get out of it
of course its possible honey
egh
but if he doesnt get out of it then what happens to us
we probably have to sell the farm and move back to town and sort of live our lives without the marijuana business and without daddy juts try to stay hopeful kids
we will mom you too
okay you too shelly
okay mom you too
what who oh okay sure put him through this is the president
hi mr ga- mr president uh im really sorry to bother you look uh im in a bit of trouble

yeah they uh someone got some supposed evidence on me doing something "illegal" and uh
well did you tell everyone you didnt do anything wrong
y-yeah of course
well did you then go on the attack and swap the accusations to make yourself a victim
did i what
oh jeez darvo randy deny attack reverse victim and offender alright lets role-play you be your accusers and i be you okay go
uh uhm "hey you you blew up peoples yards who were growing their own marijuana"
"no i didnt are you joking you psychopath now youre blowin up my yard" go ahead try another one
"you you illegally damaged property and made your business-"
"you damage property to make your business more profitable you lying sack of shit im not gonna be bullied by you" see its really not that hard just takes a little chin wiggle

sheila gerald hi
hi sharon we just know youre going through a really hard time right now we wanted to bring you guys some lasagna
oh thats so sweet thank you other families have brought some stuff too come on in hey guys we got lasagna
i love lasagnaaa
no running in the house you little turkeys
oh look at that sharon you took down all the pictures of marijuana
oh yeah you know just too painful you know they remind me of randy thats why i took randys pictures as well because you know they remind me of randy
look im sorry if you dont want to talk about it but have you thought of what you guys might do if randy gets put away
yeah ive kind of made a list of all the things i might do its kind of a long list
oh isnt this lovely the whole town turning out to support the marsh family in their time of need our son was killed by the police
why
would have been nice if somebody had brought us some lasagna you know if im not mistaken it almost seems like you people are happy that tegridy farms is being indicted its almost like youre reveling in it my wife and i were both tegridy plus members we always believed in randy marsh we believed in tegridy and now theres less whites now theres less whites
oh jeez we should have never played football that close to the road
yeah this isnt right
wu-where are you going eric
i think i might be able to help them
mr and mrs white im sorry about what happened i knew jason pretty well he was a shitty receiver but he would have wanted his parents to move on and help a new child
what what do you mean
a few weeks ago i was sent somewhere it was a place where people like you could find a way to fill that empty hole
welcome everyone my name is jeff were thrilled youve come to help out and adopt the parents of the children inside have all been deported but the kids are legal citizens since they were born in the united states mr and mrs white
yes
weve all heard about your tragic loss id love to help out however i can is there something specific youre looking for
we dont really know
well weve got all kinds here depending on your preferences heres a little panamanian theyre very clean this is a colombian shorthair oh and this is a good one this is a baja shepherd
quiero a mi papá quiero a mi mamá
bien gracias ¿y tú
oh honey look at the peruvian hairless
yes theyre pretty silly-looking great with kids though
hey whats this little guy
oh why this is a purebred mexican hes had all his shots parents were deported two weeks ago here we can let him run around a little bit
mi familia ¿dónde está
bien gracias ¿y tú
oh bob hes kind of perfect
hello little fellow how would you like to be a white
look doctor you have to give me something im really sick
what exactly are your symptoms
im like starting to question things that ive done like starting to question the person ive become and i cant sleep at night i i just lay in my cell wondering if ive been a bad father lately and a bad husband and please it really hurts i need some marijuana
sounds like you havent had access to marijuana for a while now reality is setting in
i just need a little medicinal weed and these symptoms will all go away
well maybe they shouldnt go away maybe this is your wake-up call that youve been abusing drugs and need to face all your wrongdoings try to turn your life around
you need to turn your life around clearly you have the addiction problem and im just your whipping boy
thats not going to work mr marsh youre not the president of the united states
ahh poop
well alejandro how are you enjoying being a white so far
mi familia ¿dónde está
bien gracias ¿y tú
yes its good us whites have each other alejandro because i need to tell you something you see now that youre a white life isnt gonna be so easy youre gonna find that a lot of people in this world just dont care about the whites
youll hear about how others in the world are mistreated but nobody will care when you are
being a white is the hardest thing ever
thats my little white oh turn it up honey
and the president of the united states today called the allegations against randy marsh "total buttfucking bullshit" and claims the neighbors who came forward with the evidence video are "tampon-faced 69ing whistleblowers" when asked for clarification the presidents lawyer and treasonous pig rudy giuliani had this to say
ohhh this is just a conspiracy its conspiracy and we need everyone out there who who dont think their voices are heard to make their voices louder
uh hes absolutely right starting tomorrow the whites are gonna start actively trying to stop all this trial nonsense
bob alejandros on your phone and its past phone use time
hey why hes trying to call mexico alejandro the whites do not use mobile devices after 7 pm
why would he try to call long distance to mexico does he just assume that the whites have all the money in the world
the whites dont call long distance
jason never tried to use mobile devices after the cutoff time jason never tried to call long distance
well good job alejandro now youve upset your mother
¡esa no es mi madre
bien gracias ¿y tú
ive had a lot of time to just sit in here and think im starting to realize i have this pattern of behavior where i always want more more weed more drinks more deals with the chinese its never enough see ive always had my flaws but at the end of the day i cared about people you know what the president said he said just deny everything and make yourself the victim yeah well maybe hes part of how i got here maybe the president has brought down my moral meter i dont mean to cast blame - im to blame - but ever since he was elected ive compared my morals to his and no matter how awful i am im never as bad a the president so im okay
help support tegridy farms and randy marsh randy marsh has done nothing wrong stop the ridiculous persecution
exonerate tegridy farms oh yeah just ignore us the whites are used to it
good one honey
daddy alejandro isnt ringing his bell
alejandro theres few enough of us as it is were not gonna stop this trial unless all the whites chip in now ring your bell
¡no quiero estar aquí
its like he doesnt appreciate us bob
oh i know
i mean we give him a place to live food we take care of him
it just he just doesnt seem happy maybe if we got him a little thing to take care of and feed hed understand how much responsibility it is
were so glad you came back mr and mrs white we have even more kids now whose parents have been deported
see one you like alejandro now that youre a white you can pick anyone you want
oh heres a good one four years old parents just deported yesterday hes a panamanian podengo pequeño
do you like him alejandro
we could see how he gets along with the kids
quiero a mi mamá
nunca la vas a ver
oh look i think he likes him
alright alejandro but you have to take care of him and clean up after him
this is a great addition to our family
yeah now there will be more whites to stop those needless hearings
hey marsh you got a visitor
i do
fifteen minutes thats all you get
hello mr marsh my name is mr giuliani ive been sent to try and help you
oh thanks but i think im just gonna plead guilty
oh that sounds like someone whos a little down in the puss the president said you would be and he thought you might need a little something special ssshhhhhh would this make you feel better
oh ohhh
is this just what the doctor ordered
yeahhh
tom im standing outside the government building where randy marsh is about to be arraigned protesters from both sides have gathered here some of them who are for the proceedings
lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up lock him up
and also those in support of ending the investigation
let him go let him go
these hearings are a waste of the taxpayers money
nothing in these hearings will change the whites minds one bit
daddy
what
alejandro isnt putting on his sunscreen
alejandro what have we told you all whites wear sunscreen put it on right now
¡ahhh ¡no necesito protector solar ¡necesito a mi madre y a mi padre
¡bien gracias ¡¿y tú now put it on
¡alto ¡aah ¡alto ¡te odio ¡te odio
in the south park vs tegridy farms matter we are now ready to proceed with the arraignment before doing so mr marsh do you have any words
yeah i have some words to say
go get em go go get em
i cant believe im being attacked here you people are monsters the evidence shows me in a yard taking a dump yes because i was setting a trap for mexican joker thats right and mexican joker attacked seconds later i was trying to protect you people from terrorists and what do i get for it i get a- a bunch of- a bunch of no no i cant do this you wanna know what really happened the president sent me his lawyer and his lawyer told me what to say to get off and gave me a joint in prison
what
and then i smoked that joint and you know what i thought i thought "this is some shitty-ass weed" it wasnt tegridy it barely even changed my mental state the reason i got into the marijuana business was to make quality simple weed that came from the heart weed that was strong and pure somewhere on that journey i lost my way tegridy weed is about community its a sunrise its the smile on a baby but most of all tegridy weed is about family i had forgotten i have a loving wife and son and im not gonna forget them anymore so im not gonna fight this ill do my time and maybe someday ill be back making marijuana thats simple marijuana thats tegridy because when you do the right thing good things happen
its him oh god its him
oh jesus save us
g-give it up mexican joker you dont wanna do this
alejandro get down from there this minute
¡abajo con estados unidos
mr marsh mr marsh mr marsh marsh marsh over here
mr marsh how does it feel to be exonerated
thank you it feels really good to have these charges dropped now we can all get back to the business of trying to heal id like to would you please get the fuck away from me id like to take this opportunity to thank those who have always been by my side supporting me from the very beginning the people who stood by me since day one and gave me hope the whites thanks for having my back mr and mrs white and now everybody if you dont mind ive got a farm to tend to
well gang i guess thats about it huh its been a really good run but looks like the season is over
the season is over
well sure the first snow is falling crops are pretty much dead well whatd you all think huh i think the season was a little better than anyone expected i really wanna thank you guys for a great run and hey we hope you all enjoyed the season too it had a little bit of everything didnt it and hopefully the season finale really brought it all home of course if you havent had a chance to try the season finale yet it is available now for a special price this limited-edition weed made from the very last crop of the season is pricey but worth it
