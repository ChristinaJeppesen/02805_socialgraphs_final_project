okay okay okay so this guy is running for president and he hates immigrants and hes basically an idiot not surprisingly this guy is from a predominantly white town called south park colorado or shit-heads of america incorporated im not sure yeah if this guy is the best their town has to offer can you imagine who he left behind "oh hey im from south park we dont take kindly to respecting human beings" you you think south park has a university "welcome to south park university" "please open your shotguns and slap your wives" "i live in south park and my iqs so low ive gots ta dig for it hey did someone say rape thats the word for clever here in south park"
thats not funny
so not cool how does someone just rip on us like that
i cant believe jimmy fallon hates us jimmy fallon loves everything why would he slam our whole town

ive called you all here because south park has an image problem thanks to mr garrison we are now being referred to as the shit-heads of america one of our more politically sensitive citizens has proposed an idea for this crisis and id like you to hear him out
hello everyone im randy marsh and ive been pc for almost two weeks now you know weve all been making changes to be more socially conscious but have we really done enough the truth is theres something were lacking as a community and its time we all faced it what this town needs is a whole foods it would instantly validate us as a town that cares about stuff
we couldnt get a whole foods to open here
and why not huh we all just dont believe we could get a whole foods because we dont believe in ourselves
where could it even go

im announcing a plan for sodosopa a new urban development that will turn the most rundown and dilapidated part of our town into a quaint center of artisan shops and cafes
lots of cities are dong this the area south of downtown south park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town but now sodosopa is going to bring in the fresh new vibrancy that whole foods cant ignore
well keep the existing structures but add brick walkways and some quaint white lights a plaza in the middle will be a place where young couples can play with their toddlers and it will all be small businesses like artisan cheese shops or noodle houses
oh this is really exciting i thought this area was just gonna stay shitty forever
