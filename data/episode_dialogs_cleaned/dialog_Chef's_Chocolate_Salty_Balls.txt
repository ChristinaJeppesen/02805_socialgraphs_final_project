why do we hold the sundance film festival here phyllis its so painfully crowded
because people from la love to come to a quaint little mountain town for a few days and this gives them an excuse
no this used to be a quaint little mountain town now look at it sushi restaurants upscale clothes stores $25 parking liam neeson i tell you phyllis i think weve tapped this towns resources out we must move the festival to another small mountain town and begin again
thats not a bad idea but where
ching ching cha-ching
whoa
okay children i have some very exciting news for you oo-why dont you tell them mr twig
thats right mr garrison the first annual south park film festival begins today
wow cool
theyre not gonna show that stupid-ass godzilla movie again are they
nono kyle these are independent films
hoohh like independence day that sucked ass too
no dude independent films are those black and white hippie movies theyre always about gay cowboys eating pudding
no theyre not independent films are produced outside the hollywood system theyre movies about all the glitz and glamour of hollywood
byeh sure well you show me one independent film that isnt about gay cowboys eating pudding
once again you have no idea what youre talking about fatass
im not fat i just havent grown into my body yet skinny bitch
(gasp)
eric if you call wendy a bitch one more time im sending you to the principals office
bitch
thats it eric you-
im going
anyway children i want you all to see at least one independent film at the festival and then write a paper about it
the first film showing is called witness to denial and its a sexual exploration piece about two women in love
oh my uncle jimbo has a ton of those movies in his dresser drawer
norma i want to shoot the script next month with demi moore instead
well you can tell spielberg he can kiss my ass
wow look at this johnson traffic jams at every intersection hoards of people pushing their way through the crowd its almost like were a real city
i cant believe i got sent to the principals office because of your stupid girlfriend
shes not my girlfriend
(yeah thats because you vomit on her all the time)
sick kenny
damn dude look at all these people
im late for a screening ill call you from the theater
all this for a bunch of stupid movies
hello there children
hey chef
whatcha doin
children this whole film festival thing has quite lucrative monetary possibilities now im gonna sell some of my famous cookies to these hollywood types and make a mint
what kind of cookies
calm down tubby
theyre little cookies with fudge in the middle and i call them "fudge ems"
i wanna fudge em
i can just see the commercial now "wife got you down boss makin you angry kids yellin atcha well fudge ems"
cool
and ive also got my double chocolate cookies "fudge this"
oh look one of the natives is selling local food wares how quaint
this is why i come to these things to get away from la and become one with the more simple culture
well perhaps youd like to try my low-calorie cookies "go fudge yourself" or my all-natural "i dont really give a flying fudge"
ooh do you have any tofu or steamed celery
huh
i would kill for some cous cous right now
whose goose
uuuuh never mind we brought some food from the natural market in la
cute sign though
stan i have two tickets for the opening film of the festival would you like to come with me
stan nunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tunh hunh tunh tunh tunh tunh tinh teenh
shut up cartman sure dude i mean since we have to write a paper on a film anyway
shell be the death of him kyle mark my words shell be the death of him
if she holds his hand in that theater itll be all over
get em while theyre hot my all new cookies "i just went and fudged your momma"
jesus he sure ran that one into the ground
whens this thing start i hope there are some good previews
stan film festival movies usually dont have previews before them
they what
who are you to judge my womanly soul
the goddess flames that burn in my memory arent dark dare you call them dark
here lies the goddess truth of my body
oh brother
the goddess that cries "freedom"
here is the goddess truth of my womanly being
you are my blossom my flame when we make love its like the sun is right outside the door
then make love to me right now

ky-yle ky-yle
could it be
hooowwwdy ho
mr hankey mr hankey is that you hello
im here live in south park colorado where citizens from los angeles are arriving in droves for the towns first annual film festival this is just a small quiet mountain community where nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens except for the occasional complete destruction of the entire town and so the excitement level is naturally very high right now the townspeople are anxiously awaiting the arrival of some of hollywoods top celebrities
it was him dude i told you it was mr hankey
wait i thought mr hankey only came at christmastime
well im sure it was him
look look here comes somebody
move aside i cant see
ladies and gentlemen tvs fred savage
aawwww
well im sure a real person will show up soon
so how was that movie last night dude
aw dude you dont even wanna know
it had a bunch of gay cowboys eating pudding huh
yeah pretty much
yeah
the theater sucks though they need to get a bigger screen
maybe they should project the movies on cartmans ass
ay
yeah but thatd be like imax
okay thats enough fat-ass jokes for this week
(cartmans ass is so fuckin huge that they could probably show six stupid films on it and still have some room heheheheheh)
okay that does it screw you guys im going home
well
im gonna just give me a minute
this is perfect why didnt we think of it sooner this town still has some charm left not the mess we turned park city into
forgive me for being observant but wont we just end up doing the same thing to this town
yes and the town after and the town after that like termites we will move this film festival from town to town until we have used it up and then move on until every quiet mountain town is like los angeles
why why would we do such a thing
because we have to live in la and if we cant live in quiet simple peaceful mountain towns then nobody will
waitwaitwait zoom in to a close-up of my face when i do that ready then nobody will
thats it
children im glad youre here i want you to check out my new confectioneries i think theyre going to sell right through the roof i call them "chefs salty chocolate balls"

we have contracts you try to pull out now well sue your little town for every penny its got but thanks so much for the hard work
eh but but this doesnt make sense to me marty okay you told me the movie made a lot of money

if you work in the entertainment business and you make money youre a sellout
its all gone to hell children and were all to blame even me

i give you "hollywood in south park"
wait
i brought him i brought him to show you
oh not this again
behold mr hankey
hoooooowwwdy-ho
anyway this new hollywood planet will be the official meeting place for all-
howdy-ho folks im afraid my buddy kyle was right theres not enough room in south park to accommodate a festival
mr poo if you wouldnt mind we cant hear our chairman if you could just turn yourself down youre at about 7 right now we need you at about 3 okay
uh folks please little towns like this simply arent made for friggin films we love havin visitors but golly too many of you is hurtin our ecosystem be-sides folks film festivals shouldnt be about what celebrities are comin or what film is gonna get sold it should be about people gettin together and watchin movies and about people who could never get their movies seen havin a chance to have it watched if only once a good film festival should be something where we all say "gaw lets forget about lawyers and managers and studios and celebrities lets forget all those things for just a while and just watch some new art"
i have had enough of you
nyyaarrrr
no
now as i was saying this shall usher in a whole new decade of film festivals
o-hoho hes dead mr hankeys dead
well it worked once before
hi chef your big chocolate balls are just the trick
what the hell is he doing
i dont know
whoa
oh my god
aaaaahh
oh my god its crap
ohh noo
whoa it smells it smells
come on lets go its coming
im trying damn it
aww aww glup
lets get out of this town
gosh i guess i dont know my own strength
you did it mr hankey you got rid of all the film people
hooray
ooh yeaah now all we have is a town covered in shit this is much better
i couldnt have done it without you kyle
kisses
stan im sorry i dragged you to all those independent films
oh thats okay wendy i forgive you
sometimes i forget that even though a few independent films are great most of them suck ass
yes and ive learned something too
being a sellout is sweet because you make a lot of money and when you have money you dont have to hang out with any poor-ass losers- like you guys screw you guys ima goin home
