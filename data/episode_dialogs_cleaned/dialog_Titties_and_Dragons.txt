aaaaah
he did what he flew down in a parachute and he what
apparently he stopped microsoft from blockading the shipment of ps4s to the mall looks like hes all over the place winning the console wars for sony
because because what because hes cute
cartman hes got everyone on sonys side we cant stop him
but what does he do besides that hes cute
sweetie bill gates is on the phone for you
tell bill gates to suck my ass mom mom dont seriously tell bill gates to suck my ass tell him everythings cool and ill call him in a little bit
this would have never happened if you would have let kenny be a princess in the first place
hes not a princess hes a dude
well unfortunately for us hes now on the other side we are out of options
so what are you saying kyle
i have an idea i dont like it but i think its the only choice we have
tom black friday is finally almost here and as you can see behind me holiday shoppers are really getting antsy people have been waiting out here since midnight on thanksgiving theyre cold theyre starving and theres already been a lot of blood shed over these holiday deals joining me now is rick tellmore whos been out here for six days and your five year old son was eaten is that correct
yes yes thats right we had to eat him we were all sort of starving out here so we drew straws and he drew the shortest one
what is it youre hoping to get when black friday does finally start
a a blu-ray player ninety-six percent off its gonna be about 20 bucks
now some people might say that eating your child is not very christmasy what would you say to them
iiiiate my son for a blu-ray play-erwith a ho ho ho and a jingle jingle jang-lemy son got ate and it tasted good ho ho jingle jingle ho ho ho ho jingle jing-lejingle jingle jang-lejingle jingle jingle ho ho
no doubt christmas is alive and well at the south park mall back to you tom
alright guys heres the deal the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers the kids who want xboxes plan to flank from the left here our best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the malls back entrance here
at red robin
thats right red robin has doors on the inside that go right out into the mall
the key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the red robin before black friday starts
so how do we take over black robin
i have no idea
hey uh excuse me
yes
the uh xbox fighters are here and they say they wanna switch sides
what
go ahead and tell him cartman
alright on behalf of the xbox fighters of zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up okay
haha
shut up craig this is very difficult you guys win alright well all play on playstation 4s we still think xbox is the superior machine but you got too many people on your side and then kenny became a japanese princess
nobody saw that coming
look the truth is we all have a bigger problem now and you know it nobody is going to get anything if we dont work together against those thousands of other shoppers
so better a ps4 than nothing is that it i think well take our chances on our own
we know a way inside the red robin you dont think youre the only ones that thought of it we were going to use the red robin entrance too and we figured out how
red robin can be rented out for wedding parties if we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there
hey that could work
lets do this together dude our only shot at playing any next-gen console is by teaming up if you wanna game on a ps4 then i do too
and you swear youll be okay with that you wont talk about the xbox being better ever again
i swear stan
alright guys looks like we have a wedding to plan

ahh kawaii
sir stan i was hoping i could talk to you about the wedding
yeah sure what about it
i think its best that when the time comes for the mall to open we should stay back a bit from the doors
why
well think about it the first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance its best we let butters and scott malkinson go first while they fight we can simply slip on by
oh okay i guess that makes sense but butters and scott wont be able to get their ps4s
yes thats true but lets face sir stan this is all about you and me getting playstations the rest are simply there to help us get through-
hes lying to you theyre just acting like theyve given up but its a double-bluff
dude dude
theyre gonna betray you at the red robin wedding he got the idea watching game of thrones
dude shut the fuck up
who is that
hes just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because im in his garden all the time
theyre gonna lock you in
god damn it shut up
he talked about it in my garden to like three other people theyre gonna lock you in the red robin and go get all the xboxes thats why he wants you to stay back from the doors
well why dont you just tell the whole world everything huh why dont you tell everyone what prometheus was about while youre at it
did kyle know about this
dude were not gonna betray you come on did you see prometheus i dont think the writers even knew what that was about
did kyle know about this
kyle thought of it stan dude hold on xbox one is fuckin sweet dude youre a fuckin asshole
fuck you get out of my garden
ill shit in your fuckin garden
go fuck yourself
well the wait is over and black friday is finally here
niles lawson is at the scene and its about time niles
thats right tom mall officials have said they are ready and doors will open as soon as their guest of honor cuts the ceremonial red ribbon this years ribbon cutter is of course george r r martin who um doesnt appear to have shown up yet but uhh says he is on his way just like the dragons and zombies in his novels he is on his way
now just hold on a minute well im pretty darned sure the fastest way back to colorado isnt on horseback
that may be true but horses have one quality that is unmatched by any other mode of transportation
whats that awww
okay cool could we set up the two long tables here like facing each other and then another one for the bride and groom back there
uh i heard a rumor may i ask who is it thats getting married
oh uum tom hanks aaand beyoncé
its its real its for real oho my god i love them
yesh kewl
so beyoncé is not with jay-z anymore
well clearly she wouldnt be marrying tom hanks at red robin if she was
uh guys guys not those tables get the good tables this is vip okay
has anyone heard from butters and scott malkinson the fuck are they
cartman cartman i heard that stan somehow found out about our plan
yes he did
well what the hell are you doing this isnt gonna work now
its fine kyle everythings been taken care of stan wont be telling anybody anything ever again
what the hell did you do
what had to be done so that we can play our games on xboxes kyle
no tell me you didnt
hes not allowed to come out of his room so you can talk to him through the door
thanks mrs marsh
and keep it short hes in real trouble he defecated in a nice old mans garden
ok-okay stan stan
huh hello who is that
stan its me
get out of here
dude i know youre pissed at me right now youve gotta understand that i did it because i know in my heart that the xbox is better for all of us
you completely betrayed the last bit of friendship we still had
you werent playing fair dude getting your dad to work part time at the mall wasnt fair
i didnt even know he was working at the mall kyle
you didnt
but you couldnt just ask me because xbox people dont care about the truth they just care about seamless multimedia connectivity
im sorry stan im sorry this whole war has just got us all so screwed up i just want us to be playing call of duty on the right machine
you dont understand im never playing call of duty with you again
stan dont say that
get out of here im done with you mom mom get him out of here get him out
now listen up there are only eight of us now peterson was a great guy and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that now i dont know about you but i am sick and tired of getting to know people here getting invested in their personalities and their back stories and then having them die when those doors open we all stick together if anyone panics it puts us all at risk stay tough rookie
were not gonna make it sir
were gonna make it youve got a newborn little girl who needs her daddy to make it im not going to let you die okay
okay
okay
yes sir yes sir
not one more good person dies on my watch

tom hanks and beyoncé
what oh my god everyone likes tom hanks and beyoncé ive gotta save them
i appreciate what youre trying to do kyle but i have a better idea this isnt our war you guys it never was weve been pitted against each other by two companies for the sake of marketing thats why they want lines around the block because they want a war to promote their products they dont give a crap what kind of friendships they cost you two want a war so bad then you fucking fight
huh sou
then lets finish it you and me
ikimashou
winner take all

happy holidays guys what can i interest ya in
wed like to get xbox ones please
good choice

tom the shopping frenzy is over and it looks like microsofts new xbox one is this years hot item no doubt this will secure its place as the go-to next-gen console black friday is over theres been death violence horrible human behavior and the big winner here decidedly is channel 9 news
the interface is pretty cool see i told you guys its really a its a seamless interface
yes it is
the graphics are definitely like 10% better than the old xbox
yeah thats thats thats pretty nice
you guys wanna p-play outside or something
cartman your side won dude why are you so sad
i just i cant get the image of bill gates bashing that guys head apart out of my eyes
yeah i know what you mean well look guys xbox won the console wars i mean what are we gonna do not play video games
the last two weeks weve been too busy to play video games and look at what we did theres been drama action romance i mean honestly you guys do we need video games to play
yeah youre right you make a point
maybe we started to rely on microsoft and sony so much that we forgot that all we need to play are the simplest things like like this we could just play with this screw video games dude who fuckin needs them
yeah
fuck em
the south park video game coming to stores soon
yeah and if you believe that ive got a big floppy wiener to dangle in your face
