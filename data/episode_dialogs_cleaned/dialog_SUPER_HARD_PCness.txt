alright everyone listen up as you know theres been a lot of bullying and insensitivity at our school to counteract this it is my firm belief that south park elementary is in desperate need of s a strong woman so in looking for a new vice principal we wanted to find a powerful intelligent and independent female to be a role model for us all and with that said id like to introduce our new vice principal strong woman
thank you pc principal alright everyone listen up im the new vice principal of this school my name is strong woman ive already spent a few days here at the school watching and observing and we definitely have things we can all be working on
hey stotch you do not disrespect strong woman by talking when shes talking

oh uh i was just making sure everything was uh-
you really had to grab the mic out of my hand like that

alright everyone listen up as you all know weve been looking for a strong woman to take on the role of vice principal at this school we couldnt be happier with the selection weve made and were sure shell be making our school a better place so with that let me turn over the floor to our new vice principal strong woman
thanks everyone alright listen up i fully appreciate that some of you might be uncomfortable with me being here earlier today i noticed that some faculty werent sure whether to call me "miss woman" or just "strong" if i were a man youd probably address me as vice principal woman so why should it be any different huh we good
uhmkay
so ive been getting to know some of the students here and im definitely hearing a lot of frustration and confusion over issues that all the schools are facing right now i also spent some time observing in the cafeteria and was pretty shocked by the abusive and intolerant language not sure if any of you have noticed but a lot of the girls are eating their lunches out on the playground to avoid being around the toxic environment thats been created its my intention to make the cafeteria pe class is another huge problem at this school the girls gym outfits seem not to have been updated since the 60s we have a lot of work to do here i intend to do it quickly
excuse me uh im sorry but uh is anyone else hearing hootie & the blowfish like very very softly
yeah yeah i hear it
its its coming from over here somewhere
e-excuse me everyone i um i need to get to the restroom sorry ill be right back
therefore what god hath joined together let no man oh
thats it thats it kyle no more no more of them doody jokes no more watching cartoons of people people having go doody and poo-pooing on each others heads its not funny anymore is it kyle
hello there misterr principal is it
thats right im pc principal
hm whats bringing you in today
im uh having this problem with my ears theres like a persistent kind of ahh ringing going on
o-kay can you describe the ringing
its um hootie & the blowfish
youre hearing a song
yeah uh ahem theres a new woman that has joined our faculty her name is strong woman and uh she seems to have set off some kind of device in my ears
so maybe youre having some feelings for her
no that couldnt be it we work in the same place so it would be impossible for me to like her im thinking theres some sort of device in my ears
well i looked and hootie & the blowfish arent in your ears i believe youre hearing them in your mind and your heart
oh dude bro
you may enter
vice principal woman
yes what can i do for you
my names kyle and ive been doing a lot of changing lately i came because i might be able to offer some insight into our problem here
please by all means
you see theres a culture at this school that embraces meanness and i believe now that it comes from a canadian tv show all the boys watch it i did too we all laughed while they farted on innocent peoples heads the thing is i never felt for the person being farted on until now i want to work with you to open peoples eyes because i get it now
you want to blame farts that seems kind of ridiculous doesnt it
what
i mean its a slippery slope when we start pointing the finger at our own shortcomings
but but i thought for sure you would be on my side
kind of sounds like something my mother would say actually
what doh forget it
may i have your attention please mrs broflovski your tampons are available at the front desk mrs broflovski your tampons are available at the front desk thank you
come on weve gotta get out of here
rrrrr
you wanted to see me pc principal
uh yes yes mackey um i just wanted to see how you thought it was going with strong woman
well she seems to be acclimating fine ukay the kids really respect her
do you know uh do you know if strong woman has a boyfriend
what
no-nothing just forget it
are you out of your fuckin mind askin if a coworker is available in todays times
i just wanted to know because shes unavailable then maybe i can get my head off of her alright
oh boy this is bad this is real bad
i dont know how it happened i know its inappropriate and yet i cant stop thinking about her i think im sick
look this is real fucking fire youre dealing with uhkay im gonna get someone down here from hr
hr is that like hootie removal
no human resources the people that come in to make sure everythings kept on the level we gotta get you back on track
is canada a bad influence on the united states a group of young people called "millennials against canada" thinks so and we are joined by their leader kyle broflovski
thanks for having me tom
young man you say canada is to blame for most of our problems
all im saying is that theres a culture that originates from canada which is at least partly to blame for the state of our country now
to respond to this were now joined by the canadian minister of streaming
thanks for having me buddeh
minister how do you answer to these angry millennials
well theyre pissed off because their country sucks so they wanna point the finger at us

oh so you want to censor it
we dont wanna censor it we just wanna get rid of it
uh huh you sound like a jewish mother
oh see thats what im talking about right there that kind of mean degrading canadian trash
now i resent that i find that racist-
canadians should care about the rest of the world
you are a racist fwiend and if you have a problem with canada maybe you should speak to your backwards president
maybe i will
kay go ahead
maybe i know the president
oh sure you do just like all jewish moms cause you dont understand how-
stop calling me that

alright everyone listen up as you know we want to provide a safe work environment for all our employees sometimes feelings do arise and we are tempted by the devil to act upon them so weve been reaching out to human resources division as i think we can all use someone to tell us about what is and isnt considered misconduct she has some great advice for us so please welcome heather conduct go ahead miss conduct

no same here what made you attracted to his work
well its just such a na-natural approach mkay

malright
"this just really makes sense" you know
well malright
mmmmkay
malright
mr president you need to do something about your millennials
what do you want me to do
terrance & phillip are canadas largest export they account for 80% of our gross national product if your citizens mess with them they mess with all of us
look im president of the united states i cant get involved in every petty little protest against a third-world country
third-world country how dare you canada is second-world at least now you listen here mr buddeh either you stop the embargo on the terrance & phillip show or well bring in our own troops to stop it ourselves
are you threatening us you beady-eyed canuck
im simply telling you that canada will do what it must to protect itself
then i guess both our countries better be prepared
and then you know i was-i was looking to get away from the city ive never really been a city person
malright malright i definitely get that malright
i like hikin around bein around in nature mkay
no i agree i agree the citys bad i love hikin too what are some of your favorite places

yes this is millennials against canada
yeah listen this things kind of escalating you people need to call it quits
we cant do that mr president someone has to do whats right
what exactly do you want
what do i want i want a world where laughter doesnt come at someone elses expense where people can live freely without fear of being farted on i want a world where you arent ridiculed for trying to help a world where a nice girl that i liked isnt turned into another eric cartman these canadians are in the way of that world and everything they do and everything they have done needs to be erased from the earth
jeez i got a little chub
lets go everyone to the gymnasium now
