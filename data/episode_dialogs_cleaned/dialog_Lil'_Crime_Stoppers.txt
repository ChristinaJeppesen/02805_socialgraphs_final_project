yes oh hello boys
hello sir south park junior detectives were wondering if you have any crimes to be solved for a dollar
oooo little crime stoppers huh well im afraid i dont have any crimes i need solved right now
awww shit
all right sir well please call us if you need anything
ill do that have fun boys
stupid assholes how come nobody has a crime to solve
yeah maybe starting a detective club isnt such a great idea
its a great idea we just have to keep working at it
oh hello there boys
hello maam were detectives with the south park crime unit do you have any crimes you need solved for a dollar
ohh neighborhood detectives huh well let me thi-oh yes there is something
really
yes two days ago i put a fresh baked cherry pie out on my window sill to cool and later when i went to get it it was gone
my god
have you reported this to any other authorities
noo but i think its a perfect case for you kids
cool well see what we can find maam
were on the case
what have you got marsh
detective mccormick found something interesting
jesus were too late
i think we can piece this case together now
my pie tin oooh but what happened to the pie
well weve all talked it through and weve come up with a theory
well what do you think happened little detectives
you said you set the pie in the window sill where it must have sat for some time but its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody
your husband he wanted that pie badly but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet
slowly the rage built inside his mind "why wont she let me eat that pie why does she always stop me from doing what i wanna do" his only solution became obvious kill her
his plan was to use a hammer
bash bash bash your skull in causing instant death
then to make it impossible for police to identify the body hed use a shovel to remove your head
then saw off the arms and legs
the torso he would dump into the lake
the arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub
and then finally hed be able to eat that pie
but before he could go through with his entire plan he discovered that the pie had already been eaten by your dog
looks like the game is over old man
oh my god what kind of television have you kids been watching
just the news
all right all right you you boys run along now
hey you owe us a dollar lady
fine here just go
wow look you guys our first dollar
were in business
kenny you got the f-a-g on that perp in washington
boys you have a little visitor
is this the south park crime unit
ah oh
yes it is
i lost my dolly
thank you ms secretary that will be all and get us some more cookies and coffee were not paying you to sit on your ass
do you know where your doll is
if i knew where it was it wouldnt be lost
all right sarah come over here now i want you to describe what the doll looks like to our sketch artist kenny
she has curly blonde hair and a wed dress and a turned-up nose and a blue bow in her hair
you got it ken
all right lets see dammit kenny thats not what she said
put that away dude
dont worry maam well find your doll
no sign of forced entry
but the window isnt locked
right so its possible that the thief sat out in that tree he would have watched sarah with her doll possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife the pain gave him sick pleasure
disposing of the doll wouldnt be easy he would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it
were going to need semen samples from everything in this room
all right lets do this by the books mcdonnell give me smears of all the places the doll used to be mitchell run a tap on the phone
hey kid what are you doing

and so you can see children that the womens movement of the late fifties and the early sixties had a profound effect on feminism in america uh boys would it trouble you terribly not to sleep in my class
uh we werent sleeping mr garrison
oh well then maybe you can tell me who was in charge of the feminist movement of the early sixties
a bunch of fat old skanks on their periods
right but who was the fattest oldest skank on her period thats what i thought now pay attention okay children now the biggest skank of all was was an old fat-ass by the name of-
marsh broflovski mccormick cartman in my office
eeagh
looks like that meth lab you took down was the tip of the iceberg they found a paper trail leading all the way to the biggest crime syndicate in colorado
uh oh
the operators apparently run their business out of a sleazy strip joint down in inglewood theyre all cop killers so im sending you in undercover
uh sir di have a lot of homework to do tonight and i was-
what now you listen to me im givin you one last chance youre good cops but you let your emotions get in the way and your little "shoot first ask questions later" technique has no place in this century now you get down to that strip joint and you do it by the books you got it the mayor is on my ass and blablablah
so what did you boys have to say to the lieutenant
nothing he just told us a bunch of stuff
maybe you decided you needed to tell him about our bonus money
no
theyre lying
theyre dead
dude if my mom knew i was in here i would be in super big trouble
(woohoo)
would you like a dance
no thanks

uh its okay we know the owner
oh really lets go see
all right so well have to start havin the mccormicks make our meth again and-
hey gino these kids say they know you

bang bang bang
bang bang bang
(pakew pakew)
kenny it doesnt go "pakew pakew" it goes "bang bang bang"
god damnit those junior detectives and their heroically reckless ways murphy jenkins hopkins get in there
dance anybody like a dance
freeze south park detectives great job boys you found the meth boss
detective murphy jenkins uh what the hell are you doing we had a deal
a deal
thats right were partners in the drug business everything was fine until these "super-cops" joined the force
now weve gotta kill you all
boys down
huh alright guys put your hands together a lot of shootin and killin goin on but be sure to tip your waitress lets hear it for rebecca
christ those junior detectives have no regard for the law
get me a hard line to the phone and i want choppers on the roof
who the hell are you
agent fields fbi
hey im in charge of this investigation
not anymore youre not
but thats not fair
is so is so
sorry detective hopkins we cant let anybody know about our partnership
thats right we split it all fifty-fifty
thats right i think well take a hundred percent now
huhuh yeah sorry gino but in business like this sometimes partnerships need to end
thats right sometimes partnerships need to end well super-cops looks like ill be taking in all the money now im in business alone and that means that the only person i cant trust is myself
it looks like murphy and jenkins got what they deserved if it werent for you boys we would have never cleaned up the department
all right detectives lets get one thing straight i do not agree with your methods youre uncontrolled and youre negligent but by god you get the job done congratulations
thanks
im probably going to regret this but well im promoting you to full detectives therell be lots of action and that big paycheck youve always wanted
i think i have a better idea
