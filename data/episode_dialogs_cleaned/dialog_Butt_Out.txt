according to the letter sir the town has a tobacco company quite near them
yeah that must be it the tobacco companies with their millions of dollars and their slick desks and fancy buildings theyre the ones making music wanna smoke theyre the ones hurting our nations health i will not stand by and see the children of america corrupted by those bastards this is war
you guys maybe we should come clean right now and tell everyone that it wasnt the tobacco companies that made us want to smoke
what
why its perfect if everyones blaming the tobacco companies then nobodys blaming us
yeah whats the problem
well its just that eh this seems like another one of those times when things are gonna get way out of hands you know its been happening a lot lately how about this time we just put a stop to it right now

can i help you
yes my name is rita poon i called about my boys wanting a tour
ah yes mrs poon my names kevin harris and im the vice president of big tobacco
oh hello mr harris
well come on in how about a little history first native americans were the first to cultivate the tobacco plant they smoked it in pipes for medicinal and ceremonial purposes
not if i were around they wouldnt have
excuse me
oh nothing please continue
the first successful commercial crop of tobacco was cultivated in virginia in 1612 within seven years it was one of the countrys largest exports
so tobacco helped to build america
thats right over the next few centuries the tobacco business was so great that many slaves were brought from africa to help work the fields
which means if it werent for tobacco many of our black friends wouldnt be here today
and so for centuries tobacco production flourished nobody was even aware of any dangers back then until in 1965 when congress passed an act forcing all tobacco companies to put the surgeon generals warning on their packages so now everyone knows the dangers of smoking and some people still choose to do it and we believe thats what being an american is all about
that sounds perfectly reasonable
and heres our factory at work
with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey laywe work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey dayso folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey livesand relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
i like to have a cigarette every now and then it makes me fee-l calmer when the day is at an end
and if it gives me cancer when im eighty i dont carewho the hell wants to be ninety anyway
so with a hidey lidey lidey and a hidey lidey laywe work and we make cigarettes all hidey lidey dayso folks can get a breaky from their stressful lidey livesand relaxy with the cigarettes we make all day and night
well i guess thats the end of our tour
oh here boys let me get your picture got it ha you bastards are going down now
what
im not rita poon im rob reiner and youve just been reinered come on boys lets make our escape dont you try and stop us
oh my god
hoh boy that was great kids
those people at the tobacco company all seem really nice
hah you see that they got into your head now you kids can meet some good decent people the folks who work to get smoking banned
this is how we get rid of smokers we go state to state and do things like use bogus studies and make extensive commercials to get the public on our side and force cigarette smokers to stop
wow its like its like smoking brings a lot of people just a little bit of joy and and you get to take that away from them you are so awesome
here you go bob this is mr baffrey he does all our photoshop work now all we have to do is photoshop cigarettes into your hands and bingo when this hits the papers the tobacco company is screwed hahahaha
but dude youre making stuff up
you kids need to understand something okay sometimes lying is okay like when you know whats good for people more than they do
oh my god that is what ive always said i love this guy
mr reiner your bill to have smoking outlawed at bars here didnt pass
what god-damnit what the hell is wrong with people in this state
apparently several people here still believe theres no proof second-hand smoke can kill you
well they want proof all right well give them proof boys i need one of you to act in a commercial for us well shoot it tomorrow
wow a commercial
and you boys decide which one of you will be best for the part all right people weve gotta get moving on the bill to ban smoking in potsdam lets go
god hes just the best mr reiner can i get you a muffin o-or a cold drink perhaps

huh
this is just startin to look like another one of those times where it-its gonna end up with the whole town turning out its a big showdown happening and us havin to talk about what we learned and i say we just stop right now and go play cards or something
(well yep thats what i think)
yeah maybe youre right
so heh gentlemen looks like only one of us gets to be in the commercial huh who will it be gentlemen the game is on
go ahead we dont wanna be in their stupid commercial
huh oh i get it kyle thats your serbian jew double bluff make me think you dont care about being in the commercial so that maybe i wont either ooops didnt work did it kyle
no we really want nothing more to do with these people
sure you dont kyle oh and neither do i oh i know what youre gonna say next youre gonna say "how about none of us show up tomorrow to do it" and then im supposed to agree so that tomorrow you can waltz in all by yourself and do the commercial thats serbian jew double bluff and it aint gonna work on me ha ha ha only one of us can be in the commercial gentlemen the game is on
sorry kyle but im afraid only one of us will be showing up to do the commercial tomorrow hahahaha thought you had me with your serbian jew double bluff didnt you well lets see you try to open this door now hahahahaha haa haa hahahahahaha haa haa haha-
what are you doing
oh hello kyle oh man wait this isnt my house
cartman you go ahead and do the commercial tomorrow but im warning you those anti-smoking people are liars and theyre bullies who will stop at nothing to get what they want and that means theyre dangerous
hahahahahaha nice try kyle lets see you try to get through the door now haa haa hahahahaha
okay eric this is going to be real simple all you gotta do is read the words on the teleprompter here
heh okay
lets see how the tobacco companies deal with this all right roll camera roll the teleprompter and whenever youre ready eric
heh okay okay you know some people say theres no proof that second-hand smoke kills the tobacco companies say theres no proof that second-hand smoke kills ive just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer i guess im the proof the next time you want to believe that second-hand smoke doesnt kill think about me because by the time you see this commercial ill be dead dead
and cut great we got it wrap it up people that was fantastic
uh what what does that mean "ill be dead" hey uh what what was that "dead" part
that was very good eric here eat this cupcake
uh nnno thanks im not hungry
but you are just eat this one cupcake it has sprinkles
im not eating the cupcake
eric do you know what a hero is a hero is somebody who sacrifices himself for the good of others you can be a hero eric all you have to do is eat the cupcake
jesus christ haaaa
hey
what are you doing cartman
theyre going to kill me
whos going to kill you
the anti-smoking people they had me say i died from second-hand smoke and now they want to sacrifice me to make it look real theyll stop at nothing
well get away from us then
yeah dude dont get us killed too
you guys have to help me
no dude get away
please you guys i dont know what to do
stop it cartman go die on your own
if i go you guys go
daaaad
what
anti-smoking people are trying to kill cartman and he wont stay away from us
dont be ridiculous boys the anti-smoking people are kind caring and intelligent your heads have just been corrupted by the lies of the big tobacco companies
hey maybe thats it you guys maybe the tobacco company can help us
help you fatass we werent in the commercial remember
yeah go to the tobacco company yourself
well thats fine i thought you guys were my friends but i guess i was wrong
yeah dude you were totally wrong
(uh huh)
you guys i am seriously gettin pissed off heh now come on were goin to the tobacco company
oh all right
no what we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves even if it means getting grounded
why
because if we go to the tobacco company i know exactly whatll happen theyll take us in and then rob reiner will show up with all the townspeople holding torches or something and therell be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned and change everyones minds - this is all following a formula
so its either deal with all that or be grounded for three weeks
god-damnit
give us the child
we will not
there you see that the tobacco company wont give us the kid and do you know why because they know that if they give us that kid then well kill him and when our commercial goes on the air it will lose them business
yeah yeah thats right
wait a minute what
yeah when we kill the kid people are gonna think its because of second-hand smoke and then these bastards are all gonna make money and they know it
wha- what the hell is wrong with you thats not right
oh god-damnit do i have to explain this again smoking is bad people so if we have to be a little extreme to stop it its okay
no it isnt you fat turd because ive learned something today you just hate- see i knew it
yup
you just hate smoking so you use all your money and power to force others to think like you and thats called fascism you tubby asshole
god-damnit therell be no more smoking
it wasnt the tobacco companies fault that we smoked it was our fault us we should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do
youre right boys mkay
yeah let smokers smoke
yeah
hey mr reiner why dont you butt out
im warning you dont mess with anti-smoking groups
i dont idolize you anymore asshole
my goo my precious goo
so kyle it wasnt the tobacco company that made you wanna smoke
no
well then you are grounded mister
you too eric
aw awww
well i guess we learned our lesson
no we didnt dude no we didnt
