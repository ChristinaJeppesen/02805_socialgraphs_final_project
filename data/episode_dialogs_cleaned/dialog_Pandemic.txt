france japan and the northeastern united states are currently the hardest hit make no mistake this is a pan flute epidemic
a pan-demic
three countries in asia and seven in europe have already asked for our help in getting rid of their peruvian flute bands we will need every resource available to see this through
excuse me but aid other countries
senator
with all due respect we need to be dealing with our own pan flute bands let other countries fend for themselves
you heartless bastard this country was founded on beliefs in freedom and integrity and we will not sit back and do nothing while less fortunate countries are ravaged by peruvian flute bands is that clear as director of homeland security i am taking control of the military until the crisis is contained

the government efforts to stop the peruvian flute band crisis are now in their third day in cities all over the world flute bands have been removed and quarantined but more may still be out there homeland securitys requesting that if you see a peruvian flute band do not approach it mark down the flute bands location and do not under any circumstances buy their cds the flute bands that have been contained are being taken to a quarantined area in miami

dont worry you guys im sure our parents are freaking out right now trying to find us
please mr and mrs tucker our boys were last seen hanging out with your son craig do you have any idea where they couldve gone
no im telling you this isnt like craig at all im really worried
youve checked with the police
nobody know anything its li-its like the boys just vanished
none of the other kids have seen them since a- randy will you put that thing down what is wrong with you our son is missing
hey im worried about him too sharon
well then stop being an idiot and help
maybe the boys all ran away were any of your boys upset about anything
all we know is they were seen hanging out with craig and now theyre gone
thats exactly why i told kyle not to hang around that boy
what is that supposed to mean
to be honest mrs tucker we think craig is bad influence on our boys
now wait just a minute
im just saying that your son has some problems a-
like every kid doesnt have some problems
obviously craig has gotten them into some kind of trouble
oh my god
this is ridiculous
ohhh this is good
thats not ridicul-
sir good news looks like we did it every major city is reporting zero peruvian flute bands we got em all
calm down people we still have work to do we have to take out the place these flute bands came from so they never come again
we dont know where they came from sir we weve been researching but we cant figure it out
well think about it idiot where else would "peruvian" flute bands come from
hmm
the country is in the name
no sir we checked the entire map there isnt a country called peruvian anywhere
not peruvian retards peru its right here
peh-roo
now i want a plan in place to take out peru once and for all
is that really necessary sir it seems a little extreme
yeah
peruvian flute bands will never stop annoying us unless they are stopped at the source
sir youd better come quick one of the pan flute bands was caught trying to escape
see god damn it
the llama brothers tapas and moodscapes
this is a mistake sir we arent really a peruvian flute band
right you just play pan flute music at the mall and sell cds of you with a llama but youre not a peruvian flute band
we we- were just kids you know we we were just trying to make some money
we just wanna go home
(sir please im supposed to get laid for the first time on saturday)
which tourist location were they playing at
an outdoor mall in colorado
look were from colorado we we grew up in the united states
we we speak english
and were white
let me talk to you guys out here well what do you think
i dont know what to make of it sir its like nothing ive ever seen before clearly they are a peruvian flute band and yet they arent they play pan flute music like the others but they talk and act like one of us
i agree theyre obviously some kind of hybrid
a hybrid ah how is that possible
perhaps a peruvian flute band mated with one of our females who knows
well however they came to be theyre about the only piece of good luck weve had
sir
if they are the hybrid were talking about then they could be our way of taking out peru once and for all
do you guys know why nobody else at school likes hanging out with you because youre always doing stuff like this youre always coming up with some stupid idea to do something and then it backfires and then you end up in some foreign country or in outer space or something thats why no one likes hanging out with you guys
youre being extremely negative craig
all right heres the deal maybe you are on our side and maybe you arent but if you help us well get you home
help you how
youre able to walk amongst the peruvian flute bands they see you as one of them we are going to send you to their capital
can we please just go home sir
we still dont know whose side youre on you do this and well know you leave for peru in the morning
no no im not going to peru not peru
kyle calm down
you know i cant go there stan
one of our friends was raped in peru it was very traumatic
you dont have a choice either you go to peru or you get locked up forever with the other flute bands
thompson can you come over here the flute band players wont shut up about something and i cant understand them
¡por favor ¡no podemos ir ¡estamos aquí para proteger a ustedes
sí
sí no podemos ir si protectores
theyre saying something like "you cant send us away we are the protectors"
protectors from what
¡la muerte peluda ¡la muerte peluda
what does that mean
i think he said "the furry death"
¡la muerte peluda ¡la muerte peluda
this is cnn
the last of the peruvian flute bands have successfully been eradicated from every part of the world paul harris is at the shopping promenade and paul pretty nice not having any peruvian flute music there i suspect
really welcome silence tom there hasnt been a peruvian pan flute band in sight for days now and everyone is really enjoying the peace the world can breathe a collective sigh of relief now as we thank the- what the
oh my gohhhd
ohmigod
jesus christ
aaaahhh
theres theres something else here its its not a peruvian flute band its a oh my god what is that thing
paul paul what do you see
its furry its very furry
okay obviously something different has uh shown up a- did he say "furry" okay uh were were experiencing some uh- my god what is that thing aaahhh
all right were about 800 kilometers from peru therell be a truck to take you inside the border where youre briefed on mission specifics
was there ever a moment when you guys first came up with the genius plan to become a peruvian flute band that any of you said "hey you know this plan might backfire" no that never occurred to you because you guys are jerks and you never learn from your mistakes and thats why everyone at school thinks you guys are assholes
thats not true kids at school like us dont they
yeah dude kids at school totally like us craig is just being a dick because were having a tough time right now
im being a dick
yes
you guys took my birthday money got me arrested and sent to miami with no way home except to take down the country of peru and im being a dick
theres no talking to this guy
all right fine craig when we get back home well get you your money back and well never talk to you again hows that
that would be great thank you
this is wrong uh this just doesnt make any sense why would homeland security send us into peru
(because theyre trying to take over the world)
ah i dont know it just feels like theres got to be something else going on here
please i dont know where else to turn the police havent been any help ugheh i think our boys might really be in trouble this time yes yes please check and call me right back thank you randy i swear to god if you dont put that thing away
sharon youre gonna be really glad i have all this footage of the family someday

new reports are coming in from cities all over the world word of massive destruction and death by what ap-pear to be
guinea pigs
yes sir how did you know
you were so close to figuring it all out davis did you know that
sir
i really thought you had me in miami but you just couldnt quite put the pieces together
you you knew this was going to happen
oh this is only the beginning davis and i cant let you interfere sorry my friend but ive worked too hard to make all this happen the pan flute bands are on their way to their deaths the guinea pigs are rising and the only person who could have stopped all this is on his way to the middle of nowhere
