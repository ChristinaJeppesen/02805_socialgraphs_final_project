ill tell you what happened son see theres a bunch of idiots out there who werent happy with what they had they wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didnt even need-- people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying and these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing cause they thought money was endless it goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in america deserves to own a house so we have people having a hard time paying their loans meaning less money coming in and the idiots couldnt see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the economy and they made the economy very angry were all feeling the economys vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money do you understand son
yeah i think i get it
and so why is our economy failing us because the government kept interest rates too low for too long the government took our economy for granted and now we are all here paying the price how long will we sit and watch our economy fall as the people we must
an angel came to me and so i say to you do not listen to the wall street brokers for they are the ones that put us in this situation fat cats with corporate greed they are the ones who knowingly drove us down this pathway of doom our responsibility is
and where has all the money gone it must have gone somewhere the answer is obvious my friends it is the jews covetous jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves hidden all the cash in some secret jew cave that they built probably back in the early 60s it is the jews my friends who are oft
there are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person but the fault lies in all of you you who bought that three hundred thousand dollar house when you only had twenty thousand to put down you who bought that third car even though only two people in your home drive it is time to stop pointing fingers finger pointing gets us nowhere steve we have mocked our economy and now the economy has cast its vengeance upon us all
hes right
this is the first guy to actually make sense

mornin ted
mornin al
well this sucks

my fault
the jews took all the money away and they ha-

well why are we wearin bedsheets and playing with squirrels kyle
not because of the jews butters who told you that
well eric did
just tell us where the cave is kyle
now look the reason were in this situation is because people are being stupid the economy isnt some vengeful being that takes things away from us the economy is just made up of people and people have just lost their faith in it what people really should be doing is spending more spending is fine people should just go out and shop they should buy the things they need for their friends and family
we best speak with the council and tell them a young jew is speaking heresy towards the economy
can i help you
i wanna return this margaritaville
o-kay let me send you into josh
heeey welcome to big orange finance company yeah have a seat you want some carmex

oh yeah no you know what no yeah
what
yeah we cant give you your money back for that yeah no youd have to talk to the people on wall street yeah mmmm
wall street
yeah no see what i do is find americans who want a frozen beverage machine but cant afford one and i hook them up with investors who want to get into the margarita bill payment plan business yeah
so
yeah so the problem is your margaritaville payment plan has been combined with thousands of others into one big margaritaville security yeah no yeah no yeah
the entire town has given over to your ways mr chairman everyone has even stopped using electricity so as to stop paying electrical bills
youve really done an amazing thing mr marsh people have learned to hold on to their money so as not to feel the sting of the economys mighty sword
i am pretty smart yea but i have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan
weve got guards posted at the mall to make sure nobody gets tempted to buy dumb stuff and uh pat sallsman is doin house checks to make sure nobody is ordering anything stupid online
then perhaps soon our economy will return to us
council i bring news of discord a young jew was in the town square speaking blasphemy about the economy
what
he was saying that your ideas are false and the economy is not vengeful he was rallying people to spend more
spend more what mockery is this
relax father maxi what harm can one jew do against our economic recovery movement
i had a dream last night i was in a field and i had grand theft auto chinatown wars right next to me but then the sky went black and grand theft auto chinatown wars just melted in my hand
whats that
scuse me we need to borrow your squirrels
what
now please please
you have sinned
oh jesus im sorry please
whats going on
garrison you have brought your filth to this town for the last time
what did he do
your teacher was caught buying a kitchenaid stand mixer at bed bath & beyond
take that punishment heathen
hey hey stop it stop
move aside kid he must pay for his stand mixer
come on this is ridiculous
whats ridiculous about hucking squirrels at a man who has angered the economy
ju-just have a little compassion huh i mean everyones gone out and bought something stupid its not so bad whichever of you guys has never bought anything frivolous go ahead and huck the next squirrel
oh
scuse me scuse me id like to return this margaritaville please
margaritaville
my dad bought it on a payment plan that was set up by a finance company which got their principal investors from somebody here
oh that makes sense
it does
you see son we lump thousands of these margaritaville installment plans together into margaritaville-based securities then chop those securities up in a way that we could sell them to banks
so i can return it to a bank
nope because a bunch of people like you are defaulting on their margaritavilles so the government had to buy the margaritaville assets from the banks
what
just talk to the treasury department in dc theyre the ones who really understand how all this works oh sell sell sell sell sell sell sell
aargh
listen this is all you need to know the economy is not a supernatural all-knowing entity the economy is just an idea made up by people thousands of years ago the economy is not real and yet it is real nowadays theyll give credit cards to practically anyone who applies for them i applied for this yesterday to prove a point it is an american express platinum card it has no spending limit do not be afraid this is only plastic its just something made up by people truly meaningless until we put our faith in it faith is what makes an economy exist without faith it is only plastic cards and paper money
by all reports the young jew is not letting up he is still going around convincing people to have faith in the economy by shopping
weve done everything we can and yet the economy has not improved worse it has declined poor bart here just lost his job at little caesars pizza our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one jew why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the economy
perhaps he is the economys only son sent to save us
are you retarded stotch the economy is omnipotent which means it can do anything so saying it would be limited to one son is fucking stupid
that is stupid yea and going around telling people to shop is dangerous
well then theres only one option we have to kill the jew
yep i think we gotta kill the jew
i dont know hes got a lot of support it might be hard to even catch this jew
did somebody say "catch a jew" the person youre after might be hard to get but i can bring him to you and all i want in return is grand theft auto chinatown wars for handheld nintendo ds
uhh how can we help you young man
i want to return this margaritaville my dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from wall street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you
ohhh that makes sense
nnnaaargh
no problem we just need to consult the chart we can determine your propertys value and well be done
really thank you
be right back
excellent news sir weve determined the investment value of your margaritaville to be ninety trillion dollars
what
hey whats the matter kyle you seem b-b-bu-bbbummed out
i just have a feeling this might be the last time we get to do this
well dont worry kyle were not gonna let people kill you well keep you hidden forever
i cant just hide my whole life butters and besides i have this strange feeling that one of you is gonna totally betray me
all right whoever is thinkin of betraying kyle that is not cool thats freaking lame dude kyle is trying to get the economy goin again if somebody is thinking of stabbing him in the back youre b-youre being a dick go ahead kyle
whoever it might happen to be im not giving him the opportunity tomorrow im going to do something something ive known i would have to do restore peoples faith
kyle please for fu-fu for for-fu-fucks sake dont do anything drastic
theres no choice anymore guys dont worry about me ive been preparing for this for a while now
nononono excuse me i dont understand how can this stupid thing be worth ninety trillion dollars
what you think its worth more
no dude that doesnt make sense
well you dont get ninety trillion dollars but the chart says thats what its worth
uh oh problem problem again
what is it now
another insurance company is about to go under if they do people could lose millions
okay no problem wed better consult the chart
sirs another insurance company is going under
now determining most prudent move for insurance company
bailout
most prudent move is a bailout
bail out the insurance company
its a miracle
why would someone do this
what is this whats going on
there look its the jew somehow he got a platinum amex with no spending limit
whats he doing
hes paying for everyones debts
hey thanks kid this is really nice of you
but thats impossible why would he do this
so that people will have money to spend
kyle kyle you have to stop this
its okay ma
no-o kyle youll be in debt for the rest of your life please somebody get him to sto-o-op
uh theres about seventeen thousand dollars worth here
heunh
he paid for our debts so we could spend once more
hes dead
no hes just passed out we should get him to bed
for the first time in almost a year the economy in south park has taken a small but noticeable upturn stores and shopping malls are open again as newly debt-free people feel safe to make purchases
wow the new margaritaville with salsa dispenser "just pour your favorite salsa in the top and it comes out the dispenser in the bottom" oh we need this
are we out of the woods yet only time will tell but we must not forget the sacrifice one person made to restore our faith and make us believe in the economy once again the person we must thank every day for his amazing sacrifice barack obama
aww come on
