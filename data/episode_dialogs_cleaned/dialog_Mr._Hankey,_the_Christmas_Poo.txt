oh dude kyles mom is here to ruin christmas
shut up fat boy

ahem okay everybody settle down
mayor we are deeply offended by the nativity scene in front of the capital office church and state are separate
no wrong
whats going on you guys
the whole towns pissed off at each other its really sweet
that isnt all mayor the school play is doing a nativity scene it isnt being sensitive to the jewish community
you are the jewish community
yeah yeah
oh boy super-bitch is at it again
dont call my mom a bitch cartman
mayor the nativity is what christmas is all about if you remove christ you must remove santa and frosty and all of that garbage too
hallelujah
amen
and we must put a stop to the cutting down of christmas trees
raah
give me a break
and im sick and tired of those little flaps on coffee lids if you dont want to spill your coffee you shouldnt be driving with it
yeah yeah
okay people we clearly need to reach a compromise perhaps we need a new icon for christmas
oooo brilliant idea mayor
hey how about mr hankey the christmas poo
ex-cuse me
mr hankey he comes out of the toilet every year and gives presents to everybody who has a lot of fiber in their diet
kyle sshhh
