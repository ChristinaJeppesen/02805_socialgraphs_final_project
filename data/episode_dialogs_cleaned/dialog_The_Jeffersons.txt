you guys i feel kinda bad for that kid
you feel bad for him he has everything a kid could want
mr jefferson just seems like he wants to ''be'' a kid not have one
oh you know what this makes perfect sense a guy moves into south park with a ferris wheel in his back yard and kyle has to see a problem with it '''' mr jefferson is the best thing that's happened to this town in a long time and if you miss this up so help me ''god'' i will rip your balls off with my bare hands with my ''bare hands'' goddamn you ''''

'''' d'huh
i think he's definitely going to jail i just love seeing smug celebrities get their comeuppance
i think it's wrong what the police do to wealthy black men
oh come on mr jefferson you're not one of those who think that the police go around framing rich black people just because they're jealous
yeah because their hearts are full of greed and they have doo-doo in their souls
hey sergeant take a look at this
'''' whatcha got
looks like a new family has just moved into south park one mr jefferson age 50 bought a house there and paid cash he seems to have a lot of money

'''' placing the blood spatter now sir ''''
frakes
placing pubic hair from the raped girl now sir
all right when this jefferson guy shows up arrest him fast and try not to beat him there could be neighbors with video cameras '''' why do we do it harris
sir
why is it that us policemen around the country have such a passion for framing wealthy african-americans with crimes they didn't commit
oh why i guess i never thought about why sir we just do it
twenty-five years i've been on the force i've seen every kind of sick depraved act known to humanity and still when i see a black man walk by who has more money than me i want to vomit my gizzards right in the gutter but why maybe there is no reason maybe there's just a big blue ball out there that's mostly covered with water and we're just goin' along for the ride
stan time to get up for school '''' stan what the- '''' mr jefferson
'''' oh oh we were just having a slumber party
mr jefferson this is highly inappropriate
inappropriate no you're being ignorant they're my friends you see i- i didn't have a childhood so i'm really just a child myself
here everything's okay i want you each to have a hundred dollars ''''
wow i'm gonna go buy that new sport coat i've been wanting ''''

you son of a bitch you told my this guy was african-american
it says right here on the final sheet he is
'''' does that look like a black guy to you
it said on the final sheet
'''' jesus christ monkeyballs we could have made an innocent man go to jail who ''wasn't black'' oh
wuuugh wuugh ohaugh ugh
jesus harris what are we becoming we're supposed to protect the people where have we lost our way
sir it's possible that he ''is'' black even though he doesn't look it
'''' to hell with you i'm never gonna frame an innocent man again unless i ''know'' he's black for sure
all the adults are trying to get us get up to your room blanket and put your mask on we can't go outside anymore

no blanket stop
it's ignorant you're being ignorant
harrison why haven't you called you know how i worry
i'm givin' up maggie i'm quitting the force
quitting the force you
none of it makes sense anymore '''' i don't even know if what we're doing is right the last thirteen hours we've been working on a case trying to get a real scumbag off the streets and when he walked up to the door i could have sworn he was white maybe i can't tell the difference anymore maybe it doesn't matter because it seems like every time we frame a rich black guy he's back out on the streets in no time it's just like oj do you know how hard those cops worked to frame him the tireless hours they put in and then he just gets off because somebody messed up and said the n word out loud too many times i guess i'm just tired i'm just damn tired
'''' not another word of that kind of talk harrison yates '''' believe me i would love nothin' more than to have you quit the force and no longer have to worry about whether or not you're comin' home but i know you framin' rich black men for crimes they didn't commit is in your blood wiping that rich smug smile off their faces is the only thing that puts a smile on yours you're a good cop harrison yates you don't have to question that because i'm here to tell you ''''
and you're a good wife maggie you know me better than i know myself ''''
where're you goin'
think i've got a little more work to do ''''
mr jefferson it's your best friend in the whole wide world eric cartman mr jefferson i came to sleep over tonight remember

i know you live in california i'll pay for your plane ticket
but i'm falling apart i need some more of that cream and the injections i have to look young again
oh i'm melting
all right thanks a lot for helping us dude
yeah sure whatever
you just gotta pretend you're blanket until we can get the real blanket somewhere safe
aren't i too big to be blanket
'''' i don't think mr jefferson pays enough attention to his son to notice come on ''''
blanket you in here
'''' hi guys
shh blanket we're gonna take you away for a little while okay ''''
you are oh thank you thank you thank you
all right dude get in his bed
'''' all right but you guys owe me for this
dude whatever at least you finally get to do something ''''
santa barbara police department this is snetzl
hello this is sergeant yates over at the park county police department in colorado
yes sergeant what can i do for you
well we've been trying to frame this guy who just moved into our town and the fil-o-fax says he moved from your area one martin jefferson
hm no we never had any rich african-americans named jefferson here if we had we would have framed him ourselves
well he doesn't really look that black
yeah i don't uh hold on a second there was one we framed a couple of times but the black bastard was so rich he made bail and disappeared before the trial
you say he disappeared what did you frame him for
we uhhh found some kids that had stayed over at his place and we asked them to lie and make up some false molestation charges
molestation nice
yeah it was a lot of work took years but we were finally able to arrest him then we planted some evidence took embarrassing photos of his penis and threw him in a dirty prison cell with feces on the walls you should have seen him squirm
that's damn fine police work sergeant damn fine
heh yeah but the point is this guy didn't really look black either we had to sneak in while he was asleep and get a dna sample to be sure
'''' jesus christ monkeyballs it must be the same guy
mr jefferson hello
come on blanket we gotta go before your dad sees us
what are you doing with my blanket
come on blanket play with me jeechabee durtah hee ''''
haaaaa
go go ruuun ''''
'''' sutah
haaaaa
'''' wuchatennah jamonah heehee
'''' oh jesus
what the hell is going on you guys
'''' my blanket let's play blanket ''''
nonono wait i'm not blanket
'''' wee he can fly he can fly
aaaah aaaah stop a-
oh my god he killed kenny
you bastard
blanket blanket come play ''''
nooo ''''
'''' come on
run blanket run
'''' ah
'''' dainduh dainduh dainduh
'''' hang on blanket
'''' dugh heehee ja-
'''' freeze jefferson the gig is up you are wanted for child mo-les-tation
'''' no i am sick and tired of people harassing mr jefferson '''' all i've been hearing since mr jefferson moved here are sick lies that he molests children that he's a bad father that he has plastic surgery
it's ignorant
sure maybe mr jefferson's a little different but that's because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood what's wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child
'''' all right let's just say all the bad things said about mr jefferson are lies let's say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didn't commit let's say it's all made up and mr jefferson is just a nice guy who's trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood well that's fine except for that he has children now and when people have children they have to grow up
'''' you're right i've been so obsessed with my childhood that i've forgotten about his i thought having lots of rides and toys was enough but blanket doesn't need a playmate he needs a father and a normal life ''chickuckoo gainuh '' blanket i wanna give away all my money i- i wanna get a normal job and take a shot at raising you in a normal setting
look everybody i'm a normal little boy
'''' well if you're gonna give away all your money then i guess we can drop all those charges no point in putting another poor black man in jail
all right things just might work out
things can always work out as long as we know we have the power to change
''we all have the power to change if we search inside our hearts''''and we start to heal the wounds of all our yesterdays''''and you know it might be hard but all you've got to do is start''''and you can change all of your evil molesting ways''''jejabee durtah hee-hee ooooh jejabee durtah hee-hee jamonah butcha-tamonah chich-cha''
