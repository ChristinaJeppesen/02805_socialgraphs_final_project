hello again everyone my name is michael and im an alcoholic
hi michael
as most of you know i once lost my job and my family because of my drinking but with the help of aa ive been sober for ten years now anyone have anything they wanna tell the groups for starters
my names bill and im an alcoholic
hi bill
hi bill
ive been using the 12-step program for about two months now and and im really turning my life around no more blowing guys on colfax avenue for a pint of vodka for this cowboy
thats great and i understand this is somebodys first aa meeting is that right y-yes you sir stand on up and introduce yourself
um my names randy and i just really like beer
you have to admit youre an alcoholic
but i dont know if im really an alcoholic
then why are you here
because i got a dui and so im required to attend aa meetings for two weeks i was stupid one night and drank too much and then drove a car that was dumb and im not gonna do it again
randy you are powerless to make that decision the only thing that works is the 12-step program step 1 is admitting that you are powerless to control your drinking only then can you move on to the other 12 steps like believing that only a higher power god makes you stop drinking and then turning your life over to that god and humbly asking god to remove your weaknesses
what wait wait hold on i never knew that alcoholics anonymous was a religious thing
well its not religious you just have to admit that there is some kind of god which has power over you and turn your life over to that god and ask him for forgiveness thats the 12-step program not religion
look i i really just need to cut down on my drinking and never drive the car drunk again
you just cant cut down on your drinking randy you need to know something you have a disease
uh a disease
thats right alcoholism is a disease youre sick randy youre very very sick and just like with most diseases you cant cure it yourself and its deadly
oh my god
dad what the hell are you doing
hello stan
dad its the middle of the day i thought you werent going to drink as much anymore
no stan you dont understand i have a disease daddys very sick
what did you go to your aa meeting
yes theyre the ones that told me i thought i could just quite drinking on my own but its an illness son i have to admit that im powerless to this terrible disease
dad youve had enough just stop now
i cant im sick its not fair why did you give me this disease stan stan stan
aww goddammit
stan i need your help
dad what are you doing in grandpas extra wheelchair
gotta try to take it easy from now on son get daddy another beer will ya
no you dont need another beer
i know that but this disease is just eating me up i hate my illness
dad you just need to not drink so much its very simple
i wish it was that simple son but if i dont give myself up to a higher power this disease is going to kill me dead im afraid the only thing that will cure me is a miracle
es un milagro es un milagro
tom im standing in the garden of st peters church in bailey where what some call a miracle is taking place the statue of the virgin mary has started to bleed out its ass the phenomenon was first seen by father harold barnes who saw the blood coming from the virgin marys ass late last night people from all over the state have flocked here to the church to witness the apparent miracle firsthand
well we just heard that this miracle was happening and we wanted to see it for ourselves and come and pray
why do you believe the virgin mary is dripping blood
well it may represent her sorrow over all the bad things going on in the world
why do you believe the virgin mary is dripping blood out her ass as news of the miracle spreads hundreds are expected to show up here at the church hoping to witness the miracle and even cure their diseases
cure cure disease stan
my name is harry and im an alcoholic
hi harry
ive been sober now for five years and i ive learned that drinking ice tea and and getting more involved with my relationship with god is is is way more fun than partying
it it sure is
once i accepted that i was powerless to control my drinking and my life i i put it in gods hands and now these meeting are the most fun thing i do
yeah
ah excuse me whos in charge here
none of us are in charge were all powerless
we sure are thats right uh huh
uh look my dad was here yesterday and you all kind of messed him up by telling him he had a disease
alcoholism is a disease
no it its not and y-you cant just go around saying stuff like that to people like my dad he hes kind of a hypochondriac
it is a disease because its a physical dependency that makes it a disease
no cancer is a disease my dad needs to drink less
he cant quit by himself none of us could he needs divine intervention spirituality
no he just needs a disciprine but thanks to you people my dad now thinks he has a disease that he cant cure himself
young man do you know anything about the 12-step program
yeah and i also know a thing or two about cults i was the leader of one for a while goddammit
the crowd grows larger every hour as the statue of the virgin mary continues to miraculously cry blood out her ass a cardinal mallory has been sent by the vatican to determine whether this is a true miracle or not
right this way cardinal the blood always comes from the same area sometimes a little sometimes a lot
its a miracle
uh kay here we go
dad dad what are you doing
i gotta drive to bailey
dad youre drunk youre not driving a car
no stan you dont understand theres a church in bailey the statue of the virgin mary is bleeding out her ass

sure randy go ahead
im randy and im an alcoholic
hi randy
but i put my faith in a higher power and i havent had a drink for five days now
an update from the bleeding virgin mary statue
oh wait sh sh hold on a second gang
earlier today the new pope pope benedict the 16th himself visited the statue here in bailey to witness the miracle firsthand it was an amazing sight to behold as pope benedict made his way through the throngs of people
right this way your holiness
the pope then examined the statue closely after witnessing the phenomenon firsthand the pope then cleaned himself off and then declared that the bleeding virgin mary statue is not a miracle
what
having investigated closely the pope determined that the blood was not coming from the virgin marys ass but rather from her vagina and the pope said quote "a chick bleeding out her vagina is no miracle chicks bleed out their vaginas all the time" back to you tom
thanks edward thats a very shocking report
that means im not cured i still have the disease bartender i need a drink three shots of mcallen two small bottles of vodka three bottles of beer and some jell-o shooters come on lets go
randy uh what are you doing
you heard what he said the higher power didnt cure me im powerless again
im im im powerless too
yeah me too
get me seven martinis
jack and coke
dad dad stop
im sorry son im off the wagon
dad you dont have to do this you have the power you havent drank since seeing the statue
but the statue wasnt a miracle
yeah the statue wasnt a miracle dad so that means you did it that means you didnt have a drink for five days all on your own
youre right stan if god didnt make me stop drinking then i did maybe maybe i can force myself to never drink again
no
no
dad you like to drink so have a drink once in a while have two if you devote your whole life to completely avoiding something you like then that thing still controls your life and n youve never learned any discipline at all
but maybe im just the kind of person who needs to have it all or nothing
naw all or nothing is easy but learning to drink a little bit responsibly thatsa disciprine disciprine come from within
how did i manage to raise such a smart kid
ive had a great teacher
thanks son
no not you my karate teacher hes really smart
oh well tell you what lets leave the car here walk home and watch the game like to have another beer or two
all right
come on or maybe ill have three beers
thats probably okay if you spread it out
well how about four
i think youre pushing it
how about twenty
thats not disciprine
right right does vodka count
dad
