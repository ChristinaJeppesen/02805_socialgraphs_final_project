as farmers and cultivators of marijuana we have a responsibility to society i know we all respect the crop here and we seek each day to better understand the nuances and legitimacy of its uses
lets go weed wew
but we growers must face a harsh reality– since the legalization of marijuana communities of color black and brown coloradans those most affected by the racist war on drugs have now been locked out of the wealth creation of the industry luckily the public is starting to understand this unfairness– and many people are now talking of boycotting cannabis growers who are only white owned
boycotting what wait what
we are seeing a healthy and dramatic spike in consumers who demand that their marijuana be grown by those who understand the fight for social equity
ugh ahhug–
the bottom line is this– a completely white owned weed business these days just isnt going to survive
guys i wanna have kind of a tough talk with you we dont really have any black friends we dont reach out to the black community shelley you never bring any black dudes over i mean stan your three best friends are all white
theres only one black kid in my whole class
yes that kid token how come you never hang out with him
i do hang out with him
in a group maybe but i dont recall just you and token ever doing anything ive never seen token here at the farm just like the two of you guys why not
i i dont know
randy stop were not racists
wed like to think that wouldnt we but actions speak louder than words gang i guess i guess i just want you to think about it
uh hey token
oh hey stan
uh listen i uh how you doin
fine
um you think your family would wanna come over for dinner out at our farm
its kinda far isnt it
yeah but look token i think maybe you and i should hang out more
what are you talking about
i mean we never just hang out you and me
hey we never hang out just you and me either stan
shut up butters look just will you please just see if your family will come over for dinner it would mean a lot
ok there we go this is a farm fresh hemp salad sourced locally here at tegridy alright come on everybody dig in
thank you so much for having us over this is really nice
weve never been to a marijuana farm before
well you know with our boys starting to become so close– we thought we better get the families together if theyre friends then we need to be friends huh do you mind if i post this check out our friends
randy i hope you didnt invite us here because were black
w-what are you talking about
its just that the past year or so a lot of people have been inviting us over to dinner and then taking pictures of us to show everyone on instagram
oh thats so lame no we really just wanted to get to know you guys better since stan is friends with token you know just out of curiosity– why did you guys name him that
what do you mean
well– i mean its just kind of an odd name isnt it like some people might think you guys naming your son that isnt very cool
people have a problem with tolkiens name
well i mean other people just think its a little i mean come on i mean im– im not calling you guys racist but– why did you name your son that
my husband has always been a huge fan of lord of the rings and the hobbit
i wanted to name my son after my favorite author but she didnt want to name our son jrr so we just named him tolkien
his name is tolkien
yes you know his name is tolkien
i thought your name was "token"
my name is "tolkien"
sorry i dont think its that weird jrr tolkien is one of the most prolific influential writers of our time
holy shit thats what his name means
what did you think his name meant
would you like to see how we grow and process our weed
you see its all about refinement here at tegridy we believe the best weed is untouched from the earth– so we distill it down to its basic essence over there are our clean out vats and up here we have our first stage drying racks oh real quick it all takes about six days from the field to a jar that we can sell so what do you think
its uh very involved
yeah it takes a lot you know– i just had a crazy idea our boys are best friends now why dont you come work for tegridy
randy i have a job im a very successful co-executive of a financial consulting firm
oh my gosh– i was just saying we could really use a co-executive of financial consulting look i would it be okay if if i sent you some of our receipts and you could help us– financial consult
well thats what we do sure
oh my god this is amazing heres to the start of something wonderful would you like some free weed
no
hey stan
dude my head is reeling youre not gonna believe this
not gonna believe what
tokens name isnt token its tolkien
yeah i know its tolkien
no no no no hes named after the guy who wrote the hobbit and stuff
yeah i know jrr tolkien what did you think it was
you knew it was tolkien like the writer
everyone knew it was tolkien
no no no no no no no i distinctly remember cartman wearing a shirt where he spelled it t-o-k-e-n
yeah dude ‘cuz cartmans a fuckin moron
wha– hold on a second
whatsup dog
dude cartman did you know that tolkien is named after jrr tolkien
well yeah i just figured
then why did you spell it "token" without the "l" or the "i"
jrr tolkien has an "l" in it thats gay who did you think tolkien was named after
stan you out here
uh yeah hang on a second tolk-kien just taking a shit
oh okay sorry
oh my god i suck
this is your mornin commute south park looks like we have a bit of slowing heading into town theres like a truck and a couple cars maybe take ya a couple minutes there also if youre heading out of town on the main road theres a– theres like a car there too

what the hell are you doing
taking shit tons of tegridy orders sales are going nuts right now
no– why is my face on a billboard
because we work together
you said you just needed someone to help with accounting
yes but then– you got promoted i was gonna surprise you dont you see how lucrative this can be i mean we make a pretty damn good team in the weed business i mean we are ben and jerry– were ben and jerry youre jerry and im ben
i thought i was jerry
no youre a towel
oh thats even better
i told you before that im not interested in the marijuana business i dont believe in drinking or doing drugs
doing dru– do you remember when bilbo first set out with the dwarves to fight smaug whats the first thing they all did they partied their asses off chip the glasses click the plates thats what bilbo baggins hates and then they certainly had an adventure together didnt they filled with lucrative treasure
you really think we could make a lot of money together
ben and jerry my man ben and fuckin jerry
hey-hey stan the man how ya doin buddy
okay i guess
the nurse said you came here by yourself no parents
i kinda wanted to talk about something in private
oh okay pal what is it
i think i might be horribly racist
well kiddo you dont normally go to a doctors office for feeling racist but tell me what happened
so theres this kid at my school and hes black and his parents named him after the guy that wrote lord of the rings
uh huh tolkien great name
yeah well i-i thought his name was token like– like a black kid thats just there so that like theres a black kid
uh huh and how long have you thought that
the whole time ive thought that the whole time
wow fuck you
huh
you really thought a couple of black people had a child and named him token why would anyone name a black kid token youre a piece of shit
no i was just try–
you were just going along with the dominant culture of the white paradigm thats what you were just– get out of my office you make me sick
im sorry
i dont know whats wrong with some people i wonder if anyone else thought that this kids name was token hmm anybody anyone else just assume his name was token because thats disgusting and you are the problem
doctor
i thought i told you to get out of my office because you seriously make me sick– im gonna shit my fucking pants right now
doctor please i dont want to be like this ill do anything just tell me what to do
oh you wanna change then i suggest you start doing a lot of reading
okay what should i read
and i suggest that when youre reading– you do it from the perspective of a black person
the knight pigwiggen rides on a frisky earwig and sends his love queen mab a bracelet of emmets eyes making an assignation old tom bombadil was a merry fellow bright blue his jacket was and his boots was yellow it is told that in their beginning the dwarves was made by aule in the darkness of middle-earth
black puppy and white puppyplay together in the backyardwhy cant wegetting rough with a brand new chew toyoh boylets all get alongwe all knowthat puppies are the same wherever you gothere are good puppies (mm-hmm)and bad puppieswhen one of them chews a shoe
as the owners of tegridy farms you are accused of plagiarizing a song for your marijuana company how do you plead
not guilty your honor
the complaint says that you asked for the rights to the song "ebony and ivory" but when you were turned down by paul mccartney you copied the song into something similar
not true your honor ive never even heard paul mccartneys version "black puppy white puppy" is a song i wrote by myself on my piano keyboard
black puppy white puppyplaying in the backyard why cant weblack puppy white puppyplaying in the back
guys lately ive been doing a lot of soul searching ive had to ask myself hard questions because for a long time now ive misinterpreted some amazing writing ive done a lot of reading and ive learned why sauron built the black gate of mordor across the path of cirith grogor which led into the enclosed plain of udun ive learned that the mouth of sauron was once a man who commanded the armies of gorgoroth and dismissed aragorns claim as king
i think stans lost his marbles
i firmly believe that everyone would benefit from the school making required reading of these books because if we dont fully know about tolkien then we can make some terrible offensive mistakes in fact did you guys know that our friend tolkien who goes to school here is named after jrr tolkien
yup
yeah i knew that
why else would his name be tolkien if it wasnt for the guy that wrote the books
my point is we need to petition the school to make tolkien required reading to better understand our classmate i think maybe we all havent done enough to make sure than tolkien doesnt feel isolated and left out
guys can i come in now
not yet token just another couple minutes
w-what are you guys talking about
just a couple minutes bro
black puppy bitchblack black puppy bitchwhite puppy bitchblack white puppy bitchblack puppy bitchwhite black puppy bitch
hey guys ive got something really exciting to show you
ohhhh buzzkill
i had this awesome idea last night and i couldnt even sleep i thought it was so cool–
okay what is it
we do an entire line of cannabis based on all the different races of middle earth we do seven different strains in all representing the dwarves the elves even the uruk hai
uhh yeah no
everyone will think were dorks
randy you seem not to care very much about any of my ideas
well youre just– you know youre just not the idea guy
i dont seem to be the anything guy i thought we were ben and jerry
alright look im gonna tell you the truth about ice cream– jerry actually doesnt do shit ben does it all everyone knows that
well i dont want to just be here like some kind of token black person
oh come on im sorry
no i totally get now why you want me around and im not gonna do it
he doesnt even really sound like a black guy you know that
alright everyone listen up we have a special announcement today one of our fourth grade students says hes done a lot of work and has grown as a person and hed like to share his journey with you please welcome stan marsh
sup guys you know ive done a lot of reading lately and id like to announce that the school has allowed me to declare today jrr tolkien appreciation day these books go so much deeper than the hollywood movies and we see its influences everywhere in our modern culture in fact how many of you knew that our classmate tolkien was named after jrr tolkien but you dont know that lord of the rings was an analogy for world war ii did you and ill bet you didnt know that there was originally 19 rings of power that were forged by celebrimbor so theres much we need to understand and so i would like to bring up the man himself come on up here tolkien come on
i actually dont like lord of the rings and i dont like the hobbit just cause my dads into that stuff doesnt mean that i am ive always hated that my name is tolkien but i didnt really have a choice did i so please whatever you do just dont draw any more attention to my name i cant stand any of it its just a bunch of nerdy jive-ass dragon shit

shut up
the story of young stan marsh might seem incredible but the fact is many people suffer from unconscious biases if you or someone you know might have also thought the name tolkien didnt come from jrr tolkien then please call 1-800-i am a giant piece of shit because you are the fucking problem
