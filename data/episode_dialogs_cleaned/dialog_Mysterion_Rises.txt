i am mysterion though only nine years old i dedicate my life to helping people - when im not in school for months now ive been protecting my town from crime but now something has happened that even i cannot fight alone the bp oil company has drilled and caused a spill in the gulf like no other the president of bp apologized
were sorry
but they drilled again and tore open a portal into another dimension
were sorry
creatures from that dimension are now wreaking havoc in the gulf bp tried to solve the problem by drilling on the moon but instead they caused the dark lord cthulhu to emerge
sorry
i have joined forces with other superheroes in my neighborhood to help save the gulf but even the other heroes do not know that unlike them i do have a power a power they will now begin to understand and all will know who and what i truly am
just terrific what you boys are doing
thank you maam
ill take twenty lemon bars you little rascals
a terrific human interest story here tom as america wonders what happened to captain hindsight some colorado kids are being a little "superhuman" themselves they call themselves "coon and friends" and theyve been baking and selling lemon bars to help aid those affected in the gulf crisis
we believe that every little bit helps
their little "super club" consists of seven young heroes
toolshed
the human kite
mysterion
tupperwear
mosquito
timmah
mint berry crrrunch
the boys stated that there used to also be a hero named the coon actually in the group but they let him go because he was being quote "a dick"
mysterion if cartmans gone why are we still calling ourselves coon and friends
because it pisses cartman off beyond belief and i find that extremely funny
passengers waiting for flight 73 to new orleans we thank you for your patience but the conditions in the gulf are still delaying our departure unfortunately weve just been informed that the dark lord cthulhu has shat on the runway at the new orleans airport and well be delayed at least another hour
awwww
come on people some of us need to get to new orleans now yes yes i am the coon
the coon ive heard of that
ya have
i saw on tv that superhero group thats helping with the gulf spill coon and friends
actually im no longer with coon and friends i work on my own now
can i ask you a question
yes of course
do you know mint-berry crunch whats he like
the evil girl villain fought with all her might but the coon was too much for her as people looked on and cheered for the coon he clawed and punched the villains stupid fat face this fight would not be the last the coon fought next stop new orleans
thats almost it superheroes were about out of lemon bars
well then perhaps we should return to our secret base and bake some more
timmah
ill take ten lemon bars
ten yes sir
thats definitely the last of them
youll never stop him you know
stop who
the great one cthulhu he has risen and soon all will be under his rule it has all been foretold in the necronomicon hail cthulhu the darkness of the mythos is finally here oh man these are really good lemon bars
the necronomicon
whats a mythos
i dont know but i think wed better find out
all right superheroes back to our secret base
mint-berry crrunch
what the hell
i knew it cartman tore our base up
not cartman
what do you mean "not cartman" dude
whoever did this to our base was looking for something
dont anybody move so youre the superheroes trying to blackmail me
aw dude its captain hindsight
captain hindsight the hero of the modern age once a reporter for the national news jack brolin always had a knack for hindsight wanting to become the best-known reporter in the country jack tried an experiment to boost his hindsight levels but then a freakish accident occurred when a retroactive spider got into the equipment the reporters hindsight was blasted to superhuman levels for months he was able to use his new powers for good fighting for peace and the american way with his three trusty companions shoulda coulda and woulda but now the hindsight that has saved so many threatens to consume jacks very soul its captaiiin hindsight
i shoulda never mixed vodka and jack daniels i shoulda just gone to bed last night
um dude are you okay
where are the pictures give every copy of the pictures to me now
p-p-please sir w-we dont know what you mean
you got pictures of me having sex with courtney love
uhhh ohhh
chaos why did you take those pictures
but uh but but the coon said if i took the pictures he hed let me go home and and ive missed four days of school now cause ive been-
alright enough whats going on
hindsight that isnt courtney love our former member the coon tricked you
its not courtney love
please sir put down the gun
no what if i put down the gun and realize i shouldnt have
look dude we dont need to play superhero anymore we can just go home
no because i could realize i shoulda killed you all
then do it pull the trigger hindsight if you dont believe us then you dont have a choice pull the trigger you pussy

wuh uh okay if you insist uh see ya kenny
my mom did tell me i had to be home by five i-
i said its fine just go
uh text me later kenny if you wanna like play basketball or somethin
cthulhu cthulhu dude over here hey cthulhu sup yes it is me the coon but dont worry im actually not here to fight you we are not so different cthulhu though i am a superhero and you are a dark god from another dimension perhaps we can work together i know how it feels to want to take over and rule the earth and have everyone else be your slaves i do bro but theres a group of superhumans who are going to stop at nothing to stop you good i have your attention the superhumans i speak of are right now working on plans to destroy you they reside in colorado and they are fucking assholes and they all deserve to be sent into a dark oblivion you can do that right send people into a dark oblivion cause thats what those buttholes deserve no-dude dude colorado is that way where are you going goddammit why dont dark lords fuckin listen
it doesnt matter even if the pictures are fake i cant take it anymore do you have any idea what a curse it is to have perfect 20/20 hindsight as soon as something bad happens i immediately know how it could have been avoided i cant take it anymore
people need you hindsight without you they feel helpless and stupid
well i dont want the power anymore alright
you think your powers a curse let me tell you something about curses buttlicker because theres some superpowers that make yours look like nothing trust me i know
wha- what is your power
i cant die ive experienced death countless times sometimes i see a bright light sometimes i see heaven or hell but eventually no matter what i wake up in my bed wearing my same old clothes and the worst part nobody even remembers me dying i go to school the next day and everyone is just like "oh hey kenny" even if they had seen me get decapitated with their own eyes you wanna whine about curses hindsight youre talking to the wrong fucking cowboy
and now a special announcement from the president of bp and dp
hello im tony hayward the tragic spill in the gulf is a disaster that should have never happened and as head of the oil company responsible i would like to say what should i do should i admit weve made mistakes should i remind you weve done this before what should i do should i find newer and better ways to say im sorry
should i really believe i ruined my legacy what should i do
what should i do
what should i do should i forget about the past and not care about my powers
or should i tell you "i am not a role model"
seriously what should i do
should i accept my role as the villain
maybe i should just disappear
should i not have listened to my technicians who said a spill wouldnt happen theyre my technicians
hindsights a bitch isnt it
should i just apologize to my friends and ask them to take me back tell then that i was being a selfish jerk what should i do
should i get back in the chair remove my powers and just go back to being a simple reporter
should i admit i was wrong ask for everyones forgiveness and go back to my original team nah screw that im just gonna keep bein a fuckin dick
all right superheroes weve got to find out more about this necronomicon thing
right toolshed
here we go "the necronomicon contains an account of the old ones their history and the means for summoning them"
"it is used by cults around the world most notably the cult of cthulhu"
aha thats the cult the creepy man talked about heroes uh you okay mysterion
im fine
ten arrested in south park for cultish activity this is from like ten years ago
so these people have been waiting for cthulhu a long time
hey wait a minute dude mysterion its your parents
uhh what what the fuck i m-i mean uh i mean what the fuck
clyde clyde i told you this morning to take the garbage out clyde do you hear me
okay mom just give me two minutes nag nag nag
convincing a giant creature from another dimension to do what you want is no easy task after days of killing and conquering cthulhu is at rest now is my chance to make a move perhaps last time i was too forceful with the dark god too demanding to get what it wants sometimes a coon must be on the attack and vicious but sometimes a coon must be cuddly and cute time for me to try and manipulate the most evil thing in all the universe whos the sleepy little man my name is the little coon what is your name craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa youre a sleepy man ne cthulhu whos a needs a tummy rub
youre hoggin it all asshole
cause i paid for it you stupid bitch
you paid for it with the money i made washing dishes at the olive garden
i told you to shut up
give to me you prick ah aaaah oh god hes back its that mystery kid again
uh what the hell do you want this time hey look w-we did what you told us w-w-we treat our kids better and we dont beat each other up as much
and we gave our sons allowances and stopped gettin high every night
im not here about that
oh uhuh sss-so now what
ten years ago you were arrested for being in some kind of cult
we were
weve been arrested lots of times mysterio
mysterion what is the cult of cthulhu
oh that thing nooo we werent in that stupid group they just used to offer free beer at their meetings so we would go
what happened at those meetings
trust us we dont remember uh uh i know it sounds hard to believe but we were actually really drunk the entire time
i dont find that hard to believe at all
i swear we havent been back to their meetings ever since even though we always still get invited
these people still meet where
where they always did jim mcelroys house
they used to meet every friday night i think they still do did that really just happen
i dont think so
breaking news here in the gulf tom the dark ancient god cthulhu has called for a press conference the old one told reporters in a statement released this morning that it has extremely exciting news
ladies and gentlemen today we are pleased to announce the successful merger of cthulhu and the coon cthulhus track record for complete dominance and interdimensionary rule is without question and now coupled with the legitimacy and instantly recognizable brand name of the coon we intend to bring change and fight injustice as the all-new coon and friends and anybody else using that name for their benefit is breaking the law oh whats that there is another group using our trademarked name well i guess we have a right to banish them to a dark oblivion dont we
phnglui mglwnafh cthulhu rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn
the old one has awakened a lot of us have waited a long time for this day well for all our south park cthulhu members old and new it is time to par-tay
there must be clubs like this all over the world
we know some of these people theres mr adler from shop class and those two geeky computer guys
oh my god look back row arent those the goth kids
im so freaking stoked that cthulhu is gonna squash all the happy-go-lucky conformists
yeah i just hope he puts an end to the fucking disney channel
dude why would the goth kids worship cthulhu
makes sense unrelenting despair and a thousand years of darkness sounds pretty goth
now let us read from the necronomicon "that is not dead which can eternal lie and with strange aeons"
"even death may die"
"in strange aeons even death may die" what does that mean human kite
im not sure toolshed could it be a riddle mysterion m- mysterion
mysterion is sooo mysterious
a horrific scene of destruction despair and terror here in new orleans and still theres no sign of captain hindsight rumor has it he got sick of it all went back to his chair and removed all his powers
where are you captain hindsight aggh
perhaps he shouldnt have gotten back in that chair
do you think the dark lord cthulhu is gonna make us go to school
no assmunch cthulhu just wants chaos bedlam and madness
good because if i have to go to pe class again i was gonna kill myself who the fn h is that
what does it mean "that is not dead which can eternal lie"
"and with strange aeons even death may die"
what does it mean
it means cthulhu is gonna get rid of all the posers and make everything cool and black and stuff its gonna be like a nine inch nails concert that goes on forever
yeah so go home and put your underwear back inside your pants poser
youre going to tell me everything you know
nobodys stopping cthulhu now all will be sadness life will become death and i will watch the crimson blood leak from your neck
