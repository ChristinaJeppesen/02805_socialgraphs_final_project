michelle our friend stan wants to have auditing
oho good youre going to be so happy
i hope so
its the beginning of a whole new life for you stan see ya afterwards
great so do you have the two hundred and forty dollars perfect were on our way come on over here and ill fill you in on how the church of scientology works you see stan scientology was founded by a great man named l ron hubbard mr hubbard discovered that negative emotions are actually caused by things called "body thetans"
really
yes and being the genius that he was mr hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans this is called an e-meter its the main tool of scientology you just grab a hold of these handles as i talk you through past experiences in your life ill be taking readings here and well be able to determine your thetan levels
thetan levels
come on in the auditing room and ill show you how it works all these people are just like you stan auditing with e-meters to get rid of their negative emotions all right stan i want you to just relax and take hold of the e-meter handles
so this is gonna make me happy
just take a few deep breaths and ill just get a base reading of your thetan levels huh thats thats strange
what
somethin- somethings wrong brian could you come over here a second
yep- oh hey there greg
stan
will you look at his thetan levels
huh well well get another e-meter - this ones obviously broken sorry about this greg
and so we just try to analyze your personality and if it seems like you need some help then you can have an audit counseling for a nominal fee
well that sounds pretty reasonable mkay
mike i need to talk to you
excuse me sir ill be right back are you all right youre sweating
take a look at this
what is it
the e-meter results from the little boy in room d
this this cant be right
we ran the tests four times we used four different e-meters
fax these results to the head office in los angeles the president has to see thus right away go now
the boy is from a small mountain town in colorado sir
sir how can it be that a first timer scores that kind of thetan level he registered ot9 im only ot7 and ive been in the church all my life
ive waited forty-two years for this day
sir
dont you all see what this means there was only one person who ever registered ot9 in the history of our church l ron hubbard said he had lived past lives that when he died his thetan would show itself again our prophet has returned
uh stanley take the garbage out before you go to bed
i took out the garbage yesterday
right now stan
aagh stupid dumb garbage
there he is
thank you for returning
hes wonderful hes wonderful

please understand we just want what is best for your son the reincarnation of l ron hubbard must be taken care of he had many enemies
wasnt l ron hubbard a science-fiction writer
yes but he was also a prophet who knew the secret truth about the nature of life
this is just too much
we want to reveal to stan the great secret of life behind our church the safely-guarded scientology doctrine please your son deserves to be enlightened
stan do you want to hear the great secret doctrine of life behind scientology
sure
all right go ahead and tell him
would you excuse us please this is highly classified church information
aw rats
usually to hear the secret doctrine you have to be in the church for several years stan are you ready to hear the truth
i i guess
you see stan there is a reason for people feeling sad and depressed an alien reason it all began 75 million years ago back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil lord xenu
ho ho ho ho ho ho
xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets and then had those aliens frozen
wa ha ha ha
the frozen alien bodies were loaded onto xenus galactic cruisers which looked like dc-8s except with rocket engines the cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet to earth and dumped them into the volcanoes of hawaii the aliens were no longer frozen they were dead the souls of those aliens however lived on and all floated up towards the sky but the evil lord xenu had prepared for this
wa ha ha ha
xenu didnt want their souls to return and so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky the souls were taken to a huge soul brain-washing facility which xenu had also built on earth there the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material which tricked them into believing a false reality xenu then released the alien souls which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion at the dawn of man the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto they attached themselves to all mankind which still to this day causes all our fears our confusions and our problems l ron hubbard did an amazing thing telling the world this incredible truth now all were asking you to do is pick up where he left off
but i dont know any of this stuff
neither did l ron when he started he said he just closed his eyes and wrote down whatever came to mind you can do the same just let it flow
okay ill try i just wish i could write in my room but tom cruise wont come out of the closet
i know weve sent nicole kidman up there to see if she can help
tom tom its nicole
ah hi nicole
tom dont you think this has gone on long enough its time for you to come out of the closet
im not im not in the closet
yes you are tom and you need to just end this and come out im not gonna think any differently of you katies not gonna think any differently of you you dont need to be in that closet anymore tom
im not in here though

im im not im not in here
yeah yeah
hey stan were gonna go to the movies
i cant im writing a new sacred doctrine for my church
look stan were really getting concerned about this cult that youre getting into
cult scientology isnt a cult kyle ive read all this stuff and its based on fact
dude l ron hubbard was a science-fiction writer he lived on a boat with only young boys and got busted by the feds numerous times
i did not those are rumors put out by people who are afraid because they dont know the secret truth
what secret truth
i cant tell you unless you pay for a few years of audit counseling all i know is that i was depressed before and now i found meaning
i didnt know you were depressed
neither did i but now if you guys cant accept this great thing i belong to then i suppose were no longer friends
stan i just want you to know that i still hate kyle more than you
tom hey tom its john travolta
oh hey john
tom youve gotta come out of the closet oh my god
l ron hubbard doesnt think im a great actor
mm-maybe you took what he said out of context okay s like if you dont come out can i at least come in and talk to you
oh okay but no tricks
no tricks hey its really nice n here
yeah see
i feel really safe oh my god
hello hey come out of there
tom it now appears that john travolta is also in the closet and he refuses to come out here with more details once again is r kelly
i was just standing here tom cruise locked himself in the closet then john travolta come and now john travolta in the closet too please tom cruise and john travolta come out the closet but then i calm myself down and i pull out my gun
oh geez here we go with the gun again
if tom cruise and john travolta dont come out of the closet im gonna cap this bitch
yes yes oh this is great stan
i wrote that um our followers shouldnt fly in dc-8s anymore because theyre too much like xenus evil cruisers
yes of course so wonderful
and i wrote that the evil lord xenu was recently broken out of galactic jail
yes of course
and best of all i wrote that all the scientologists should no longer have to pay money to belong
what
i i realize that to really be a church we cant charge people for help
what are you stupid then how do we make money from those people
well its not about the money its about the message right
wait a minute whoa whoa you dont actually believe this crap do you dummy brainwashed alien souls e-meters and thetan levels those people out there buy that crap and i thought you were smart enough to see what was really going on
but you said that there were-
whats better than telling people a stupid story and having them believe you having them pay you for it stupid
but then why me why do you need me to write something so badly
because if those people all think youre the reincarnation of l ron hubbard then theyll all buy your new writings and you and i together will make three million dollars
three million dollars
thats how the scam works but this is a scam on a global scale do you fucking get me now
yeah yeah i get you
then keep writing l ron your people are waiting
