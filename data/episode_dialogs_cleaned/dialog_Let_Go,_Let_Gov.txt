hey man i was just blowin smoke say what right does the government have reading my private e-mails anyway havent you squares heard of the constitution
yeah weve heard of that weve also heard of the declaration of independence see theres a lot of people out there who think like you people who think their government doesnt have the right to go around poking their noses in the e-mails of its citizens that is until a plane flies into a couple of towers and a little girl loses her life you wanna live in the land of the free and the home of the brave but the brave cant be free if the land isnt home and that land wont be home so long as folks out there wanna take that american flag and shove it so far up your anus that you crap stars and stripes for a week and as youre sittin there on the toilet with the star-spangled montezumas revenge theres one thing i can guarantee you
yeah whats that
you wont care whos checkin your twitter account then
i never thought of it that way

hey phillip pull my finger aaaahahahaha
hello craig how would you like to know the truth
the truth about what
were just goin through the neighborhood an seein if youve accepted the government into your heart
aahhhh no i dont think so
my colleague and i we went to saaah experience at dmv we went to dmv we admit all our shortcomings an sins and uh make a tital wave of peace and serenity with the truth stored inside our heart
okay
you see craig once i came clean with the government i no longer had anything to hide then i found peace have you read any dmv literature
aaaaaaaaaaaahh no
well theres a lot of interesting stuff in here craig theres even some quotes from president obama could you read this part out lout
your local dmv is funded by your tax dollars to be efficient and proficient
yeah whattaya think president obama means when he says that
i have no idea
well we believe that he means the government loves you and it wants to forgive you if you just let the government into your heart
yes sir see i used to be like you i go around sending them nasty e-mails and a nasty texts puttin nasty picture on my nasty facebook but then i realized all these things they live forever because the government keep a file on us so all that live forever up in what they call the clou its a government term if they could put a file in the clou then i wanna make sure i come clean about the bad ones and maybe get those things off my record off the clou because we all live forever in the clou
uh huh did you follow all that craig uh i dont think i really followed all that

what is that voice
some little faggot in my head
hey so um as im going through peoples e-mails and phone calls um how do i know which people to start with
pretty simple everyone has a file people who have a status of "threat" "possible threat" or "person of interest" are the ones we really wanna look at
the more we pay attention to them the bigger their file becomes
really how big is my file
huh
uhh that us uhh yo-you must have a pretty big file on eric cartman all his blogs and e-mails have been watched for quite some time
jarvis what have we got on an "eric cartman" any files on eric cartman
ohhh yeah we tracked him for a little bit but central computer designated his status as "fat and unimportant"
uhh trust me hes not fat and unimportant i think we need to change his status to "ripped and sweet" scuse me excuse me theres a very important threat to national security we need to change eric cartmans status
and thats when i masturbated to game of thrones i know it was wrong to masturbate and i know it was especially wrong to masturbate while on duty
what the why do these people keep coming here
but i am done forever with game of thrones forever
next please
thank you
yaaaaaay
congratulations brother how do you feel

i cant think of anywhere id rather be than at the dmv with all you wonderful people now lets all pledge allegiance i pledge allegiance
to the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
what the hell is going on here this is the dmv there will be no joy here
uh people keep showing up and telling us what they did wrong

shut up sit there and wait and no cell phones or other things that pass time joyously ill put a stop to this
look i am telling you that you are making a huuuge mistake eric cartman is the nsas worst nightmare
not according to the central computer
the central computer is wrong you need to change his status
sorry but if central computer says he is not a threat then we cant do anything
cant do anything youre the nsa
theres 300 million people out there how do you think were able to keep track of every single person in the country how do you think were able to really know whos doing what
i dont know
alright ill show you but this is very top security stuff because if people knew how we did it then everyone would do it then our enemies would do it we cant let our enemies get their hands on this
get their hands on what dude
this is how we know whos a threat and whos not how we know whos sleeping and whos awake how we know that
you think im fat and unimportant now i am eric cartman and ive got news for you this is all being broadcast live on my twitter zeppelin and on alec baldwins new television show via shitter
hi everybody and welcome to my new show on msnbc "free pass with alec baldwin"

you should have taken me out when you had the chance now everyone knows the truth and everyones gonna think im superkewl
eric honey whats the matter
it didnt work mom i infiltrated the nsa and i was a whistleblower and i thought everyone would be super-pissed off at what exposed about the government but nobody cared nobody cares if the government is listening in on everything nobody cares if santa claus is hooked up to a big horrible machiiiine
i know that the nsa is torturing santa sweetie but theyre keeping us safe
well now you just sound like everybody eeeelse
honey its okay
its not gonna be okay because now im a whistleblower and against my conscience im gonna have to hide out in russiaaaa
no you dont have to fly to russia hon
i do toooo
no it will be fine how about i make you some hot tea with lemon and codeine
okaaay i just want hot tea and codeine no lemon
okay hon
hello how would you like to know the truth
the fuck are you talking about butters
its time to let go eric dont you see theres no other way just let the government into your heart
its too late for me butters i have to go to russia and live with the commie dwarfs
its never too late theres a place where you can start over
whats this
your government doesnt listen in on you to punish you your government just wants you to be honest about your mistakes
i can be forgiven
yes
for everything bad ive ever done
yes
and then all i have to do is go back to this place every time i do something wrong and admit it and im forgiven again
thats right
thtas pretty kewl
weve got a new member today eric cartman do you love your country
i do i love my country
do you pledge allegiance to the flag
i pledge it i pledge the fucking allegiance
hallelujah
yaaaaay
do you want us to kick them out of here lar
no no leave them alone its a nice change to see people happy here at the dmv perhaps we here at the dmv can start changing as well perhaps instead of treating people badly we can offer them comfort and hope why the dmv can be a place where people come to get things off their chests confess yes but also be told that theyre worth something in this world and then dmvs everywhere can become a place where people feel safe and when they do something wrong we can offer forgiveness dont you see what this could lead to dont you see what we could become
the dmv was shut down today after rampant allegations of sex with young boys the heads of the dmv were arrested and the director stated quote hey it came with the territory with the dmv shut down americans have been asked to confess all wrongdoings at their nearest post office weve just received word that the us postal service has been shut down due to rampant allegations of sex with young boys it now appears that the only people who can be trusted with confessions and guidance is your local news station wmz news will be back in a young boy
