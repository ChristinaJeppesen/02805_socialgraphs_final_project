pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it i hope you enjoyed my report on the solar system thank you
okay very nice tolkien thank you k kids looks like we only have time for one more speech today so lets have uh eric
thank you mrs garrison my speech is entitled "ginger kids children with red hair light skin and freckles" weve all seen them - on the playground at the store walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs im talking of course about ginger kids aww sick gross ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin red hair and freckles aw nasty yuck this disease is called gingervitus and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls
what
kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured ah sick gross yeck because their skin is so light ginger kids must avoid the sun not unlike vampires
aaaah
thats not true fatass i have red hair and i dont have to avoid the sun
i was getting to that if you will let me some people have red hair but not light skin and freckles these people are called "daywalkers"
oh daywalkers
this is all a bunch of crap
mrs garrison im really havin a difficult time with all these interruptions
kyle let eric give his presentation
its not a presentation its a hate speech people arent creeped out by gingers
i am
kyle if you wanna debate eric you can do so with your paper tomorrow
fine i will
fine in the meantime shut your goddamned daywalker mouth lets see where was i oh yes like vampires the ginger gene is a curse and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time it is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting in conclusion i will leave you with this if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one think again
stupid supremacist asswipe
dude whats the big deal
whats the big deal dont you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to i have to disprove cartmans hateful rumors do you know any red-haired freckled kids
what about the foley family i think theyre all ginger
hello
hey wuh im giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles can i ask you a few questions
sure come on in
mom dad these boys wanna know about us
what heh hello there kids
we came to learn the facts about people with red hair light skin and freckles
oho gingers yes our cute little red-haired rascals
im sorry but i dont understand you both have dark hair and brown eyes
yes weve learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families dna actually the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four and still it happened three times what are the odds
a lot of people carry the ginger gene and dont know if your spouse is also a carrier then your children can turn out like them
each one of thems a blessing
oh yes each one of thems a blessing
huh blesse-blessing full of love
thanks mom and dad
but its its not true they have no souls
no no im sure they do well it was nice meeting you boys weve gotta get dinner started
i just had a couple more questions about-
look boys if you really dont wanna have ginger kids marry an asian woman asians dont carry the recessive gene i know a guy whos marrying a japanese woman very soon for just that reason
and so red hair light skin and freckles are all passed down genetically a childs red hair is not determined by the lack of a soul but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins thank you
okay very nice kyle a little dry and science-y for my taste but there you go all right thats lunch kids well pick up with clydes speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess
that was a very informative speech kyle
thanks butters
informative if you want to die guys dont forget kyle is a daywalker daywalkers are half-gingers themselves make no mistake ginger kids are evil you know who was ginger judas and what did judas do oh he just got jesus killed thats all look im just saying what everyone else already thinks gingers are creepy and one night when youre all sleepin in your room the gingers are gonna getcha theyre gonna getcha
you buying school lunch today
nah my mom packed me a kosher lunch
right this way you cant eat in the cafeteria
how come
ginger kids eat in the hallway
yeah go on beat it re rr-retard
there you see this is what happens when cartman is allowed his right to free speech
thats just wrong dude i wish cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger
hey thats a great idea
(whats a great idea)
can you guys meet me over at cartmans house tonight at around midnight
sure for what
were gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson
okay dude knock him out dude dude okay hes out kyle thats good all right lets do it
eric honey time to get up for school
-ed a fine time to leave me lucille
poopsiekins sweetie what is the- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
im ginger
oh my god eric
help me hellp mee
well all his vital signs are still normal from his outward appearance i would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency
you mean
yes im afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus
and how could i become a ginger now i wasnt born like this
well the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene it mustve stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence
so im gonna stay like this forever
im sorry son ms cartman could i have a word with you ms cartman i know this must be very difficult for you i for one cant stand red-haired freckled kids but you need to understand there is no cure your son will be ginger his whole life you might want to just put him down
oh
agh excuse me doctor but it just so happens my mom loves me no matter what i look like right mom mom
oh ye-yes of coursesweetie
all right but youre gonna have to take certain precautions now its very important that you keep eric out of the sun the sun is his worst enemy
hey dudes whats goin on how is everything with you guys
wow cartman you look different
yes well its interesting you should point that out kyle i went to the doctor yesterday and apparently i suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency
you meanyoure a ginger
actually gingervitus is the medical term
is that an umbrella youre using
yes kyle the suns rays are bad for my skin so i need to be protected when im outside well im glad weve gotten all that out of the way and now we can just go on with our lives as normal
wow thats a little ironic isnt it
what do you mean kyle
well i mean all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one
hm i dont really see the irony in that kyle
thats fine just get it out of the way
dude this is going awesome
maybe hell actually learn a lesson this time
hey clyde tolkien sup jim
what are you doing
im grubbin whats it look like
youre not supposed to be in the cafeteria
huh
you know the rule no ginger kids in the cafeteria
but its me
right and youre a ginger
dude check it out
guys okay look maybe im ginger but im not like other ginger kids im still me inside
sorry if we let one ginger kid in here then the others are gonna start coming
yeah beat it j jackass
we did it guys we finally taught cartman a lesson ill bet that now cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers
i want to thank everyone for showing up today ive called this meeting because i dont know about you but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against just because we have red hair light skin and freckles were thought of as somehow less important and its bullcrap
yeah
kids at school laugh at us doctors call us "genetically inferior" the world needs to know that we are people with feelings and our parents love us for who we are
my dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel
riiight exactly we cant let this go on any longer we should be proud of who we are think about all the great people in history who were ginger people like like uh liiike
ron howard
right ron howard and uh aaaaand
ron howard
right we already had him but right see ginger people go on to do amazing things in society we need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior that we are in fact beautiful totally awesome and super-smart its time for us to take back our pride
yeah
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
red power
we gingers are proud people we are the noble descendants of great americans like ron howard and others we will not be discriminated against any longer for we are a great race
yeah
red power
red power
red power
red power
i dont believe it
red power
should we tell him the truth
red power
nah let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer
red power
red power
better red than dead
better red than dead
better red than dead
tom im standing outside the denver center for the performing arts where the new production of "annie" has just premiered to cries of outrage a rapidly-growing organization called the ginger separatist movement is furious that the lead role of annie is being played by a girl who isnt actually red-haired and freckled joining me now is the gingers head spokesperson eric cartman
thats right this is bullcrap we true gingers are furious that the role of annie is being minimalized
what harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community
the bitch isnt ginger shes just using makeup to look ginger and pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do
yeah thats right
there she is get her die you stupid bitch
this is getting pretty ugly tom these gingers are really riled up if you are a ginger and would like to join the ginger separatist movement you can attend their first meeting this friday in the sunset room at the airport hilton
okay welcome everyone its so great to see such a wonderful turnout at the first all-ginger pride conference now it is my honor to introduce the man who has brought self-respect to gingers eric cartman
thanks jody gingers how are we feelin can i get a red power
red power
oh yeah that feels good doesnt it feels good to be proud of who you are now i dont think i need to tell you theres a lot of hate out there hate for awesome people like us and if theres one thing ive learned is that the only way to fight hate is with more hate we are not the freaks of society everyone else is
yeah
gingers are the chosen people the chosen race and we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife dark-skinned rats that they are
hello there gary nelson with hilton guest relations just making sure you guys have everything you need
were fine thanks
need any buffet items restocked everyone okay on coffee
were fine
great oh and hey guys just wanted to say thanks for choosing the airport hilton for your conference
youre welcome now leave us alone my fellow gingers i envision a world in which there is no hate a world where everyone is ginger and so we must gather together every child who is not ginger and exterminate them
huh
what
ex-terminate
now go go out into the night and take non-ginger kids from their homes we will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in now i am not gonna live my life as a goddamned minority are you with me
huzzah huzzah
dude were gonna go sneak into cartmans and change him back into a non-ginger
huh why
because now hes acting like gingers are awesome and all his friends are gingers when he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isnt really ginger itll be hysterical
(hehe yeah hehe)
are you in
totally
you know cartman is an uncaring bigoted intolerant asshole but i have to admit i had my own prejudice about gingers i think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another and we shouldnt be threatened by those differences i mean cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night
(hehe yeah heh)
oh hey there
you guys need anything
