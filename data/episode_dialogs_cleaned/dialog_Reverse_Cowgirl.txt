of course man its cool
clyde clyde what have i told you about pissing on the seat and clydes all like "ah okay mom fuck not in front of my friends
cartman it was actually really lame
i know right women are just jealous cause they have to sit outwards to pee and crap
wait a minute youre supposed to poop on the toilet facing out but i thought you sit on the toilet this way so that you have that nice little shelf for your comics and chocolate milk well because you got the flusher right here no oh jeez thats embarrassing
clyde clyde there you are
mom
clyde donovan you come home this instant
why
what have i told you about putting the toilet seat down after you go to the bathroom
mom im in class
how many times do i have to tell you clyde i was trying to get ready for work and the toilet seat was up again
betsy come back home its just not that big a deal
no roger its a disgusting habit and im sick and tired of it if i had sat down i would have gotten toilet water all over my vagina
my grandma is from virginia
youre coming home right now and youre putting the seat down where it belongs lets go

dude im telling you it was fucking hysterical clyde had to get up in the middle of class and follow his mom home to put the seat down he was so embarrassed dude i thought he was gonna die
i know fatass i was there
his mom his mom goes "clyde youre an asshole and now i have toilet water in my vagayjay"
thats not what she said youre putting extras on again its not that funny
i know dude the bathroom is the last bastion of american freedom
dont you just feel a little bad for clyde
nuh-uh
well you should the poor guy shouldnt be screamed for something that just isnt that big a deal at all
whats going on
they are trying to save clydes mom
from what
theyre saying clyde left the toilet seat up again
hang it there youre going to be fine okay stay with me now
im sorry theres nothing we can do
what
when she fell into the toilet she also made it flush it created a suction thats literally pulling out her insides
cant we disconnect the toilet from the plumbing
yes well have to but when we do that the change in pressure will rip out her organs
but shes not gonna die is she
why did you leave the toilet seat up son
clyde clyde clyde i want you to know i dont blame you for this we should have been h-h-harder on you all those times you left the toilet seat up
mom im sorry
shhh sh i dont have a lot of time clyde just please put the toilet seat down from now on for your sisters sake please oh god please let me go let me go do it do it do it
mom
ill always remember betsy donovans kind nature more than anything she always treated people with dignity and respect what a tragedy she had to leave us so soon but im sure betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet
id like to say on behalf of the departed that it isnt a womans responsibility to see that the seat is down its a mans responsibility to put it down its not that hard
yeah yes thats right
putting the toilet seat down isnt that hard so is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl
my god people this is a funeral please have some respect theres a little boy here who has lost his mother hell never see her again because he couldnt take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing and now little clydes mother is dead and the blood is on his penis
crap its too bad we didnt find any treasure on the subway phillip
oh hello ugly bob
hello terrance hello phillip
mom get the door
youre looking hideously ugly today ugly bob
how come you guys say stuff like that
because youre goddamn ugly
hello maam were the toilet safety administration

safety belt
federal law requires all toilets to be fitted with a safety harness so that nobody can fall in
dude you cant make me wear a seatbelt to take a dump
this is for your safety a woman died you know
yeah but the bloods on clydes wiener not mine
sir we are really worried about our friend clyde everywhere he goes people are telling him he had blood on his wiener
uh-uh go on
we keep trying to tell him maybe this all isnt his fault maybe the people who made the toilet are to blame for what happened
so we were just wondering if we could sue somebody
you can always sue somebody
all right you see clyde okay we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet
you got it here we go the inventor of the toilet sir thomas harrington in england died in 1692

hey whats that thing
thats a camera its a security camera
aw you people have me on camera now
its okay sir theres just one person viewing the monitors in a discrete location
exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one its time for us to stand together and say we want the government out of our bathrooms
yeah
now listen all we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down if they cant raise or lower theres zero chance of anyone falling in
hey yeah if theres no toilet seats the government cant make toilet seat laws
alright lets do it
no no hold on if the seat cant raise up the men will just pee all over it
no we wont
yeah you will
well sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim but its a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms right
how about we agree to that if men will agree that they will always sit down to urinate
well no you cant make men sit down to pee how could we play sink the boat
yeah how will nelson and i make an x on sleepover nights
what about us loggers hardworking man who like to stand up after they have taken a poo and then turn around and but the poo in half with their urine
well sorry but if we dont want the government treating us like children we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half
but folks been logging round these parts for generations my pappy taught me logging and his pappy before him
yeah i think weve just gotta live with the tsa
oh oohh the spirits of the dead are looking over the subpoena motion for summary judgement on behalf of the plaintiff ah aaaah
whats happening now
our motion has been denied by the judge concentrate boys this specter is like none i have ever encountered i managed to avert liability within injunction against out claim
so what does that mean
well hit him with a class action lawsuit tomorrow well need all your friends and family to sign a petition and kick in 50 bucks each
what
hang in there clyde this is all to make the world a safer place
security breeeach
an embarrassing day for the toilet safety administration shocking outrage ensued after an unknown terrorist managed to get through tsa security with a gun and a baby leaving the toilet seat up the head tsa chief of operations had this to say
shiiiit
meanwhile outraged civilians are claiming theyre finally fed up with the overblown government bureaucracy
what good is the tsa if they arent protecting us why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet
and the toilet seat was up
weve all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity
thats right
now its time for us to take responsibility for ourselves
yeah
it is time for us all to grow up
thats right
it is time for a sue-ance
yeah
wait what what the fuck is a sue-ance
tom im standing outside the south park courthouse where experts have successfully summoned the ghost of toilet inventor sir john harrington now that the spirit has crossed over from the dead lawyers are gonna try and sue him
sir thomas harrington your extreme negligence has cost tax payers millions
no no
you will be sued spirit thy liability is without question appear before this court harrington
never
quick everyone get our all your money
clyde clyde
mom
this lawyer is a fraud he has been swindling you and your friends for your money
fuck me its a ghost
you cant sue the dead clyde putting the toilet seat down is a matter of simple etiquette its common sense clyde
oh boy here we go
dont try and blame mommys death on anything but your failure to something i have asked you time and time again to do its your fault
now hold on a second its not anyones fault i am sick an tired of all this nonsense over my porcelain toilet machine
there he is sir john harrington
quick sue him
you cant sue me youre all using my toilet invention the wrong way when you have to sit and take a sir harrington youre supposed to be facing this way so you can use the little shelf for your books and your quill and your ink
a-ha i told you you should sit on it that way i told you
why would i design it so that when youre finished taking a sir harrington you have to stand up turn around and look down right at your harrington to flush thats gross
well yeah but but if you sit on it that way you have to take your pants all the way off
of course why do you think i designed toilet rooms with a laundry hole
oh thats what that hole is for oh oops
so then so then clydes moms ghost was all like "clyde what have i told you clyde you asshole" and clyde is all like "mom leave me alone im seriously stop please" dude it was a riot
thats not what i said
hah yeah well im just glad that stupid tsa crap is over with i know youve had a tough week clyde but at least your mom didnt die for nothing i mean were kinda right back at the bathroom being the last bastion of american freedom so technically your mom did die for nothing but clyde clyde
