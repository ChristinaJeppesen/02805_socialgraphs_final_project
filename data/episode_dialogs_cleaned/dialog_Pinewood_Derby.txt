thats right this is all of our planet the space cash belongs to all of us
either america shares that space cash with the rest of the world or we will tell the space cops
alright fine look theres plenty of space cash to go around thanks to us our planet is rich son
oh no china we get to keep the ship because we killed the alien you boner oh-oh come on england you got just as much of the space cash as everyone else oh crap its the cops hang on ah hey space officers
looks like the alien criminal did land here after all
oh that- you were talking about that alien oh yeah that one he was here yeah he landed here but we we killed him
and so did you find the missing space cash
nnno space cash no there wasnt any space cash
well maybe someone else on your planet knows where it is
hey ah ah any of you other countries see any space cash
no space cash
no we havent-
no space cash
no
yeah it doesnt look like the space cash was ever here
uh huh guess he must have dropped it off at some other planet
probably
well you folks all take care now just one more thing earthlings uh we had some images done of your planet and it appears that one of your poorer countries - mexico - has built 32 new hospitals and seven water parks in the last four days
oh yeah mexico you know oh oh yeah all of us other countries chipped in and uh gave mexico some aid yeah they really needed some new water parks
uh huh have a good day
hey hey mexico we said no spending the space cash yet what the hell are you doing will some country that speaks spanish yell at mexico please theyre gonna ruin everything
no japan will you listen to me for five seconds if you keep building giant robots the cops are gonna ask questions
well then why can engrand build a nuclear power plant
nobody can build anything
yeah well its not even gonna matter because finland is thinking about telling the space cops the truth
wha finland
we believe the aliens are going to find out sooner or later what we did its best we come clean now
will you just relax finland nobody is gonna find out anything
im sorry but our nation is resolved we cannot live with the guilt anymore
okay okay youre right youre right finland okay youre right can you just let us other countries talk pr-private for a moment
very well
all right you guys weve gotta get rid of finland
yep we gotta take out finrand they gonna squeal
yeah i think we all agree guys
oh dammit
uh hey space officers how can we help you
well were a little puzzled over one of your countries uh finland
whaa-wha-what about it
it appears to have been destroyed
whaaat oh my god not finland
oh no not finland
hey guys finlands dead
oh no no nooo
noo not a finrand
all of finland gone
yeah somebody better break the news to norway they were really close
none of you knew anything about finlands destruction
no i mean odds are they nuked themselves you know suicide
we didnt say anything about nukes
or or whatever they did im sayin
scuse me scuse me everyone i have an announcement to make im giving back my pinewood derby trophy
what
stan
the truth is i dont deserve this trophy cause i cheated on my pinewood derby car i used something not in the approved kit
not in the approved kit
he cheated on the pinewood derby
this trophy isnt mine and so i have to give it back because if im not honest now then ill have to keep this lie going forever and it will just grow and grow
well stan were proud of you for coming clean but it doesnt change the fact that you cheated go to your room son
your son seems to have some pretty inspirational words you sure you earthlings have nothing else to tell us
hey uh do we have anything else to tell the space cops
nope
nope
no changes
nope
no changes
nope
no tell them no
no changes
yeah no weve told you everything space officers
all right thats it then come on out sir it appears to be over
aw shit its baby fark mcgee-zax
my real name is kevern zaksor i am the ambassador to new planet testing
what the hell are they talking about
these are not space cops there is no space jail and space cash is only worth what you as a planet decided it was worth i mean how stupid is your species space jail baby fark mcgee-zax
it was a trick
whenever a civilization discovers warp speed we want to bring them into the federation of planets but first we do the space cash test to see if that species is worthy of joining
needless to say you all failed people of earth since you did not return the space cash your species and your planet is hereby forever blocked off and barred from the rest of the universe goodbye
no heywaitwait no well that sucks
