(no dad these are all for the bike parade)
bike parade you dad is part of the strike you little shit this whole town is suffering because of amazon and youre out worrying about a bike parade
i cant even believe you would say that sharon
randy its time to face it your weed farm idea didnt work you barely sell to two people a day
its the stupid amazon strike i rely on things for marketing sharon a small business needs products for exposure and until those assholes go back to work small businesses are gonna suffer
ex-excuse me could i buy some weed
aw yeah yeah of course
out early today huh
yeah its this stupid amazon strike none of my orders are getting fulfilled and i just need something to take the edge off
yeah tell me about it
hey are you selling weed

youre strikers
well why dont you guys get back to work so we can get our packages
hey fuck you buddy
okay okay hold on uh let me got some more weed huh
its day 5 of the amazon fulfillment center strike nothing has been resolved and there is ever-mounting tension between the striking amazon workers and the people who want their stuff
josh carter is an amazon employee who suffered a horrific workplace accident in order to drum up support for the strike hes recently fedexed himself to washington how are things going josh
theyre going well tom thank you you know what happened to me could happen to any worker at a fulfillment center im speaking to congress here and then heading back to colorado tomorrow via ups
meanwhile amazon says its training new workers to replace the strikers however because the workers previously worked at a mall theyve had no human contact for quite some time
welcome to the fulfillment center im your floor manager stephen stotch being a fulfilled isnt hard uh you just follow a few basic steps you start by getting an order on your fulfillment device uh its order 6503 mrs sandy milner wants a luminart coffee grinder so you send that order to the first available transaction robot okay the robot will locate the grinder and bring it to the packing area now put the coffee grinder in the box to fulfill the order go on put it in
this isnt very fulfilling
sure it is you just gotta get into it okay thats one order down we have 12400 more to go
all right there you go friend thats an ounce of weed and thanks for supportin small business next
hey could you sell me more than an ounce
sorry friend thats the law us simple farmin folk respect the law and each other
no its fine ill just go over to the anderson weed farm and buy more there
well dont buy weed from them their weed sucks
its a long way to drive out here need to make it worth my while
shit this whole amazon strike has more people smoking weed than ever we have to make sure tegridy weed stays ahead of the competition
we need to find a way to get the weed to the people
yeah like a like a delivery service some way so people dont have to drive out here and even see the other weed farms
you know what they got they got these e-scooters nowadays
you mean the things that almost killed us all on halloween yeah i member
what if we use e-scooters to get the weed directly to the customers
oh shit we could have tegridy all over town
what the--
stephen stephen its a miracle
i dont understand
look dad a whole new bicycle ill win the bike parade for sure
you must have gotten our prime membership back
i guess i did the bigwigs promoted me to manager im been training new employees
when did all this stuff arrive
it just came a few hours ago oh stephen you did it
your townspeople are beginning to learn that cooperation is rewarded by fulfillment now theres only one true enemy who stands in our way tonight hes giving a talk on marxist theory
how is the common worker kept submissive by the institutions and the ideology of the bourgeoisie we only ask for compassion for a fair share of the fruits of our labors
yeah its this saturday everyones gonna watch you girls should come check it out yeah its gonna be a pretty nice bike parade i suppose
hey larry you gettin excited for the bike parade yeah i guess im lookin forward to it

our bikes arent so bad

kyles right i already bragged to everyone we were gonna beat them like bitches at the bike parade were gonna look like total douchebags
i thought the four of us were unstoppable
we are its just kenny fucked us again
i wish there never was a bike parade
yeah hey what if there wasnt
what
what if the bike parade got cancelled were never gonna win the bike parade but if we get cancelled then everybody loses
how do we get the bike parade cancelled
how do you get anything cancelled you bitch about it being insensitive
hey yeah we can go to the mayor and force her to cancel it
whats offensive about a bike parade
"whats offensive about a bike parade" kyle you small-minded piece of shit we should cancel you just for saying that
oh i get it
yeah
yeah
everybody loses you guys
do you know who i am
yeah youre jeff bezos
and you are josh former amazon employee who suffered a workplace accident you were wrongly packaged into a box and now if anyone tries to open it your insides will burst apart so you seek revenge
this isnt about revenge bezos its about the production of too many useful things resulting in too many useless people
see how the box ridicules commercialism in order to try and feel better about itself
damn you you made everything nice and convenient didnt you bezos but humans are more than consumers
thats very eloquent for a box-- a box that is the last thing standing in the way of real economic progress for this town
what are you gonna do to me
im not going to do anything to you alexa go ahead sent them in
okay
hello children uncle jeff has a surprise for you who wants a special present for the bike parade
me me me me me me me me me me me me
oh my god
whoever opens the box gets whats inside
no no dont give in to your consumerism kids no
its mine its mine i got it i get it
heheh
every year i win the bike parade its the one thing i care about now theres kids out there who have better bikes than me because you wont get off your ass and work dad
larry i want to but id be a no-good traitor cant you understand
all i understand is that you suck
where are you going
sons right picket line or not im gonna cross it right now
hello sir i have your weed delivery
oh my weed forgot i ordered that
oh hey listen we have an app now you can keep track of your orders and get your tegridy delivered even faster oop theres an order now
first thing weve gotta do to get the bike parade cancelled is raise awareness
yeah were gonna need poster boards markers and lots of glitter and glue
i cant believe kenny bailed on us just because he thinks jeff bezos is a bad guy
yeah how can somebody who gives you whatever you want be a bad guy its locked
theyre closed were all closed our coffee shop -- everything
but were outraged about something we need glitter and glue
yeah well when the amazon fulfillment center opened everything else went out of business
i let it happen i thought the fulfillment center would be nothing but great for the town instead its its buried us
but its christmas its christmas and weve no presents no decorations and theres no one who can help us
look
ho ho ho ho
its santa
its a miracle
i heard some people here might need a little christmas magic
we sure do santa
its only a couple of weeks until christmas and we dont have any presents
well thats no problem for the hometown of my favorite holiday poo where is mr hankey where is that old bundle of christmas cheer
we we had to get rid of mr hankey
got rid of him
uh mr hankey did somethin bad and we were forced to make him uh leave forever
jesus what did he do fuck a kid
no he um he tweeted some uh inappropriate things
"he tweeted some inappropriate things" oh you bunch of fuckin- im getting back in my sleigh now
nononono wait wait wait please
merry christmas have fun sucking jeff bezos dick you bunch of cunts
christ the savior is born
continuing with non-stop holiday music heres a song from that hot new group the pc babies its a song about how the idea of mrs claus perpetuates female stereotypes its called "jingle all the waahhhh"
hey dad i dont need anything more i mean if i dont win that bike parade i dont care i have you guys and thats more important than a bike parade will ever be
no it isnt butters i want to quit working for amazon i want to quit working for amazon i want to join my friends in striking but i know that you have to have your stuff to be happy
no i dont dad
you need your amazon prime shows and your music and your books and your things delivered to your door like little presents to yourself that make you feel satisfied i can live without those things but you cant thats why im gonna continue working at amazon for you
hello sir im with the tegridy weed company were just makin sure folks are aware of our new rewards program
what
we now have three levels of membership for our weed theres tegridy tegridy plus and tegridy elite but you dont want to be elite cause elites got no tegridy
its just such bullcrap you guys
such bullcrap
how come everything out there is getting cancelled but when it comes to us we just cant do it
i mean are we supposed to just keep going just go on making total asses of ourselves
no no the problem is that when it comes to outrage your average person actually doesnt give a shit unless it has something to do with them
thats right weve been selfish we cant get the parade cancelled for us we have to do it for all the other people who want it cancelled but their voices arent being heard
yeah what did we think this was a fucking joke the bike parade is offensive and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone
come on im actually pissed off now
mayor we demand you cancel this bike parade
it is nihilistic and out of touch with progressive thinking
whats the matter afraid you wouldnt win
its him
the bike parade was quite useful to me you see people will do anything to have fulfillment they finally realized the only way to get it would be to all work for the fulfillment center
who would use the bike parade like some $20 hooker
kenny was right about you youre a bad guy
oh you mean your little socialist friend yes hes starting to rattle his sword now too alexa kill kenny
okay ill kill kenny for you
no
why are you doing this
dont you see im trying to help before there was war between classes customers and workers at odds all ive done is create the new class the consumer-worker the future right now your parents your teachers everyone you know are showing up to work at the fulfillment center and im afraid you are all going to lose the bike parade
bezos bezos
bezos bezos bezos
hello bezos you can take your fulfillment center and fulfill it right up your ass see theres one thing you didnt count on and thats tegridy just look in the eyes of these people everyone has tegridy now tegridy that you will never understand we arent just different classes of people anymore we are a town
are you all high
no no
why do you ask that
because im over here
oh hang on hold on okay i got it anyways you see tegridy is something that cant be understood by big corporations oh theyll try to package tegridy but only i can really package tegridy i got more money now cause of tegridy and thats cause i figured out how to get tegridy to everyone and thats- now everyone is in their state of tegridy thats impenetrable am i making sense
no
the point is nobodys comin to work for you so you can take your whole plan and fulfill it somewhere else
damn you tegridy
ice-cold beer down-home dayscountry music and bike paradeswe got tegridy all around (round round)thats life livin in our colorado town
i guess they are offensive
we dont need nothing from big corporationswe dont need progress or fancy educationsmaybe our tegridy keepw us down (down down)but thats life livin in our colorado town
hey mom hi dad
