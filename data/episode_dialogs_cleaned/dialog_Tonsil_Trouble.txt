ahhhhhh
well theres no doubt about it those tonsils need to come out
what
uh what exactly does that entail doctor
its a very simple operation well just put you to sleep eric and when you wake up youll be tonsil-free
no- no way im not going to the hospital mom
oh i thought you were a tough kid youre not scared of hospitals are you
no im not scared i just- i dont want my tonsils out thats all
well then i guess you dont want all the ice cream you get after the surgery either
ice cream
itd be a shame to have to give all that free ice cream to the big boys who arent scared of hospitals
what do you say champ think you can tough it out
wellyou did say free ice cream
poopsiekins wake up wake up honey
uh its over
thats right you did it poopsiekins
its over i didnt feel anything you were right mom
im so proud of you eric
all right so wheres my ice cream
oh heres the doctors now hi doctor
you were right doctor everything is okay
no its not eric im afraid that weve accidentally infected you with the aids virus
what
whats that supposed to mean
during the tonsil surgery we had to supply you with donor blood a mistake was made and you were given blood contaminated with hiv it was a one in a billion fluke
i have aids
not yet but weve confirmed that you now have the virus that causes aids we are very sorry
"sorry" you gave me aids and youre "sorry"
oh my poor little baby
mom you said nothing would go wrong
oh god oh no
no no this is a joke right this is a joke i cant have aids
were going to do everything in our power to make this up to you eric for starters i think i owe you some ice cream
fuck your ice cream you said id be fine you all said id be fine
oh oh my baby has hiv
no noooooooo
thank you for coming everyone
boys please take a seat
whats going on are we in trouble
boys the reason we called you all in is because one of your friends has a serious illness eric cartman has been diagnosed with hiv
what
oh no
hes been to several specialists after a botched blood transfusion the disease is in very early stages and completely manageable but hes naturally a bit scared
cartman has hiv
we need everyone to understand you cant get the virus from eric you can still give him hugs and even kisses dont be afraid of him just-
excuse me eric cartman has hiv
all right were going to bring eric in now and lets all be as supportive as we can and show him lots of love okay
eric come on in your friends want to say "hi" mkay
no way
how ya doin eric you know i think youre a real special little guy and even though you have aids i aint gonna act any different towards you
god damn it this sucks ass
excuse me i have to step out for a minute
poor kyle hes really taking it hard
is kyle laughing out there this isnt a time for funny jokes im gonna die
no youre not going to die eric aids isnt as big a deal as it used to be there are advances in treatment and-
not a big deal is that how everyone feels people need to understand the seriousness of this illness and the bravery of the people who struggle with it
we are here tonight to salute the bravery and the courage of one very special little boy who is living with hiv
where the hell is everybody
excuse me shouldnt we wait for everyone to arrive before we get started
this is everyone we didnt sell that many tickets
great benefit eric
the italian meatballs are fa-fantastic
so this is it
im afraid aids benefits arent as popular as they used to be aids was more the 80s/90s disease its all about cancer now
well thats just great of all the times to get aids i get it right when everyone stops givin a crap
with all of your help we have raised over seventeen dollars for aids tonight and that money will certainly go towards helping little eric markman
just bring out elton john already
uh were sorry elton couldnt make it he- uh he had to play at a cancer benefit
its all right we got somebody better jimmy buffett
jimmy buffett
hello everyone i wrote this song for a very brave little boyaidsburger in paradiseaidsburger and it aint nice

he does feel bad for you cartman he just thinks its ironic
ironic how
well you know youre always such a dick and stuff and and now
oh and what i deserve it is that what you think

nobody deserves this illness stan kenny nobody its awful and maybe somebody needs to teach kyle how to have some compassion
oh uh-okay its clear
all right get that rope ready to hoist me up
okay but what are you going to do
kyle thinks that hiv is funny so were gonna make him look funny and then hell know how it feels to be laughed at
i just uh well i dont know if i should be helping you make kyle look silly
butters helping people who have aids is one of the most important things you can do
i know but are you sure kyle has to be taught a lesson
im not just sure butters im hiv-positive
oh yeah uh-well i guess thats true
all right now get the rope up over that third rafter above the window thats the easiest access
wow you really know what youre doing
yeah ive sneaked into kyles room lots of times you think hiv is something to be laughed at kyle well lets just see how funny it is now asshole

what hope
break my xbox and youll never know
youre lying
no no-al- all right kyle magic johnson kyle the key is magic johnson
magic johnson
he was a basketball player
so what
so he got hiv like fifty years ago and hes still totally fine magic johnson has some kind of resistance to the virus kyle ive been researching it since i got infected if we can track him down and isolate his genetic prototype we have a chance of beating this thing buddy you and me kyle we can overcome our illness i swear it to you
you better cause if you dont find a cure for hiv i will break your xbox
my god
we need two tickets to los angeles as soon as possible
los angeles okay uh i have a two oclock flight that would beee $400 each
ah sir you dont understand we have to see magic johnson right away you see we have aids
aids wow thats really retro but ah im sorry i- i just cant give away free seats
dont you get it we are two pals afflicted with an illness and who only have each other in a race against time innocent playful children who are stricken with a deadly disease for no reason
oh please no reason i got aids from him
oh you boys are like that huh
no
are you sure you boys just dont have any cash
were not just sure were hiv-positive
uh we sometimes offer free seats to cancer patients but aids i d- heh-hey mitch do we have any aids patient policies
forget it all right well use another airline one that cares
were so happy to help accommodate you brave boys what kind of cancer did you say you have again
oh uh you know all over cancer
im so sorry
yeah well at least its not as bad as having aids aids is the worst disease
hm i dont know these days i think id rather have aids than cancer
no you wouldnt look shouldnt you be serving people drinks or something get outta here were on our way buddy magic johnson here we come
dont touch me
i know im scared too
magic magic could you come to the front for a minute there are a couple of boys here to see you two brave little buddies who against all odds have journeyed across america to find the cure for aids all they have are each other in a race against time
thank you for seeing us mr johnson we were hoping that maybe you have some kind of key that can help us with our disease
you boys both have the virus are you sure
were not just sure were hiv-positive
will you stop it with that what part of this is funny to you
kyle we need to try to find a-
what part of being infected with a deadly disease do you find funny
i dont think its funny kyle
then stop saying youre not just sure youre hiv positive this isnt funny aids isnt funny dying isnt funny so shut the fuck up
well excuse me kyle for trying to keep some optimism you know i mean sometimes when things seem their darkest you just need to try and stay hiv-positive but if you wanna be so hiv-negative all the time i-
knock it off right now this isnt funny at all
are you sure
yes
are you hiv-positive aarrhh ow fuck kyle
boys the truth is i dont know why my body is so resistant to the virus i would love to know so i could help others but i just dont
well ive been thinking maybe theres something youve come into contact with that hinders hiv from growing do you mind if we just look around
well not at all
the pool is over there where i try to swim and stay in shape my kitchen is full of pretty healthy food i dont know which thing it is that keeps my t-cell count high so i try it all
but everyone tries that there has to be something youre exposed to that others arent could we see where you sleep
sure
just a pretty plain old ordinary bedroom
dude
oh oh yeah i- i dont trust banks i sleep with all my money
you sleep with money every night
yeah i like to keep it close b- you dont think that
its incredible mitch these boys could be onto something take a look thats a sample of hiv-infected blood you can clearly see the hiv attacking the white blood cells right all right watch what happens when we introduce some cash
my god the hiv particles are receding
the cash does seem to retrain the hiv cells from stabilizing
now hold on all the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus not destroying it
well look if being around lots of cash negatively affects the hiv then maybe
then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether
i have enough cash for all three of us we should give it a try
na-noo its ridiculous we need fda approval control studies im sorry but this is impossible
these boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives
their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world thats for sure
wugh
i suppose we could try to distill magics cash down to its most highly-concentrated level and try it on one of them but its very risky
yeah well if theres a chance of being cured of this illness then kyle is willing to take that risk
lets hope to christ this works
wait a minute yes yes take a look the cash particles have completely replaced all the hiv in kyles blood boys you just found the cure for aids
all right
they found the cure for aids the cure for aids
what is it
large doses of concentrated cash get the media on the phone
all right
scientists have just discovered the cure for aids about a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream
hey they just found the cure for aids you just have to inject yourself with all your cash woohoo
i am pleased to announce that there is no trace of the hiv virus in either kyle broflovski or eric cartman together these boys beat their illness with nothing but each other and overcoming all odds these two brave friends-
oh stop were not friends hes the one who infected me with aids
these two brave lovers found the cure and helped the world and so to honor these boys here is jimmy buffett
what aw no
cureburger in paradisecureburger there i said it twice
what aw god damn it well ill tell you this kyle im never gettin my tonsils out again hahahaha
im still breaking your xbox
what no no kyle no
