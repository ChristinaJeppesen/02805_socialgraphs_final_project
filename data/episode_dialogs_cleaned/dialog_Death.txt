well i didnt have her do it she did it on her own
why does this happen every month it seems like right around the same time every month kyles mom gets a hair up her ass about something and i always end up getting screwed by it
children children a certain students mother called me last night
oh gee i wonder whos mother that could have been
she informed me that some of you might be watching a a naughty show called terrance & phillip
yeahh woohoo
watching that show is bad mr garrison
thats right mr hat shows like terrance & phillip are what we call toilet humor they dont expand your minds
you see children these kind of shows are senseless vile trash
kenny why are you late to class
oh okay kenny be seated

yes kenny what is it
(i have to go poop)
i thought you just came from the bathroom
(i did i gotta go again)
okay okay go ahead
as i was saying you all seem to enjoy this show even though it isnt based in reality theres much more to life than two young men farting on each other and throughout history there have always been shows that have come and gone that have been very bad and usually they get taken right off the air you see you should be spending your time enlightening your minds with more intelligent entertainment

pay attention children
im going to join your parents in requesting that you dont watch terrance & phillip any more ever

hey hes coming towards us
why is death coming after us
mrrr
ahhh
aaaah runrunruuun
mrrr
what are we gonna do
mooorrrr
as the day progresses more and more south park residents continue to sling shot their bodies into the side of the toon central building toon central is now under incredible pressure to cancel the show and has already lost over 20% of their sponsors
here carol i think its your boy
oh thanks what is it stanley-hon did you break something
mom death is here and and hes trying to take us all away with him
stanley honey you need to leave mommy alone im doing something very very important for your little well-being there
yeah but mom
here honey talk to your father
did you turn the heat down
dad death is coming
keep the thermostat under 70 and take care of your grandfather
mrrrr
dammit you know i think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on tv and more time worrying about whats going in in their kids lives this world would be a much better place
yeah i think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids
(you know what i think basically if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents control then what can you see itll stay the same because theyll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids)
totally dude
good point man
mrrrr
ahhhh
quick jump through the window
ehh eh ehhhh
mrrrr
aaaah aaaah aaaah
