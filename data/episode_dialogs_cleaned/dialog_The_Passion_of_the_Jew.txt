eric sweetie theres a bunch of people showing up in our backyard saying something about a meeting
yeah mom im holding a meeting for all the people who loved the passion as much as i did
oh thats great sweetie
tell them ill be down shortly
okay hon
töten sie die juden wir können nicht still stehen bis sie alle tot sind okay im ready im ready to do thy bidding mel gibson
hello are you folks holding this passion meeting
no actually were guests as well im jack garrett and this is my wife elise
hello
i think its so great that someone took the initiative to have a meeting like this
oh i agree there are so many of us who are moved by the passion its a perfect idea to have us organize so we can strengthen the christian community
and apparently the organizer is just an eight year old boy who was touched by the film
leave it to a child to show us all the way huh
yeah so i see this ad on the internet saying if you love the passion to come to this meeting so here i am
its great that everyone came here to figure out how to use the passion to enrich everyones lives
ah hello everyone achtung my name is eric cartman and im the president of the mel gibson fan club ah thank you thank you im happy to see that all of youwere affected by the passion like i was now we all know why were here and i believe we all what needs to be done
we sure do
but i think its best we dont talk out loud about it until we have most of them on the trains heading to the camps
wha- what does that mean sweetie
im not sure but- uh folks i just wanna interrupt for a second and say how remarkable it is that this little boy brought us all together the passion is causing a revolution of spirituality and we owe mel gibson and this little boy our thanks
thank you thank you very much now in order to do what we all know needs to be done we are first going to need more support i think we should all go out and take at least one other person to see the passion
oh what a great idea we each make it our responsibility to convert one more person
heheh great yeah great idea
yes and then we can begin the cleansing if you know what i mean
we sure do
yeah all right woohoo
thank you this must be the place goddamn mel gibson must be loaded
yes
oh hi uh my name is stan and this is kenny
(hello)
uh we saw your movie the passion and we didnt like it so can we have our money back please
you cant not like the passion i just followed the bible christ died for you go home
look dude we came a long way were not leaving until you give us our money
oh yeah well youre gonna have to find it first but i wont tell you where i keep my money you can torture me all you want i still wont tell you
tor- torture you
ha so you do intend to torture me huh well go ahead do your worst you still wont get your ticket money back i can take whatever you can dish out
we dont want to torture you
i get it but you dont have a choice is that it well go ahead i just sure hope you dont use those whips over there on the wall
dude can we please just have the eighteen dollars back from you
i have to use that money to build my church i brought the fire and brimstone back to christianity with the passion and now im gonna start my own church and do you know why so i can play banjo jesus oh how i love ya how i love ya jesus
dude this guy is freakin daffy
how dare you call me crazy this means war
and so it was that god sent his only son down from heaven to die for our sins
oh okay but did god sent jesus to die or did jesus just get kind of screwed over
what is troubling you my child
well i have this friend see and this friend belongs to a certain chosen people of israel and it so happens that these chosen people killed your lord
ah you mean hes a jew
right but he cant live with the guilt anymore because even if jesus wasnt really the son of god he was still a nice guy and he didnt deserve what happened to him in mel gibsons movie i i cant sleep at night i mean my friend cant sleep at night
yes the passion is very powerful the truth is theres not a whole lot in the bible about the crucifixion the passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the middle ages to incite people against the jews
but how can the jews make it better
well if you really care about your friends soul then perhaps show him the way of jesus remember christianity is about atonement
wait thats it atonement of course i know what i have to do now thank you father
aaaah
two days ago i saw a vehicle that would haul that tanker you wanna get outta here talk to me
mel gibson is fucking crazy dude wait theres his wallet
freedom
awww crap hes only got twenties you got two dollars kenny
jesus is lord
all right lets get the hell out of here
when youre a clown nobody takes you seriously
aah run dude run
kplagh kplagh and good evening frieeeeeeends
one month ago today this amazing film opened in theaters and now we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message fellow fans of mel gibson our numbers have grown and now together we have the power to change the world now i believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie
woah great idea
itll be like a parade
good idea
and as we march for the passion we should also voice our support so when i say "es ist zeit für säuberung" you all chant back "wir müssen die juden ausrotten"
well what does that mean dear
oh i think its aramaic you know like in the movie
ooo aramaic cool
neato thatll be awesome great
what was our aramaic line again
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit fër rache
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
oh this is fun
all right everyone forward march es ist zeit für rache
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit für rache
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
nice
shalom hak nak shalom and now one of our fine young shlokas kyle broflovski has asked if he could speak to the congregation
thank you rabbi in 1973 the united states officially issued an apology to the african american community for slavery in 1956 germany officially apologized for world war ii and the holocaust and now i believe in 2004 the jewish community needs to apologize for the death of jesus
what
whatwhatwhaaat
if we as a people choose not to believe that jesus is the son of god then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed and take our share of the responsibility for it
oh my god
kyle what on earth has gotten into you
i saw the passion
oh no the passion
this proves the anti-semitic effect that movie is having
yeah it makes jews into stereotypes
stereotyping jews is terrible
something must be done to stop that movie
now now everyone calm down we live in a rational community and everyone knows this is just a movie theres no cause for alarm
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit für rache
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit für rache
wir müssen die juden ausrotten
es ist zeit für rache
well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty seven dollars getting our money back from mel gibson but i think its the principle of the thing that matters
(yeah i agree)
oh youve got to be shittin me
give me back my money
goddamn that guys crazy hey dude youve gotta speed up
huh
mel gibson is chasing after us youve gotta go faster
haha very funny kid sit down and stop playing games
im not playing games mel gibson is right behind you and hes gonna-
what the hell
haaaa kplaaaa
hey thats mel gibson
yeah i told you that
well what the hell does he want
he wouldnt give us our money back for the passion so we kinda took it
you didnt like the passion but it shows how christ suffered for you mel gibson is a very spiritual man
both you guys stop please youre gonna make people hate us more
can i help you
this movie is causing anti-semitism you must remove it from your theater
thats right yeah remove your movie
remove it from the theater fat chance
we demand you stop showing it
yeah yeah
no no no dont become an angry mob the last time we did that we killed jesus
juden
whats going on here
theyre trying to have the passion pulled from the theater
this film is anti-semitic and it must be stopped
nonsense mel gibson is a smart and spiritual man theres nothing anti-semitic about it
it has reaffirmed all of our faith in christ
its made one of our little jewish boys want to apologize for the death of jesus
well maybe you should apologize
thats right what he said
how dare you
look out
give me my eighteen dollars
mel gibson oh mein savior mein führer youre actually here mr gibson i have assembled the masses we are ready to do thy bidding have i been a good boy mr gibson
ha so you boys have led me here to your secret base huh i guess now youre gonna start torturing me well oh my nipples are so tender dont squeeze them anymore
thats mel gibson
h- hes not quite as eloquent as i had pictured
yeah ill bet you wanna torture me now dont you
dude whats wrong with him
hes koo-koo dude hes absolutely out of his mind
you you would all love to torture me wouldnt you okay fine see what you can fit in there i can take it
dude ive been freaked out this whole time because of that guys movie
fine if nobody here is man enough to torture me then just give me my eighteen dollars
its our eighteen dollars your movie sucked
you cant say my movie sucked or else youre saying christianity sucked
no dude if you wanna be christian thats cool but you should follow what jesus taught instead of how he got killed focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the dark ages and it ends up with really bad results
you know hes right elise we shouldnt focus our faith on the torture and execution of christ
yeah lots of people got crucified in those times we shouldnt rely on violence to inspire faith
aw aw no come on people were so close to completing my final solution
oh dude i feel so much better about being jewish now that i see that mel gibson is just a big wacko douche
woohoohoo woohoohoohoohoo
