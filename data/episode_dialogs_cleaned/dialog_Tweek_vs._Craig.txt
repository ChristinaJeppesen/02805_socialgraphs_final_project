dahad if some kid in school wants to fight me what should i do
son let me tell you a little story about when your mother and i first met you see a long time ago there were a lot of guys who were after your mother she used to be very attractive
its true i was
well when i started courting your mother there was this big muscular football player named quib who didnt take too kindly to me he wanted your mother all to himself and so one day he challenged me to a fight
well
well what honey
nrr what happened
ohd i i dont know he moved away or something

okay so just to set the record straight here the fight will be happening out by the tetherball pole at 330 tweek just weighed in at 48 pounds craig at 45
uh how long do you expect the fight to last
i uh
however long craig wants it to last theh ub look make no mistake craig has been ready for this fight since day one he doesnt even view it as a challenge
hell view it as a challenge when hes getting his ass kicked
hup did you hear that it sound like some diarrhea coming out of someones mouth or something
shut up fatass
dont call me fat you son of a bitch
wow tweek and craig really hate each other huh this should be a good fight
on your first date look at the mans shoes sometimes you can tell how much money a man has just by his shoes when he takes you out to dinner try to sneak a peek at his wallet while he pays for you if he only has one credit card beware it means he doesnt spend a lot and worse yet it could be a debit card if he has more than four credit cards thats a little fishy the perfect number of credit cards for a man to have is two
what if we meet a guy who wants to be a doctor or a lawyer but is still getting his degree
dump that zero and get yourself a hero he could be earning that degree all his life while you starve to death with two dying babies sucking at your teats
when i have your guys ten bucks im gonna use it to buy the sweetest big-screen tv in the whole world
thats more than ten bucks you stupid fatass
well if i get ten buck from each of you thats like $2000
