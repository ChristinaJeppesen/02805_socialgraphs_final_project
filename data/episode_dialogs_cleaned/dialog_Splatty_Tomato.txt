mommy momm-mmy hes gonna get me
honey honey whos gonna get you
the president i saw him hes gonna get me
crystal the president isnt going to get you
but i saw him
see what i told you its that liberal school shes going to filling her head with all kinds of garbage sweetie the president is doing the best job he can your liberal school is just trying to convince you hes dangerous
but daddy hes getting-
uh uh no buts the president is in the white house not here trying to get you okay
oh-kaaay
all right were having a talk with that school in the morning good night honey
hey how are my approval ratings
and the latest reports are now saying that over a million canadians were killed in the nuclear blast the bomb dropped by the us president took out the entire city of toronto and fallout is expected to kill thousands more in the coming days
ike ike im sorry that i caused a nuclear bomb to be dropped on canada i was just- you know i was just trying to get shows that were toxic taken down you know those shows can be really harmful
ohhh stop being a victim jesus christ
what i wanna know is what gives you the right to preach your political views to my children our daughter woke up with nightmares that the president was going to get her just because two liberals happen to be principal and vice principal doesnt mean you can brainwash my kids
uh we sort of have some bigger problems right now mr uh
its white bob white you probably never even heard of our family huh well the whites have been here since the beginning not that it matters cause no one cares about the whites sure everyone else has problems but does anyone ask the whites how theyre doing
mr white we assure you that we run this school in a very professional manner and dont let personal emotions get in the way
oh sure you dont you know how hard i had to fight to even get this meeting with you "oh who wants to talk to the administration oh its just the whites oh who cares about the whites theyre fine" well weve just about had with you you understand and damn it we wont be ignored
im sorry is anyone else hearing "(if loving you is wrong) i dont want to be right" very very quietly
uh no mr and mrs white we promise that we will not let anything happen that might bring the integrity of this school into question
guess thats all the whites can hope for these days
hey
aaaagh
how are my approval ratings
its the president gaaahhh
wait come back whats wrong
still no word from the president as his splatty tomato approval rating drops to an unprecedented 3% this puts the president four points below nut job 2 nutty by nature meanwhile the canadian prime minister justin trudeau called upon canadians to stand strong
make no mistake america if you do not hand over your president there will be war the likes of which you have never seen canadians will rise together i call on all canadians here and abroad to stand with their country the us president must answer for his crime and only canada can bring him to justice
there there tweek everything is going to be okay
i saw what i saw craig you have to believe me
whats going on
tweeks having a panic attack
it was real he tried to get me
who did
the president
its just your imagination tweek
its not his imagination i saw him too
you saw the president
out by the quarry but i didnt believe it i said "how could this be"
"the president" i saw him too he had a blue suit and an orange face he kept asking me "how are my ap"
"how are my approval ratings" i saw him too
dude isnt this all really familiar i saw something just like this on that show called stranger
stranger things stranger things is the show i saw it too
but wait isnt stranger things just like that movie-
just like that movie it
you saw it too
yeah i saw it in the theater
i saw stranger things and it
jesus i dont think anyones imagining anything i think the president is here you kids get inside somewhere i have to warn the town aw
all right people people please we need everyone to try and stay calm
how can we stay calm while the presidents out there scaring our children
look we all want the president out of here its just a matter of how we do it i know you all want to get rid of him
thats not true the whites still support the president
oh for fucks sake white hes running around eating our pets and terrorizing our kids
you think hillary would have been any better
aw come on sit down bob
im just sayin im just sayin
listen everyone i have a team right now thats trying to locate the president and id like you to hear from officer bright whos leading the search
hey folks we know youre all uh concerned but i wanna assure you that were doing everything we can to track the president down and have him safely removed since the president was given a splatty tomato hes become very desperate and very dangerous if you see the president do not approach him do not try to reason with him most importantly remember that this is the president so you cannot shoot him all right you cant even talk about shooting him dont even do any coy satirical takes on shooting him okay good what were trying to do here is just get the president to go away were gonna be handing out padlocks like this one so everyone can lock up their garbage if we dont feed the president hopefully hell just move on are there any questions
can we talk about a friend shooting him if its in sort of a sarcastic way
no no no its just best to avoid that kind of talk altogether remember they can do to you what they did to kathy griffin
make her not funny for thirty years
thats right so best thing is just lock up your garbage and see if we can get the president to go away
jesus now kids are going missing
were all going to be missing soon nyaaarg
kyle
its my fault ike went to go take matters into his own hands i have to find him
