look we already told you everything we know some guy just showed up in a big balloon and took us into imaginationland
what we want to know is how we need to find a way into imaginationland youve been there how did you do it
we just went on a balloon ride
there must have been some kind of portal or doorway
dude we dont remember
do you realize whats goin on here terrorists have attacked our imagination and now our imaginations are running wild youd better start remembering
it was the chinese wasnt it
what
weve suspected that the chinese government was working on a doorway to the imagination is that where you were
no
thats it isnt it where do the chinese keep this portal how does it work
it is better than ours
your what
our portal to the imagination built as a secret project back in 1962 to fight the soviets-
shhh tom thats super-secret
ohh im sorry sir
wait the us government has a portal to the imagination
aw see good job tom why dont you just tell them everything about project x
yes sir we built a portal to the imagination to use against the russians during the cold war but we never got a-
that was sarcasm i was being sarcastic you fucking idiot
aw jeez im really sorry sir
if you already built a doorway to the imagination then why do you need us
all right we might as well show it to them god-dammit tom
every night the dream is the same im on my way to visit my friend kyle because we had a bet that if i could prove leprechauns were real he would suck my balls and it turns out i was right "time to pay up kyle" but then "no nooo" its been taken from me i have dry balls balls so dry they explode like dust
(echoing) aaaaahhhh
you okay kid
no ive got dry balls and im running out of time
ever since the cold war the us government has been working on a secret project to build a doorway into the imagination it is called "project imagination doorway"
thats not very imaginative
according to all the tests and the data the doorway should work but it never has
but were close sir were real close
theyve been saying that for over forty years
youre the ones right the kids who have been in the imagination
ah i guess
what was the sequence that got you inside we know theres some kind of resonance code but we cant figure it out
look were sorry you guys but the balloon just went up in the air and the dude sang a song and we were suddenly there
song you didnt say anything about a song before
what song
the imagination song
that could be it the fractal converter has never worked because it was waiting for a multitonal code
quick boys how does the imagination song go
imaginaaaation imaginaaaation
sir uh im getting some electrofeedback from the gate ih its weak but its nanoresponding to something
was there more to the imagination song ha how does the rest of it go
imaginaaaation imaginaaaa-

now come on yall we cant waste time arguing there could still be survivors out there we need to hunt them down and kill them
and eat their flesh
bhut first we should rape them
how about we kill them and then rape their bodies so we can use their blood as lubricant
say thats a great idea beary bear
man i do not want to meet the kid that dreamt those things up
look i want some goddamn answers you brought my friend here to washington where is he what is going on
im sorry sir that information is classified
something is going on and i have a right to know where my friend is

i was thinking of using a high-speed shutter with a low depth of field what do you think
goddammit cartman will you stop wasting time i wanna get this over with
no youre right kyle a higher depth of field will make sure everything stays in focus there we go now kyle when youre sucking my balls are you gonna think about how right i was about the leprechaun or are you just gonna try and focus on how rough and salty my balls feel in your mouth
lets just do it
in time kyle you certainly are eager for balls arent you are you ball-famished balls-starving you see kyle i wonder if at this moment you are actually-
everyone to the main hall now go

what imaginary character are you
the lollipop king from the lollipop forest
and im snarf snarf snarf snarf snarf
and what imaginary character are you
oh uhh uh im not imaginary ah im butters
whats a "butters"
the mayor brought him and some other kids into imaginationland just before the terrorist attack
so you came from the real world at precisely the same time as the terrorists that seems like quite a coincidence
i well i was just playin with my friends and then wu-we caught a leprechaun and then this guy-
you caught the leprechaun take him
perseus hes not against us snarf snarf
talk to me whats going on
something is coming through the gate from the other side
what is it
its like a half man half bear
and half pig
oh no no wait its like a half bear half manpig
look out
no i think its more like a half man and half pigbear
reverse the doorway send it back through
aaahhh
kyle
aaaaaaaaaaaa-
please i didnt help the terrorists get into imaginationland honest
that is for the council of nine to decide
dont worry kid the council of nine consists of some of the most highly-regarded imaginary characters in all imaginationland
fellow council these are indeed dark times the evil forces amass at our gates as we speak zeus believes we should evacuate
yes their power outmatches ours if they are giving us a chance to leave we must take it
and what say you morpheus
how our we to know that they will let us go their offer could be a trap
perhaps we must flee to the temple of alderon surely they wouldnt chase us there
no we cant come on you guys this is our home we have to fight to keep it the way it was meant to be
im with jesus the evil characters arent going to just let us go

that may be popeye but we dont have a choice
forgive my intrusion council of nine but this boy has infiltrated from the real world
bring him here
clear im sorry hes gone
no kyle cant die
im sorry young man
kyle
well at least now he doesnt have to suck anyones balls
nnnooo no he has a strong heart he wants to live come on kyle come on buddy
hes gone little boy
zap him again do it
charging
do it come on buddy
clear
come on buddy get out of here godammit kyle you never walked away from anything in your life now fight fight fight right now fu-hight fu-hu-hight fight give him some air there easy breathe easy
i believe this child was brought into imaginationland for a reason perhaps the mayor knew something we dont
what are you saying aslan that if we are to take back control we might-
yes if we are to take back control from the evil forces this little boy might be the key
awww im the key could i not be the key morpheus i dont wanna be the key
if you ever wanna see your home again little boy youll have to rise to this challenge
but i but im supposed to be at school right now uh and instead i got i got snarf and popeye and luke skywalker all pissed off
it is a dark time for all of us young boy but know that if you believe in yourself everything will turn out all right
sir are you sure about this
we have no choice terrorists have attacked us where we are most vulnerable theres no other option we have to nuke our imagination
wake up kyle
