and now larry king live
my guest tonight is the little boy who took over the whale wars reality show and turned it into a big hit please welcome stan marsh and his crew
ey jordan im on larry king mate
so stan what motivated you what inspired you to get out there and make a hit tv show
no i i dont really care about the tv show im just trying to stop the japanese from killing dolphins and whales
once you became captain the methods used to stop the japanese definitely became more aggressive was that the key to help boost your ratings
no i dont care about the show
were pirates
i just want people to know that you can stop the japanese if you have some real goddamned balls
ive got balls
well there are many people who see what youre doing as a positive thing and of course many that see problems with it joining us now is one of those people and you say stans methods are unethical
larry you cant just go out and take matters into your own hands like this if you want a hit tv show you have to go through producers directors people that are in unions
but sid you saw the show before stan took it over you have to admit that it was nothing but incompetent vegan pussies doing absolutely nothing and trying to turn it into drama
yes but it doesnt justify changing the entire show structure that their old captain had pitched to the network
can we please just talk about the actual whaling problem for a second
but their old captain paul watson was an unorganized incompetent media whore who thought lying to everyone was okay as long as it served his cause
he yes of course everyone knows that paul watson was a smug narcoleptic liar with no credibility but we must-
screw this i gotta get back to work
on this episode of real actual whale wars captain marsh searches for the japanese fleet knowing they could be absolutely anywhere
would you mind stepping back a little
captain captain some new volunteers showed up to help us in our crusade
no- dude we really cant take any more volunteers
but they say you know them
ahall right dude this is pretty sweet
oh no no no
what dude
oh what so now that i have a hit tv show you guys care about dolphins and whales
we always have
(yeah totally)
i asked you guys to help me and you said no
thats not what we said
you said "stan me and kenny dont give two shits about stupid-ass whales"
we were talking about wales the country
look if you admit that youre only doing this because you wanna be on tv then ill consider it admit you just wanna be on tv
(i just want to be on tv)
kenny i deserve to be on tv
captain captain the japanese have been spotted near buoy 24
take us out of port all hands to stations
all right lets go save those whales you guys
captain marsh races his boat to the last known location of the japanese whalers if he doesnt get there in time hundreds of dolphins or whales could die
as soon as we get there weve gotta deploy the tracking device we cant let those whales get hurt
what the hell was that
we just got rammed

(yeah can we go)
why have you done this why do you insist on-a making trouble for the japanese
why do you do what you do do you know that ninety eight percent of the world is against whaling why cant you just stop
you think you have the right to tell us what is okay i have-a something to show you
this is hiroshima over fifty years ago this entire city was-a destroyed by nuclear bomb we built this museum so that we never forget what-a happened
what dude
at-a 815 am the people of hiroshima were just minding their own business when out of nowhere a frash devastated them all women and children who died in the frash simply evaporated those reft arrive suffered the worst pain of all burns radiation poisoning for generations the radiation affected the victims japanese babies born without rimbs without eyes
sorry a little gassy scuse me
one hundred and forty thousand japanese were killed by atom bomb we have never recovered from the memory of that day it is impossible for a nation to ever forgive an act so horrible this-a picture shows the prane that dropped the bomb it was called the enora gay and it was frown by the monsters who dropped the bomb that day dohfin and weiru
ummm where did you get that picture
the americans were nice enough to give it to us the day after the bombing we were so-a thankful for the picture that the next day we ended our war with america we will never forgive never rest until they are all wiped out fuck you fuck you dohfin and-a weiru
so thats what this has all been about
dude it wasnt actually and dolphin and a whale who bombed hiroshima it was the-
zzzzt zzzzsssht dude they wont rest until whoever is responsible is completely wiped out
oh right look i i think i can make everything okay here can i just use a phone
hello stan
dude are you sitting at your computer i need you to do something for me
mister prime minister japanese officials theres something you need to know the photo you were given of the enola gay was doctored because the real bombers feared retaliation so badly that they simply pointed the finger at somebody else my government has authorized me to give you the original photo unaltered so you can finally know the truth dolphins and whales were just framed by the real bombers a chicken and a cow
chicken and-a cow chicken and-a cow
chicken and cow use poor dohfin and weiru as-a scapegoat this is outrage
fuck you cows
teikara chickens
great job son now the japanese are normal like us
