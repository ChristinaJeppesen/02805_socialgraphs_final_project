aaah dickens the imagery of cobblestone streets cragging london buildings and nutmeg-filled yorkshire puddings hello im a british person for years now the character pip has been featured prominently in the american show south park however many americans dont realize where pip came from hes the prowling little adorable englishman from charles dickens timeless classic "great expectations" and so tonight the makers of south park have agreed to take a break from their regular show and instead present the prestigious dickens tale in its entirety from beginning to end indeed after watching this show youll know the timeless classic as if youd read the cliff notes themselves our story is set in england in the small town of drop-a-chair-upon-top-snot where a young blond-haired boy named pip was on his way to see his parents

oh lookie heeah ive gone and made a metal newspaper
shut up you silly lip what are we supposed to do with a metal newspaper
well for starters we can look in the want ads and see if we can find pip a job ohhh lookie here young man wanted for paid position
where
where
"havisham residence seeks young boy to play with lonely daughter will pay up to" twenty quid a day
thats a lot of money-loney
you can keep a little girl company for 20 quid a day pip and old mrs havisham is the wealthiest woman in the town
well the very next day pip went to old ms havishams house to inquire about the job and it was there that he met the girl of his dreams
who are you
ive come to answer the want ad
is that so you smelly little bastard
what
this way you pathetic squirt of vaginal discharge this way you beef-witted shriveled-up monkeys penis up here you gamy mass of baby vomit in here
eho after you miss
im not going in there you stupid puddle of a homeless man urine
who is that
ive come to answer the want ad maam
come closer look at me does it frighten you to look upon a woman who has not seen the sun in over 20 years
oh no no you you sort of look upon one when you have not seen the sun for over 20 years quite a lot these days
i sometimes have sick fancies and i have a fancy i should like to see someone play so play play
um
estella play with this boy
with him but hes just a commoner
but you can break his heart
alright boy let us play
righty-o what are we going to play
were going to play a little game called "smack the blond boy in the head with a large log"
oh yes my sister and i play that game at home all the time who will go first
oh you stupid pathetic boy
what do you think of her
well uh i think shes very pretty
hm-m-m what else
i think shes rather insulting
hm you quite fancy her dont you come back again next week we shall "play" some more
that night pip spent all his sleeping hours unable to get estellas beautiful face out of his mind
stop dreaming about me you slow-witted rectal belch
day after day pip visited estella sometimes they would play sometimes they would talk but every single day pips love for estella grew
dont you wanna play anymore
boy do you still think im pretty
oho well yes miss
and do you still think im insulting
oh um not so much as before ow
i hate you youre an oozing painful hemorrhoid that belches pus
oh dear
you may kiss me if you like come let us walk in the daisy garden
oh what fun it is to splash about in the fountain you there the prowling little boy i bet you cant jump on my back go on then try and jump on my back
who is that
just another playmate hired to amuse me you didnt think you were the only one did you
oh i rather thought i was
oh you silly small-testicled boy come let us walk through the rose garden
yes good she will break his pathetic heart into a million pieces
well what a spot poor pip was in he was hired to be the friend of the very harsh and beautiful estella and although she treated him like dirt or perhaps because she treated him like dirt pip found himself more in love with the little girl each and every day oh bless him isnt he lovely but isnt it sad because pip knew that someone as sophisticated and as wealthy as estella could never love him for he was just a simple blacksmiths apprentice
and so you bang on this side and bang on that side and there you have it your very own metal fuzzy dice
yes i see hoh lovely
eeyyyy whats all this pip
joe do you know anything about girls
sure theyre those things with vaginas in them
but do you know anything about them about how they work
oh i dont know about that i just like to keep to me blacksmithin
do you think that a girl who is rich and educated would ever want to be with a blacksmith
oh dooooh no i dont think so pip who could that be
joe the blacksmith
the same
im a lawyer from london in search of a young lad named pip
im pip sir
mr blacksmith ive been sent here to offer you a reasonable sum of money in exchange for your apprentice
oh well uh pips not for sale sir
i have a client who wishes to give this bright child a future anything he desires do you still object
heaven forbid i should stand in the way of pips future but-
he will one day inherit a handsome property but the owner of that property wants him first to travel to london and learn to be a gentleman
thats great news
theres only one condition pip your benefactor wishes to remain anonymous
oho but it must be ms havisham
oh oh if you have any suspicion of who that person might be you are to keep it in your own breast understood
yes sir
then you will go to london in a weeks time heres 20 sterling well blacksmith you look stunned
i am sir
then i should take my leave good evening gentlemen and we shall see you in london next week pip
good-bye sir
pip a young gentleman of great expectations
you shall stay here with your roommate mr pocket he is a distinguished young lad who will help you on your way to being a gentleman i trust you see no problem with this
none sir
i should think not on up then and prepare for school on the morrow
yes sir thank you sir
mr pip
mr pocket
pray come in
thank you kindly you do look rather familiar
as do you perhaps weve seen each other before as to our lodging its not by any means splendid this is our sitting room - just chairs and tables and carpet and so forth this is my little room - rather musty and this is your bedroom
my how lovely
oh what a gay time we shall have and i do mean gay as in festive not as in penetration of the bum oh but dear me i beg your pardon youre holding your bags all this time pray let me take them im quite ashamed
oh its quite alright lord bless me why youre the pale young man i saw at ms havishams house
why yes of course youre the prowling little boy boy what a smashing coincidence
perhaps but perhaps not ms havisham is very generous indeed
that old biddy oh i assure you i have nothing to do with her anymore shes absolutely mad
well what do you mean
well dont you know about ms havishams melancholy past dear me its quite a story and should be discussed over dinner come right time for a smashing meal and the story of ms havisham
pocket may i ask you a favor i am desperately trying to become a gentleman for the love of a certain girl so will you please tell me if i do something wrong at the table
youll do fine dear fellow just fine now on to ms havisham she was raised by a wealthy father and grew up to be a somewhat of a spoiled brat and now i might mention pip that in london it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth
hoh dear im terribly sorry
not at all im sure anyway ms havisham grew up to be a lovely young lady and soon a man came along which gets me to the cruel part of the story merely breaking off pip to remark that a dinner napkin should never be placed into the tumbler
sorry sorry
not at all im sure so this man pursued ms havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her she passionately loved him back the marriage day was fixed the wedding dress was bought the wedding guests were all invited and finally the day came but not the groom and i break from the tale now only to mention that one should never pass gas at the dinner table
oh excuse me
not at all im sure so the groom never showed he simply wrote a letter a letter that ms havisham received 20 minutes before the wedding
at half nine the time when she stopped all the clocks in the house
but afterward she laid waste to the entire house as you have seen it and has never since looked upon the light of day and the story ends pip with me suggesting that one should never pull out the wee wee and check it for scabs whilst at the table
terribly sorry pocket
not at all im sure
and so pip spent the next several months learning how to be a gentleman he was schooled in several languages he was taught fencing and marksmanship and he was shown how to dance and eat box and after it all after weeks and weeks of intense schooling pip was finally a full-fledged gentleman proud of himself pip decided to pay ms havisham a visit to thank her for her generosity and to see if he was indeed now good enough for estella
good evening ms havisham
come closer pip my youre quite the gentleman now arent you
thanks to you
perhaps estellas been off to school as well shes become quite the lady would you like to see a picture of her
oh my she is even prettier than before
ohoh you love her dont you pip
i dont know i mean i think about her every day
do you know what love is pip it is blind devotion unquestioning self-humiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to snip it
righto
love her pip i developed her into what she is so that she might be loved
yes but where will i find her
theres a dance at the palace tomorrow night estella will be there go and seek her out and love her love her
thank you ms havisham for everything im the happiest boy in the land
and if she warms to you love her she tears your heart into pieces and as you get older it will tear deeper lover her
yes our young pip had come a long way from the apprentice of a blacksmith to a fine young gentleman of great expectations and now he was to finally see his beloved estella again at a grand ball held by the king of england tony blair it was here that pip would finally and formally ask estella to be his girlfriend and all would be right with the world
hello estella
pip my goodness how youve changed
yes ive become a gentleman may i
i suppose so how is it that youve learned to dress and dance
well i was sent to be schooled in london
iiii see and you no longer live with the blacksmith
oh i see joe once in a while but i dont have much in common with him anymore now that im a gentleman and all
naturally
it is wonderful to see you again estella
is it why
because i believe im in love with you
pip you must know that i have no heart
i think you do
oh i have a heart to be shot or stabbed in no doubt and if it cease to beat i should cease to be but you know what i mean i have no softness there no sympathy sentiment
i see past that estella i see a little girl who wants to be warm and kind
hey estella lets get out of here
alright steve just one moment
who who is that
that is steve he is seventeen and has a car
i see and you fancy this steve fellow
i should hes my boyfriend
boyfriend
whats the matter pip
i dont understand i did everything right i stopped being a poor commoner i even blew off my lovin joe
its its the way it goes sometimes pip hes seventeen and has a car im im very im leaving
ms havisham you have to talk to estella shes going out with a-
well well well if it isnt mr pip
ms havisham but um
dont they make a handsome couple pip look at the way he holds her hand
but i dont understand you sent me away to become a gentleman so that i could be with estella
things arent always as they seem pip oh whats the matter did she break your heart
well i suppose that if you set out to break my heart you did a very good job of it because it certainly does hurt
yes tell me about the pain tell me about the crushing and the prickly things
its a-as if sssomeone has a hold of my heart and isss squeezing it very tightly
yes and it is somewhat difficult to breathe
hey wait a second you mean that this whole thing was just a setup by your mom
is your heart broken as well tell me all about it
but why do you make your daughter hurt people
wuh-hy well thats simple because i need the tears of broken-hearted men to use in my genesis device you see my foolish child im growing very old but tonight i will fuse my soul into estellas once and for all and then i can go on breaking mens hearts for another generation
what the hell
estella prepare yourself for the genesis platform
oh no you dont youre my girl and im not lettin you walk out on me what the
and as for you pip my robot monkeys should take care of you
pip pip old chap
joe
thats right youre safe and warm now
joe found you lying face down in the street mr pip you were in such a state youve been unconscious here for nearly three hours
ms havisham she has all the men who have had their hearts broken by estella trapped in her house oh why would she have wasted all that time sending me to school and making me into a gentleman
well about that pip theres another person who wants to see you
allo pip you remember me
escaped convict
why youre the escaped convict i helped a long time ago
yes after you helped me i moved to wales and made somethin o myself if it werent for you id have never become a millionaire
es the one that sent you to london pip es the one who sent you off to be a gentleman
you but why
because back then you treated me like any other person youre werent a snob and you helped me as you would a rich man
oh dear all this time i thought it was ms havisham she totally let me believe it
i tried to tell you pip shes a vengeful spiteful woman who wanted nothing more than to see you hurt along with the rest of the male sex
well ive certainly learned a lot that being a gentleman doesnt mean learning to dance or proper table manners it means being a gentle man gentle to everyone
righto pip righto
and now i suppose theres only one thing left to do
whats that pip
if ms havisham is determined to do this to others lets go kick her arse
yeah
and now we come to the final act of the dickens classic tale in which the stage is set for an epic showdown ms havishams robot monkeys prove a formidable foe but pip is not about to let estellas soul be forever consumed by the genesis device and now the thrilling conclusion of great expectations
are you ready estella are you ready to complete the cycle
yes mother
not so fast you ugly ancient bitch
pip
your manhating days are over ms havisham
quite the contrary blacksmith my revenge on the male race is only about to begin
dear god pip look
estella help me im your boyfriend
so am i
and me
we were all estellas boyfriends at one time or another now were doomed
yes cry away males once your tears have collected into the genesis device the fusion of estella and me will be complete
you wont get away with this
wont i let the transformation begin
pip she started the device
pocket get over there and do whatever it takes to keep those blokes from crying
righto pip
it begins
come estella you cant want to be part of this
it is what i was raised for
aaaaaaa
hello gentlemen oh whatever you do please do not cry havishams device fuels itself on your tears im afraid
how are we not to cry our hearts have been broken our lives ruined and now we are set to die
yes but just think about panda bears oh theyre so cuddly and sweet panda bears are what silly little noses they have
panda bears make me sad theyre almost extinct
oh right right lets not think about panda bears then lets think about swimming oh what jolly fun swimming is with a splishy-splash and a hold-your-breath dive
yes
get out of that chair you old cow
estella listen to me you are a wonderful girl with a kind heart
i told you pip i have no heart
but you do and i shall prove it to you once and for all look at this adorable little bunny
oh my es very cute
you see that a heartless person wouldnt care at all about this bunny theyd just as soon break its neck oh but look at this bunny there you see that you have too big a heart to kill two baby bunnies right
oh what fun it is to collect stamps lick the backs put them into books all neat and tidy with those smashing little pictures and bright colors
my father died in a stamp-collecting accident
right lets not talk about stamp-collecting then lets talk about
ice-skating
oh what fun ice-skating is who can catch me who can catch the ice-skating king thats me
oy cant figh em off no moh
nine nine baby bunnies a person with a heart could never kill nine baby bunnies so you do have too big a heart to- ten baby bunnies
theres too many of them
please sirs you must not cry
we cant help it youre bawlin us to tears
philip its too late
twenty-six baby bunnies
i dont want to i dont see the point in this
what
i dont want to kill any more of them
there you see you do have a heart
you think so let me see it maybe i can kill it
no no im sure of it you have a heart youve bought your own life come with me now
yessss noooo
ooooo top smart pip
you did it pip
well i guess old ms havisham wont be takin any revenge on any more blokes ey
yes her poor miserable life is finally over
youre released from her now estella now we can begin our life together
yes yes my small-testicled love
oh im so glad everything has worked out where are all my little bunnies that you borrowed then pip
and they all lived happily ever after except for pocket who died of hepatitis b so ends charles dickens great expectations we hope you now have a deeper appreciation for pip and indeed all masterpieces of literature like this one until next time im a british person good night
