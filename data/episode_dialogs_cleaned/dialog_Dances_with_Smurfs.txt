oh god he shot him
ya had to push me didnt ya now you
haaaaaaaaaa sir i truly dont know- th-aaaaa aaaa
there hows it feel huh
please i dont know you uughuh
youre gordon saltski right truck driver from chicago
no im gordon stoltski third grader who reads the morning announcements
yeah right well see if thats true go on read the morning announcements
somebody help me
i said do it
aaaaa aaaaa aaaaaaaaaa aaa any any interested students should fill out an applicant survey-- waa waaaaaaaaaa
i knew you were lyin that was terrible now put your mouth over the barrel of this gun
no please im so scared im so scared
do it
please ill duh ill do whatever you say here here i see here i got my mouth on the ba-
look at you now were all dead
we will always remember the way that gordon bravely read the announcements every morning led us in the pledge of allegiance mkay and touched many kids lives here at the school and even though we now know the shooter had him confused with a forty-year-old truck driver who happened to have a similar name i know this has been pretty traumatizing mkay but now we must decide who will pick up where little gordon left off who will take his place reading the morning announcements its a big responsibility because it will be your voice the entire school listens to mkay and although gordon stoltski can never be replaced mkay there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to have his or her voice heard every morning
oh my goodddd
soo youre uuh trying out to be the morning announcement person as well

good morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements and i am eric cartman all forms for the school book drive must be handed in to mr davis in the library by the end of the school day today hm doesnt seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that uh kay oh well for lunch today the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches cold sandwiches oh well thank you so much remember when we used to be served hot food i mean what has happened to our school this school is transforming into something very bad and why because we have leadership that doesnt care im talking of course about our student body president wendy testaburger ever since wendy was elected student body president this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice the music room will be closed off today due to painting all students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead oh oh so now so now the school is using money to paint the music room how old and outdated is our playground equipment what other school has a fifteen-year-old merry-go-round on it our school president is turning this whole place into communist russia its not a coincidence that once wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams your teachers dont wanna tell you but they are scared and they should be because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners
oh jeez
but hey im just a normal kid like you except that i ask questions and because im brave enough to ask questions i come under scrutinies is wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin probably not but how can we know i dont want my lunch money going to drugs whos taking these drugs what would be the point im asking questions
will somebody shut him up
you wanted to see me principal victoria
the job is to read what is written on the paper eric not to embellish the way you do
oohhhh i get it youre trying to silence me youre scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once
no its just that the announcements need to be quick so the students can get on with their work
oh really then how come gordon stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day
well because he was being murdered
you just want somebody to read whats in front of them like a brain-washed zombie is that it mr mackey i am not gordon stoltski okay im not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what hes told until hes killed
all we ask is you keep it shorter
oh i will and maybe ill also have a word with the aclu tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school im sure theyll find that very interesting
well goood morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements tryouts for the soccer team are on friday afternoon that is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field i have a question what does wendy testaburger actually do she is supposed to be the president right what is her agenda shes lying to everyone or is she lets ask these questions today i wanna talk briefly about the state of our schools economy the bake sale last week was a complete failure and in the school- and besides that who actually voted for wendy testaburger i know i didnt and everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin "whoops guess i shouldnt have done that" im not in the student council im just a normal kid like all of you and like all of you i want to know what has happened to my school
i pledge allegiance to the fag -
- of the united states of america our united states not the one wendy testaburger would have a socialist dunghole -
- a socialist dunghole
good morning students these are the morning announcements if youll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class you will see that the announcements are now being done in video
oh god no
lunch today is going to be pizza again friends our school is dying and you know it you feel it youre like youre like me you wanna change it but ohhh no wendy testaburgers not gonna let that happen this is not the school we grew up in and and i dont know if we can get it back so lets take a look at exactly what our school president wants you know what is she trying to achieve lets just take a look at these keywords here wendys made it clear she wants our school to be a more integrated leftist and liberal place but you see what then happens what we get is a socialist modern utopian reformed farce of a school so when you look closely it becomes very obvious what wendy wants k i l l s m u r f s our school president wants to kill smurfs
nooo
i dont know if were turning into a smurf-hating school or what were turning into but unless you ask why were gonna transform into something
hey wendy wendy is it true
is what true
that you hate smurfs
i dont have time for this
hey now me and us fellers were just asking questions
yeah thats right we can ask
try to understand this all i do is try to help run student council i dont give a crap about smurfs
it is true
oh my god
yeah bemememe
oh my god
maybe you guys should check into what student council actually does before you just blindly listen to what some idiot with a microphone tells you
what did the smurfs ever do to you ya bitch i just called the president a bitch
hyeah
that was cool
awesome
yeah that was cool
yeah great job
"thank you" and this is to
douglas
"to douglas" there you go book signing today everyone be sure to pick up your copy
hey eric
well hello another person who cares about the future of our school
oh you bet i love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything and how shes changing everything
yes well now you can read about all those things ive said butters take this copy of my book
cool thanks
thatll be five dollars
oh okay
what the hell do you think youre doing
a book signing
i looked through your stupid book its five hundred and forty pages of ripping on wendy and calling her a slut
i do not directly say shes a slut
"wendy testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old in-out for hours on end"
you didnt read the rest dude
"or does she"
"or does she" see thats a question im asking questions stan ive called for wendy to come on my show and defend herself but she wont do it
yeah and she hates smurfs
"shouldnt we be worried if our school president is a girl who would rather get her tits licked than go to student council meetings"
hey hey stop reading that
wull what do you mean
listen just because a guys voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book doesnt mean he has any idea what hes talking about
yes it does
eric cartman is simply making it so that all kids take responsibility to question their school leaders we should all ask if our president is a penis-hungry hooker with a huge vagina im casey miller
wendy did you see the stuff cartman is saying about you now
i really dont care stan
well dont you think you should go on his show and defend yourself everyone is starting to think youre a crappy president
im not giving eric fartman one minute of my time you got that im not acknowledging his stupid questions if you want him dealt with youll have to do it yourself
you wanted to see me again principal victoria
eric weve been informed by a concerned student that you are writing naughty books about one of the girls here at the school
oh wendy came and told on me so what because shes president she cant be written about
eric apparently you wrote that wendys private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through mkay
and what if they are youll stop me from asking just because wendy forces you to
eric the student body president really doesnt have the kind of power that you-
just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book face it youre a lackey mackey
eric ive had enough you cannot and you will not sell your books on school grounds do i make myself clear
clear as summer rain clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water this school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isnt free well im not gonna be a part of it do you understand im leaving this hypocritical communist school im walking out and im never coming back
live from the principals office these are the morning announcements here is eric cartman
yesterday as most of you know i walked out on this program and on our school i was so fed up with our presidents hypocrisies me not being allowed to sell my book i wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld and so i decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the smurfs i simply observed the gentle smurfs at first i wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives they were wary of me in the beginning but slowly i began to earn their trust it wasnt long before the gentle smurfs accepted me as one of their own
whoa
the smurfs and i grew to understand each other they shared with me their art of picking smurfberries and i shared with them stories of my countrys forefathers of course it wasnt long before i fell in love with smurfette were from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion
"these are the morning announcements"
papa smurf was displeased at first he told smurfette i wasnt a real smurf and we could never be happy but i eventually proved myself to papa smurf by picking more smurfberries than any smurf had ever smurfed before finally all was right with the world but then a crisis clumsy smurf burst into the smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of smurfland
no no you must leave the noble smurfs alone whos behind all this i should have known wendy
out of my way
wendy what are you doing here
smurfberries are worth a lot of money with all those smurfberries i can power the school for the entire year
wendy i know youre president of our school but you cant just dig up the smurfs land
fuck the smurfs they can suck my fat tits
how many smurfberries is enough wendy
you can suck my fat tits too
smurfette noooo
suck mah fat tits
and so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable smurfberries yeah well big deal at what cost did our school president get it every smurf is dead wiped out and we will never see them again go on look outside you wont see any smurfs of course since im being silenced im not allowed time to show you the entire movie and so please buy dances with smurfs available now on dvd the question now is what happened to morals what happened to dignity what happened to my schooool
that does it our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with
i can no longer stand idly by
we need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school we will forever remember this day the day we finally stood up to wendy testaburger
it is time for that slutty smurf-killing bitch to get whats comin to er
yeah
i dont know about all of you but i have had enough weve been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet but today we do something about it so lets march right over there to wendys house and do what we know needs to be done
let us not forget what happens this day
do it
we are here wendy testaburger
take that school president
get her good
i am
hey what are you doing
the students want answerrrrs go on the morning announcements if youve got nothing to hide
what the hell
wah smurfkiller answer for your crimes on the morning announcements
wendy did a boy just pee on our door because the smurfs were murdered
its okay dad ill take care of it
thank you so much for finally coming on my show wendy
yeah well butters peed on my house
people are riled up hopefully we can clear the air here this morning
if we could just keep it to questions about student council
of course thats why were here
five seconds
dont worry i wont go too hard on you good morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements rehearsals for the school play are cancelled this afternoon for lunch the cafeteria will be serving meat loaf or veggie pasta my guest today is the student body president of south park elementary wendy testaburger wendy thank you for coming on the show
sure
wendy i wanna start by asking a pretty straightforward question and i hope you dont take offense to it
okay
how many smurfberries is the life of each smurf worth
i dont i i have no idea what-
you dont know how many smurfberries the life of each smurf is worth
ohhh hes got her now
would you agree that the school is in a crisis right now
i believe there is a few things wrong with the school but-
if a smurf dies and no one is around to hear it does it still scream
shes speechless
you are the president of the school can you see why many students think youre an ineffective slut are you denying that the smurf holocaust ever happened is that what youre suggesting
look eric you have to understand the smurfberries were our school governments only option
yes and that makes- whoa whoa what
what was i supposed to do the school was running out of power we tried relocating the smurfs at first but they wouldnt budge so we decided to get somebody on the inside a member of the school who could act like one of the smurfs and learn their secrets but of course you know that dont you
what what do you mean i know that
im just asking a question we all knew you were sent in to live with the smurfs but did you know they would be wiped out
no you wiped them all out
nobody expected you to fall in love with smurfette you went to learn from them but instead you became one of them right fought against your own kind when you knew wed stop at nothing do you know that one smurfberry can power the school for two months one smurfberry
wait hold on can we take a break
no its okay its all out in the open now i wouldnt have had to kill the smurfs if they would have simply moved on but you gave them the will to stay and i guess you cant be blamed for that
what
and that is why im stepping down you were right all along cartman and i am hereby making you the student body president
all right cartmans president we did it
im confused
dude you cant take my dances with smurfs idea and turn it into your own thing-
no youre right the students all deserve to know the truth and so i have answered what really happened in my new book going rogue on the smurfs
no no dude you dont just take one persons story and then add a couple of things and call it yours
luckily with the money i made selling the movie rights to my book ill be okay
you sold the movie rights to who
james cameron go look the movie came out already
theh- they cant do that im student body president
oh god damn it son of a bitch idea-stealing assholes you sons of bitches dances with smurfs was my idea my idea you cant just take dances with smurfs and call it something else
huh
dude what happened youre not doing the morning announcements anymore
no because it turns out that by rule the student body president cant also be the morning announcement reader
oh well at least as president you can run the school the way you want
i cant do jack i went to my first student council meeting all we did was talk about what colors to make the stupid sadie hawkins dance student councils retarded
the sun is up and the birds are chirping im casey miller and these are the morning announcements i have a letter from second-grade student brian falner brian writes "dear casey why is our school president such a fat stupid dickhead my desk is broken and so far eric cartman has done nothing about it will you please let that walking bowl of anus pus know that we are not happy" well brian i couldnt agree more our asshole president is a fat smelly douchebag milkshake
im doin the best i can
