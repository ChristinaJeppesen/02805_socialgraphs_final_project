no you cant
what
kyle your mother and i dont want you going to the raging pussies concert we gave you a chore that we thought was impossible you werent supposed to actually do it
but i did ah i brought democracy to cuba
we know kyle but we just dont want you going to their concert
but thats not fair you lied to me
kyle perhaps we handled this wrong buh- but you need to understand that we dont want-
what i understand is that you totally screwed me over so why should i have to listen to you
because were your parents
well i wish i didnt have any parents
kyle
its so unfair how can my parents do that to me
parents can be pretty cruel sometimes dude they get off on it
theyre evil i wish i didnt have any parents
well you could make them go away for a while
how
well i mean you could call the police and have them take your parents away
the police
yeah i saw it on tv all you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you
whats that
i dont know but it works when i wanted to get rid of my moms last boyfriend i just called the police and said he was molestering me and i havent seen him for three months
wow three months without parents
(wow that is awesome)
but what do the police do to them
who cares my parents deserve whatever they get theyre liars and cheats
you have to make it convincing though when you call the police you have to be like "my parents molestered me"
"my parents molestered me"
no but youve gotta cry like this "my parents molestered me" and then theyll say something like "was it a good touch or a bad touch" and you say "uh it was a good touch" or- no wait you say it was a bad touch
whats "bad touch"
something about a swimsuit - i dont remember but you definitely answer "bad touch"
okay molestered bad touch
yeah and cry oh hes ready
oh my god this isnt happening i would never touch my children like that
you do have the right to remain silent maam i suggest you use that right
ugh please just listen to me what about my children who will take care of them
oh now you care theyre going to live with their grandmother
their grandmothers been dead for three years youre not listening to me kyle tell these people that your- mother never raped you tell them its my fault say it tell them right now
theyll never be able to hurt you again

yes
if we tell you will you help us stop fatass
ill do anything to get to a phone
alright everybody gather round were gonna tell the story of the before time again
the before time
the story of the before time
way back in the long long ago we all lived by the birth-givers laws but the birth-givers were unfair they made us go to bed early and eat broccoli
yuck yuck yuck
and so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birth-givers disappear by using the magic m word
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
soon we were without power water or fresh food but we tried to survive under the guidance of the provider
provider provider
the fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider the fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal so we made ourselves the superintendents of school but then he just made himself the mayor the town split sides and thats when the provider got angry
boo
bwack bwack
coosh
so now every night the provider must be appeased at carousel we need their book so one of ours doesnt die
carousel carousel
we all know that one day the provider will set us free make everything like it was in the before time in the long long ago
ah-ah-ah-ahlet me get this straight if i go get the fat kids book on the other side of the white line youll show me where a cell phone is
