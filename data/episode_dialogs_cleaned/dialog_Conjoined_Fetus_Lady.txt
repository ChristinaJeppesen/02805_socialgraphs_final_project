yeah
so lets have half the children on this side and half the children on that side
uhh excuse me a moment gentlemen i dont believe i know how to play dodgeball
what dont you have dodgeball in france
well no and actually im not from france--
look pip the rules are simple a kid from that team is gonna try to bean a kid on our team in the head with a big red ball
oh dear
if the ball hits you youre out but if you catch the ball hes out and the last team to still have anybody standing wins
oh what jolly good fun
no it isnt it hurts i cant believe they let us play this in school
play ball
ow ahow-ow-ooooowww
dammit we lost one already
aheeheh youre out clyde heheheh
jordan swanson pull forward we need backup
were losing men fast out here
concentrate on your ge-hame be the buhaw-hall
i caught it i caught it
great catch kyle now your teams on offense
here pip you throw
ugh oh no i couldnt
come on limey dont be a wuss are you just gonna be a little french pansy your whole life
im not french--
throw the ball you stupid frog
goddamn maybe if you didnt eat all those croissants
youd be able to-- ow
okay that was pretty good pip but youre supposed to hit the kids on the other team
ow my nose you broke my nose
damn pip i didnt know you had it in you
ogh im dreadfully sorry
that nose is bleeding pretty bad kyle i think you might have to go to the nurses office
no no itll be okay
sorry son youll have to let the nurse look at it come on
oh-- noooo
dude hes going to the nurses office
i heard the school nurse is hideously deformed
i heard she has tentacles and eats children for lunch
stan has anybody actually seen the nurse and come back to tell about it
no cartman nobody ever has
are you kyle broflovski
ye-yes
im the school nurse did you hurt your nose
ye-yes
young man why do you have your eyes closed im not gonna hurt you
i know
so open them
oh phew
now what seems to be the problem
aw i just hit my nose playing dodgeball
oh well ill get you an ice pack
aaggggghhhh
what
ooooohhhhh my god
oh i see youve noticed my disorder i have a stillborn fetus growth attached to my head
aaaarrrrgggggghhhhh
and when she moved up and down the little fetus jiggled
eewwww
did it talk the little fetus did it talk
no no-it looked dead
eewwww
wa-was it wearing clothes
dude where is she gonna get fetus clothes
oh yeah eeww
eewwww
and then she walked over to--
kyle that is enough ive been reading up on your poor nurses condition and it is nothing to be made fun of its called "conjoined twin myslexia"
who the hell cares what its called as long as she doesnt have to touch me
now thats just the kind of unawareness that we need to fight against sit down boys
you see boys sometimes when babies are born theyre born as twins but sometimes the twins get hooked together and theyre born as siamese twins
gross
but sometimes after the siamese twins are joined together one of the twins dies before birth the living baby is born with the dead baby still attached
sometimes this dead twin is inside the living person so even you could have a dead twin inside you and not even know it
agggggghhhhhh
agghhh let me live aggghhh
so now that youre educated about her disease you wont need to make fun of her right bubbe
uhhhh yeah
can you imagine that poor poor woman
mm-hmm
feeling like an outcast being ridiculed every day
mm-hmm
hello
hello sheila its sharon stans mother
oh yes hello sharon
sheila i was just wondering if you might know why my son is trying to split his head open with an ice pick
no i have to get it out
well sharon i was just trying to educate them about conjoined twin myslexia
so this is your fault
arrrggggggghhhhhh
dammit stop
oh
dammit
would you do me a favor next time you want to scare the hell out of my child just go outside and sit in the road until a truck runs you over instead
that does it i must educate the entire town about this awful disease
mm-hmm
dude i dont get it why are we playing dodgeball again
yeah i thought we only played on fridays
children great news weve been asked to play in the state finals for dodgeball
awww
aw do we have to
cant we just play with that big parachute again or something
you-you dont understand children if we can win state we can play in the nationals in washington dc
heyh they have a zoo there
thats right now come on we have a lot of practicing to do
arent we supposed to have won something in order to go to state finals
hey pip do you wanna be on my team again
id love to
now lets try not to send anyone to that monster nurse this time frenchy
hey i get quite disturbed when you call me that you shouldnt make fun of foreigners
and besides i hate french people
well mrs broflovski it certainly is a thrill seeing your cheery face again what seems to be pissing you off today
nothing is pissing me off i just wanta start a movement
o-of course you do
i want to talk to you all about your school nurse
uh nurse gollum is absolutely qualified to be a--
no no no im not upset about her i want to make the public aware of her her disease should be brought to light so that it can be understood rather than made fun of
oh and uh what disease is that
uh principal victoria nurse gollum has conjoined twin myslexia
whats that
she has a dead fetus attached to her head
she does
y-you never noticed that
no-o i never did
well thats exactly what im talking about this poor woman is forced to live in the shadows because she feels like an outcast it is up to us to make her feel comfortable and welcome in our town
did you say a fetus sticking out from her head
i want to invite your nurse to a dinner party at my house this evening id appreciate it if both you and mr mackey would attend
do we have to eat kosher stuff
well ill talk to nurse gollum but im sure shell be delighted lets say around 800
wonderful

yes principal victoria the thought had occurred to me unfortunately it would mean my death

ladies and gentlemen this is indeed a great week for south park ms hermans has opened the east wing of the library and our own south park cows elementary school dodgeball team is going to the national finals
where they will undoubtedly be beaten senseless by the washington team
but most importantly this week has brought to my attention a very serious and dreaded disease conjoined twin myslexia and so it is in honor of this that i declare this exciting week as conjoined twin myslexia week
and now lets kick off our week long festivities with the first annual grand conjoined parade
lets hear it for these brave souls
