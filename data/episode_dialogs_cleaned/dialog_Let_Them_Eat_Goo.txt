good morning everyone morning so listen guys we are not in good shape the whole "doing business in china" thing has sort of bitten us in the ass and now we arent selling enough weed to keep up with our costs you see this this right here thats us plateauing we no longer get any of that sweet chinese money and now all the money we do make doesnt even cover our expenses so how do we sell more weed stan
i dont know do like a sale like a fall sale
not good enough shelly
i hate marijuana
nice attitude how do we sell more weed sharon
if you dont make commercials or do more parades for the town wed have more money
right cut out all our marketing thats sharons great idea everyone towelie
you know what the problem is its the schwag all those stands and seeds they just go to waste man
go on
its like we sell all the good parts of the weed but we throw away like tons and tons of all the leftover shit you can sell that crap as mulch to a hardware company
mulch use our discarded product to recover costs everyone great job you just got powned by a towel

what kids were complaining about health and sustainability what kids would care at all that- the girls
the girls
the fucking girls excuse me can someone explain to us why this is on our lunch trays
yeah its supposed to be sloppy joe day
we asked for healthier options and to sometimes have food for those of us who dont eat red meat
oh my god im about to lose my mind you think you can just mess with a mans lunch

oh give me a break its not just girls who wanna change the menu its boys too
yeah i want vegan food
a lot of students are protesting
well their protesting is ruining my lunch
we have a right to free speech
yes we do all have freedom of speech but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when youre not thinking about others and youre only thinking about yourself
whoawhoawhoawhoa whats goin on kids
the protesters are tryin to kill eric again mr mackey
okay kids we dont want another incident here okay
theyre trying to take peoples lunch they dont realize it harms people financially physically emotionally and spiritually
eric its okay we arent going to change the school menu okay everythings fine

alright everyone listen up as you know there are several students protesting the school menu but there are other students who are voicing their concerns against changes eric cartman is still recovering in the hospital we all wish him well now the school has been looking into several options to deal with the problem and i do believe we have found a compromise we have found a new company in the plant-based fast-food industry who would like to be the supplier for our cafeteria and so please welcome the founder of incredible meat
hello children i want to thank you and i want to thank your fine principal for hearing me out i take plants and i process them into goo im a goo man i have factories all over the country i have trucks right now loaded with goo that can be here within the week the goo i speak of can be made into anything it can be made into tacos it can be made into hot dogs and i promise you that none of you students will know the difference i would very much like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your school i would like to be the plant-based meat vendor for your town im a simple family man and a vegetarian i would like the opportunity to make you all vegetarians as well and i thank you
eating meat doesnt just hurt animals it hurts people it takes 13 pounds of grain to produce just one pound of animal meat all that plant food could be used much more efficiently if-m if people just ate it directly meat is also not environmentally friendly meat production is wasteful and causes enormous amounts of pollution and the meat industry is one of the biggest huh oh i was just saying that adopting a vegan diet is way more effective than switching to a greener car in the fight against climate change for your health for our planet for the animals and for each other we have to switch to plant-based foods now it just so happens-
you gotta be kidding me
its our grand opening come and visit your towns only plant-based burger joint

yeee-haw
ive been in your town a little while now what i see is a community that is ready for change you see i am a goo man what i serve in your school cafeteria is a synthetically-modulated plant protein i have taken over nearly all the fast food restaurants here in town and teamed up with the fine people in your community this my new regional manager hw
its rick
shut up hw you see im trying to reach all the school cafeterias all the stadiums fast food restaurants all the places that serve shitty food and serve shitty goo the goo for these kind of places is made in a factory its made in a lab its just down-market goo but i can tell people its healthy and earth friendly and i can send my goo through a network of pipes running all the way to the ocean so that it can be eaten by people who eat crappy food anyway -- from coast to coast
and thats what we have for school lunch now thats what all the kids decided while i wasnt there
but you see it doesnt work unless i own all the crappy food places mr rancher
y-yes sir mr goo man
have you done what ive asked you to do
its all done sir youll have everything you need
well if you dont mind boys i have work to tend to
me too i need to have a word with the students at my school
oh god eric what are you gonna do
it has become the most popular burger in colorado the plant-based tegridy burger is changing the way people think about food all over the state people are turning vegan and eating more ethical sustainable meat
im standing now with randy marsh the owner of tegridy burger and mr marsh you must be pretty excited
yeah you know were all just -- were all just bein healthy and ethical over here
uh-huh and mr marsh what about the student protests coming out against your burger right now
huh
students are coming forward saying that tegridy farms is unethical and hypocritical
thats right tegridy burger is a fraud we caught their farm on camera just take a look
we warn you the following footage is graphic
huhuhuh
mr marsh what do you have to say about these images
oh hey fuck you oh they were -- they were just -- we didnt eat em
hey guys looks like i almost missed lunch
oh god someones gonna die
i found out about what were eating here at the school i found out what its made of and where
n-now eric stay calm mm-kay were sorry we were just trying to find a compromise now just be calm
what are you sorry about its me who owes all you guys an apology i thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy but ive learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods spaghettios rice-a-roni here i was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market i just didnt want my food to change school cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box and this is just processed crap that comes in a box i dont have a problem with it all i wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage i always have and this is definitely garbage and hey if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable well i guess im fine with that too so you see guys there was actually no reason to protest we were actually all on the same page all the time at least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesnt matter come on lets eat ♪ its processed meat-like substance day ♪ its processed meat-like substance day ♪
