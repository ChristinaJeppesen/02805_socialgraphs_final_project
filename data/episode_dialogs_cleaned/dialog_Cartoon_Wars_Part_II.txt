previously on south park
the popular cartoon family guy is going to show the image of mohammad uncensored
if we all bury our heads in sand we can avoid being any part of this
im gonna do whatever i can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand
you just want family guy off the air
kyle stop it
so long kyle
you son of a bitch i wont let you win
mr president theres something about the family guy writing staff i think you should know
and now the thrilling conclusion of cartoon wars will not be seen tonight so that we can bring you this terrance & phillip television special
say terrance isnt it wonderful having a holiday here at the lazy "j" ranch
it sure is phillip but i do believe this steer im riding has the farts
oh look whos coming isnt that mohammad the holy prophet of the muslim religion
hey guys hows it going
hello mohammad weve read all aboat you in the koran
im here to investigate a murder
all right just what the hell is going on here
you censored out the image of mohammad in our television special
ey you guys know the rules nobody can show the image of mohammad anymore its dangerous
but you ruined the whole show
look im not gonna risk the lives of the people at this network lets just forget aboat it okay guys aw come on guys give me a break
we demand you rerun mystery at the lazy "j" ranch with mohammad uncensored
ey i run this network not you guys and if you ask me your show has become so preachy and full of messages that youve forgotten how to be funny no mohammad
but family guy is going to show mohammad on an episode that airs tonight
i doubt it ill bet that right now somebody is on their way to fox network to demand that that episode be pulled
maam i need to speak to the president of this network right away
what is it regarding
its regarding family guy i demand that the mohammad episode be pulled before it airs tonight its incendiary its offensive to muslims and people can get hurt its wrong its wrooong
okay but if youve got a problem with family guy youll have to wait in line that little boy over there has an appointment to try and get family guy off the air altogether
dude can i go before you
eat my shorts
what the hell is going on hello excuse me i need to get to los angeles hello
starting in a small town in central colorado the idea has now spread all over america muslims continue to riot in the middle east demanding that family guy not air tonights episode amd muslim terrorists continue to make threats
"family guy" better not show mohammad tonight im serious "family guy" isnt funny
osama bin laden had this to say
if you look closely at the writing in "family guy" you will see that the jokes never derive from the plot and i think thats totally gay
bin laden went on to say that if family guy shows the image of mohammad as planned the terrorist retaliation will be immediate
you one of them
who
how come your head aint in the sand
so you dont like family guy either huh
i hate family guy
so whats your plan youre gonna ask the president of the network nicely to take it off the air
not nicely
look kid if you hate a tv show all you have to do is get an episode pulled pretty soon the show is compromised and it goes off the air
cool man
yes so my plan is to use this whole mohammad thing as a way to scare the network into pulling tonights show im going to use fear to get them to do what i want
isnt that like terrorism
no it isnt like terrorism it is terrorism
i could do that
this is manipulation at its highest level you should let me handle this
im a pretty bad kid
really whats the worst thing youve ever done
i stole the head off a statue once
wow thats pretty hardcore geez thats like this one time when i didnt like a kid so i ground his parents up into chili and fed it to him
you got it man you got it
seeya
i want to assure the american people that as president i have exhausted every possible solution unfortunately mohammad will appear uncensored on family guy tonight at seven
mr president
mr president cant the writers of the show be reasoned with dont they know theyre putting the country in danger
i have come to understand something about the family guy writing staff suffice it to say that they will not be persuaded by the possibility of violence
mr president
what exactly did you learn about the family guy writing staff mr president
im afraid that information is classified
awww mr president
mr president cant you force the family guy writing staff not to write anything about mohammad
couldnt you throw them in prison
look the fact of the matter is the family guy writing staff is protected by something called the first amendment
and what exactly is this first amendment mr president
uh you know the right to free speech
awww
mr president when your administration came up with this "first amendment" did it not foresee a problem like this might happen
well we didnt come up with the first amendment it was already in place
what do you intend to do about this "first amendment" mr president
forgive me mr president but this "first amendment" sounds like a lot of bureaucratic jibbery-joob
yeah
thats right
okay lets discuss the fall lineup
sir theres still one little boy out here who wants to speak with you about pulling the family guy episode
all right lets get this over with
hello gentlemen ladies my name is little danny pocket and i wont take much of your time please excuse my tiny crutch its the only way i can get around these days ow
oh poor kid
you see my father worked for a newspaper in my native country of denmark his newspaper showed an image of mohammad and two days later terrorists suicides bombed his building i was in the lobby when it happened first one terrorist suicide bombed us and then dozens more they just kept coming suicide bombers running in the building and blowing up one after another they were like mexican jumping beans i just dont wanna see people here at your studio getting hurt because that would be of course your responsibility ow
i feel terrible its so easy to put terrorism out of mind until one of its victims is staring you in the face
sir if we pull the episode the family guy writing staff will refuse to work again
little boy will you talk to the family guy writing staff if your story touches their hearts like it has ours perhaps theyll back down from demanding we air the episode
ill certainly do my best ow
take this noble child over to the family guy offices if he can scare them like he has us maybe we can pull the mohammad episode after all
yes and then family guy is as good as dead
what was that
i i said "thank you" thank you for listening
thanks a lot for the ride
ey its the least i could do i hope you succeed kid i really dont wanna see family guy go off the air i love that show
ill do everything i can
i mean i know its just joke after joke but i like that at least it doesnt get all preachy and up its own ass with messages you know
excuse me do you know which way the network presidents office is
who wants to know
look my fat bastard friend is trying to trick the network into getting family guy off the air
the network presidents office is in there
oh thanks dude
no problem man
hello this cant be right i- ow
cowabunga motherfucker
hello mitchell
oh hi miss travis
the president has asked that little danny pocket here speak with the family guy writing staff
are you sure theyre working on a new episode right now
it wont take long sir ow
all right ill take him back follow me little danny you must be excited not many people get to meet our writing staff
yes im totally excited family guy is so funny
well here we are danny the family guy writing staff
wha what are they
theyre manatees gretchen and flubber are from the gulf of mexico tinker pete and lucy are from the caribbean sea
family guy is written by manatees of course it all makes sense now
they really are brilliant creatures you see the right side of the tank is filled with idea balls each ball has a verb noun or pop culture reference written on it theres millions of them the manatees choose an idea ball and swim it over to the joke combine on the other side of the tank uh there goes gretchen shes comin up with an idea oh she came up with gary coleman the idea balls drop into the joke combine and form part of the new script laundry date winning mexico gary coleman a perfect family guy joke i can see it now
peter you didnt do the laundry today
you think thats bad remember the time i won a date to mexico with gary coleman
¿qué pasa señores
whatchoo talkin bout willis
waitwaitaminute waitaminute these manatees demanded that mohammad be shown how manatees dont talk
when fox censored the image of mohammad last week it also meant that the mohammad ball had to come out of the idea tank it made the manatees very upset pull just one idea ball out of the idea tank and the manatees stop working he-here ill show you keith all right all right put it back in manatees are very ethical writers either everythings okay to write about or nothing is anyway the president of the network wanted you to speak with the manatees
oh yes yes um hello manatees i i think you should allow the network to pull your episode with mohammad see im the victim of a a terrorist attack and terrorists might come after you if you-
that isnt gonna work on them
why not
dont you know anything about manatees theyre the only mammals that are completely unmoved by terrorst threats
son of a bitch
let me out of here kid why are you doing this
well well well
cartman
hello kyle looks like youve run into a little snag in your plan as well
you fat son of a bitch
you came so close to stopping me didnt you kyle there was just one thing you didnt count on that more people besides me hate family guy
yeah
well a lot of people like family guy too who are you to decide it shouldnt be on the air
shut up you shut your fucking face man did it work did you scare the network into pulling the episode
not yet but ive come up with a new plan ive learned how to make the family guy writing staff stop working as soon as everyone goes on their lunch break i can sneak back in
cool man
cartman let me out of this stupid net
good kyle thats good anger youre showin there see that thats emotional character development based on whats happening in the storyline not at all like family guy now if youll excuse me kyle ive got some idea balls to remove from a manatee tank
what
i dont understand it whats wrong with them
we dont know mr president they just stopped working
but nobody took any idea balls out of the tank did they
no sir none of us did
then why are they refusing to write i agreed to show mohammad uncensored i did what you asked what do you want from me
sir sir if you dont my saying i think you asked for this you gave in to the manatees last week now they know all they have to do is refuse to work and they can get whatever they want you spoiled them by caving in now they thnk they can walk all over you sir you are in charge of this network not them maybe its time you showed them whos in charge
youre right its time i stop letting these primadonna manatees tell me what to do im pulling the mohammad episode you got that and if you all dont want to work tomorrow you can just find other jobs how long before family guys supposed to air
twenty-five minutes
i gotta hurry

family guy is going off the air no more family guy for me mon frère
cartmaaaan you fucking fatass
how the hell did you get out
that kid and i had a long talk i told him he was on a slippery slope to becoming a monster like you
aw god damnit you gave him one of your gay little speeches didnt you
you are not killing family guy
youre too late kyle the president of the network is pulling the episode family guy is as good as dead
theres still time to tell the network president youre full of crap
i cant let you do that
get out of my way or ill kick your ass

network control this is the president i want you to pull the episode
what mr president are you sure
im sure begin episode jettison sequence 0 2 900
abort system initiated
awaiting confirmation
mr president we need your final approval code
president approval code 0-0-destruct-
sir mister television executive stop
who are you
listen to me the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child he only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of family guy forever
the end of family guy
mr president we need final authorization
hold on julie what are you talking about kid
pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction youll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely its what happened to laverne & shirley
you mean the manatees arent trying to run the network
what manatees
go ahead mr president continue what you were doing
no you have to show mohammad mr president
mr president were awaiting your orders
sir just think about what youre doing to free speech
no think about the people who could get hurt
ah i dont know who to listen to
okay ill make it easy for you pull the mohammad episode now
okay ill listen to you julie
noo wait you cant listen to him hes a lying deceitful monster who only wants family guy off the air
but he has a gun
you cant do what he wants just because hes the one threatening you with violence
shut up kyle
i cant be responsible for people getting hurt especially me
yes people can get hurt thats how terrorism works but if you give into that doug youre allowing terrorism to work do the right thing here
give the orders to pull the episode mr president
i shouldnt even be in the office still its supposed to be half-day friday
mr president thirty seconds to airtime what do you want us to do
do the right thing mr president
how about i allow the episode to air but just censor out the image of mohammad again
i wish that was good enough but if you censor out mohammad then soon youll have to censor out more
no gay speeches kyle
if you dont show mohammad then youve made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at and what isnt either its all okay or none of it is
five seconds mr president
do the right thing show mohammad do the right thing
mr president we need a decision now
family guy goes on air as planned uncensored
yes
no no i hate family guy
air it
peter you got a pink slip at work
you think thats bad remember the time i got a salmon helmet from mohammad while wearing a toga
coming mohammad
wow a salmon helmet thanks
anyway what were we talking about
oh yeah my pink slip
hey that wasnt bad at all they just showed mohammad standin there lookin normal
mr president the terrorists are retaliating
what
or the time i-
as soon as the image of mohammad appeared terrorist leader al-zawahri announced the retaliation
we warned you not to show mohammad- but "family guy" did it anyways so now here is our retaliation on america
hello i am american
