i think im going to name it gorak
no dude we have to name it steve

its my name and i found him
you didnt find him i found him
what are you talking about dude i fell down that abyss and there it was
you wouldnt even have noticed it if i hadnt pointed it out
kenny who found the ice man
(well i think you guys should name it steve)
i think were almost there you guys
aalll right people the next order of business is a very serious matter we need to vote on whether south park should reinstate the death penalty or not all those in favor say "yippee"
yippee
wait what was that i missed the question yippee
all those opposed say "nay"
nay
screw you
ey screw you
huh excuse me
not now kids the town is having a very important debate on capital punishment
but we found a frozen ice man from the past
i found this frozen guy in the woods today
no i found this frozen guy in the woods today
what the hell is going on here
we came for our reward
yeah like the kid with the wallet
reward what reward
mayor i think the boys may have stumbled onto something here you see mayor frozen links are often found dinosaur eggs woolly mammoths this specimen could be a missing link in our evolution if i can unfreeze the body and perform an autopsy i could learn much about this creatures people and its time
sure sure sure be my guest knock your socks off
thank you mayor oh and boys i i cant give you a reward for finding this creature but if youd like ill let you name him
really
sweet how about steve
steve it is
wait a minute his name is gorak
come on steve weve got work to do unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work well have to use the most advanced methods available
this is very exciting he could be a neanderthal or an australopithecus from the paleolithic era do you see that kevin these clothes are from eddie bauer i havent seen anybody wear clothes from eddie bauer since 1996 this is incredible think of all we can learn from this body all that it can teach us lets just hope the press doesnt get wind of this right away
stand back people theres nothing to see here
what about the prehistoric ice man
oh yeah there is that
dr mephesto could you please tell us whats going on
ladies and gentlemen we still have a lot of work to do but it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months yes its true although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes
fascinating news tonight from south park an ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually frozen in ice a team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied and studied the caveman was discovered by kyle broflovski who had this to say
well i fell down this ice cavern and i saw this block of ice so i told my friend to throw a rope-
the prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-jurassic era where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on waterston street
thats it kevin now we can begin the autopsy
uuuurrr
ugh whats this
mmmmm
holy crap hes alive
thats impossible do an ekg on him
uugh
my god he really is alive the ice must have preserved him
well quick do something
no no weve got to think this through mayor this man has not been conscious for almost three years he wont understand what he sees hell be frightened and confused
well you just cant let him die
perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time
uh ughn
oh my god it looks as if hes about to speak
where where am i
what
whats he saying
is that english
what youre youre hungry
where am i
youre youre hungry
whats goin on
me friend friieend me friend ma-phes-to mah-phehs-to
huh
hawgh if we could understand what hes saying then maybe we could get some answers if only there was someone who could communicate with him on a level as primitive as his own a mind like a child
dude i wanted to call him gorak
goraks a gay name
no it isnt
why are you being such a dick
im not being a dick youre being a dick
nuh-uh
hello children dr mephesto needs one of you to help him out in his lab with the prehistoric ice man
ill go
no ill go i found him
damn ive never seen you guys fight like this
all right theres only one fair way to do this everyone stick out their potatoes my mother and your mother were out hanging clothes my mother punched your mother in the nose what color blood came out
(blue)
b l o o uh oh-o spells "blue" and that means that you will go to the lab and help out mephesto and then we can all go home and watch murphy brown
steve you-
where am i
steeve steeeve steeeve oh good youre here
oh my god they revived gorak
you bastards
yes and i need you to communicate with him see if you can understand what hes saying
uh hi
hi
whatd he say
he said "hi"
very interesting
where am i
what
he wants to know where he is
tell him tell him hes home
youre home
in the year 1999
its 1999
hes been frozen for the last 32 months
dude youve been frozen 32 months
and we found you-
what thirty-two months
all right all right all-
aaaa
all right all right calm down
aaaaaaa
i think thats enough for today
whoa oh
good job dude you freaked him out
oh shut up assmaster youre just jealous cause they had me talk to him
guess what youre not my best friend anymore cartmans my new best friend
sweet
oh yeah well youre not my best friend anymore either cartman is now my best friend
killer
fine
fine
fine
are you alphonse mephesto
the same
we understand that you are currently in possession of the prehistoric ice man from 1996
thats right
we would like to we would like to offer our services in your experiments
oh where are you gents from
we are from the university of america
well theres not a lot to see but come in hes still not responding much to us the shock is still settling in but weve made great progress now that hes in the habitat
habitat
yes kevin and i designed a habitat for steve to live in that is completely like his own world everything is 1996-oriented
amazing he looks so much like us
yes well kevin has done a lot of work in figuring out just how related to us steve really is he came up with this drawing
dr mephesto we realize that scientific study is expensive we want to help you make this project more lucrative
how would we do that
its easy
as you can see the ice man is listening to ace of base which was a very popular group during his era and primitive drumming soothed his peoples tempers
he doesnt look very happy in there
no he sure doesnt
i wasnt talking to you buttpipe i was talking to cartman
well i was talking to cartman too
damn im pretty freakin cool all of a sudden
ah here we see the ice man trying to gain internet access on the computer the internet was still not very big in his time so the web frightens and confuses him its okay he cant hurt you its one-way glass he cant even see us and now the ice man watches television
this grizzly bear has the strength of over ten morgan freemans im really pissing him off right now
wait this could be dangerous
how so
hes changing the channel something on the television could frighten and confuse him
and theyve done it the atlanta falcons are going to the super bowl
what rrrowrrr
you guys arent being very nice to my creature
hes my creature
hes fine boys and were learning so much from him
let him out dude hes scared
he would be more scared on the outside do you think this stuff freaks him out how do you think hed react to whats happening in the government right now
but it isnt right
little boy sometimes whats right isnt as important as whats profitable
(uh oh ow)
oh my god they killed kenny
what im not talking to you
gorak gorak gorak are you there
oh hi what are you doing here viewing hours are 10 to 6
