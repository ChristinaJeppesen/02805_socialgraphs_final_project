doctor mr kleins test results came in

anybody got more of that loompa loompa weed
wow those guys have nice balls
wish my man had balls like those
mmm
our entire production is headquartered here boys we move over sixteen tons of chicken every month of course with the new laws in colorado my business has taken quite a hit im worried other states might follow suit
we know colonel but we can get your chicken into the state we just need a bulk deal say four ninety five a key
ive got to hand it to you colonel you have everything a man could want
i like you eric theres no lying in you unfortunately i dont feel the same about your friend
who you mean tommy wait whered he go
your partner is an informant for jamie oliver
dude that was sweet hes all choked
and how do i know youre not a liar too
hey colonel ive been your biggest supporter since i was two years old i love your chicken i love you
i think you and me can work this thing out eric do business together a long time
good
just remember i only tell you one time dont fuck me eric dont you ever try to fuck me
randy randy will you look at yourself your balls are getting bigger
i know theyre pretty swollen kinda hurts im gonna buy some more weed
randy please when you get back do you think maybe we could make love again

hey uh could you uh give me half a pound of that suburban sunrise please
im sorry sir but you have to be inside the store
well eh im right here can you just bring it over
selling medicinal marijuana outside the confines of an approved shop is still illegal
look im startin to feel kind of stupid can i please get high
what are you crazy eric making a deal with the colonel for ten thousand more boxes i cant move that much chicken
will you relax billy its fine
fine im not making any money here im losing it i have to pay for more security i got the cops up my ass and i have to pay for all these orders to cut the chicken for distribution
billy billy weve gotta be thinking bigger here its time to expand
how can i expand when thirty-six percent of our product is going to you get out there and sell the chicken or get lost youve forgotten who the boss of this operation is eric
yeah welll youre not gonna be around a lot longer
what is that supposed to mean
i told your mom you got an f on that social studies test
you wouldnt do that
does a bear crap in the woods and does the pope crap on the broken lives and dreams of two hundred deaf boys
billy your father and i want to talk to you
bye bye billy alright everyone listen up im in charge now anybody got a problem with that alright good
what do we want
bigger doors
where do we want them
weed stores
what do we want
bigger doors
where do we want them
weed stores
look im sorry but the bill says i cant modify any existing structure
well i guess we could change the law to allow for medicinal marijuana to be sold just outside the door of the shop
egah i dont know maybe the rule should be somebody can buy the medicinal weed for others
look cant we skip all this and just make pot legal everyone is just abusing this medicinal system anyway its ridiculous
whats ridiculous about it
hold on hold people people please we are all forgetting what is really at issue here look around these men all have cancer its no coincidence that when this building changed the rise in cancer went up dont you see the kfc was keeping people healthy
mr cartman come on were supposed to be handling the business youre eating too much of the stuff
shut up kevin im the boss not you buttlicker
eric the colonel is on the phone for you he sounds pissed
what oh thats right i forgot to- dammit uh okay put him on speaker
hello hello
colonel how are you doing
what happened
oh we had some problems you know colonel
eric what happened
we had a little problem
i heard
yeah howd howd you hear that
because jamie oliver gave his speech at the un today he was not supposed to give that speech eric
hey thats okay well get him next time
theres not going to be a next time you fucking dumb cocksucker
hey take it easy colonel
i told you a long time ago you fucking little monkey not to fuck me
hey hey who the fuck do you think youre talking to huh huh oh crap
freeze
its the cops
run billy run
mommy no
last november this town passed a bill that seemed silly to some since then weve had underground black markets crime death and shootings but now the bill has been repealed and i am relieved to announce that once again marijuana is illegal
and another bill has been repealed as well because ever since we got rid of kfc weve seen a great rise in cancer but today we welcome back kfc and all the medical benefits it gives us
well i got to admit its a lot easier to get in doors with my little prosthetic balls
yeah great
aw sharon dont be upset the doctor made you a souvenir
randy i love it
and when it gets cold it shrinks
sharon you got a scrotum coat
yyyup
luckyyyyy
