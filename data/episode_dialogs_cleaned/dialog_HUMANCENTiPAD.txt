to fulfill the agreement can we get a weight please
83 pounds sir
what "agreement"
83 pounds good lets get the bloodwork
hey you cant do that
you agreed we could take all the blood we needed
what are you talking about
when you downloaded the last itunes update a window on your screen popped up and asked you if you agreed to our terms and conditions you clicked "agree" alright lets get him to the water tank
the water tank hey im not going with you
youve agreed to all of this hey
you guys you gotta help me these business casual g-men are trying to kidnap me
what
its crazy dude theyre saying its because i agreed to the latest terms and conditions on itunes
why what did the terms and conditions for the last update say
i dont know i didnt read them
you didnt read them
who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up
i do
me too
youre telling me that every time you guys download an update for itunes you read the entire terms and conditions
of course
well how do you know if you agree to something if you dont read it
well i turned off all my apple stuff they cant locate you if you dont have your stuff on right
there he is hey you
gahhh
dad dad i need a lawyer
kyle what are you doing here
dad if you agree to something but you didnt mean to agree to it what do you do
well kyle its always the agreeing partys responsibility to know what they are signing
but its like eight pages long and they send me a new one like every three weeks how can they know if i-
calm down kyle its okay youre safe with daddy
here he is
aahh
come on you
hey what the heck is going on
your son has made a binding and legal agreement with apple sir
an agreement to do what
apples inner workings are top secret to all users you know how it is
no i dont know how it is i use a pc
you what
come on lets go
hey now let him go
dad you tasered my dad
you said we could
okay wifi+3g 64 gigs this one this one
oh sweetie $900
i cant wait to see the look on kyles stupid face when he sees my ipad has more memory than his
eric we cant afford that one
well you dont expect me to get the wifi-only 16-gig version do you
i think we need to get you a different brand hon theyre a little cheaper
mom everyone knows that everything but apple is stupid
here look at this one toshiba handibook
toshiba handibook
this says it does everything the ipad does at half the price
mom do not screw me over again if i take that thing to school everyone is gonna think im a poverty-stricken asshole
eric stop acting like a spoiled brat you can either have the toshiba handibook or you can have nothing at all
oh ive got a better idea why dont you go across the street and buy some condoms because we should at least be safe if youre gonna fuck me mom
eric
you might as well go buy some cigarettes too because i like to have a smoke after i get good and fucked do you wanna fuck me mom just say so go ahead here huh go ahead mom fuck me fuck me right here in the best buy you wanna fuck your son so bad go on mom fuck me fuck me
stop crying eric i told you if you kept acting up you werent getting anything
but i told you i was sorry
you made me look like some sort of child molester in front of all those people
i wasnt trying to get you in trouble
then why did you go outside to a police officer and say "help help my mom is trying to fuck me"
oh wait i get it now the f-word is a no-no word and i shouldnt say it around other people im sorry mama
if youre really sorry then youll understand why you arent getting anything
well now that doesnt really have any logical sense mommy because im already being punished by not getting the ipad mama please can we just go back and get the toshiba handibook
no
well then can we at least pull up here and get some dinner cause i like to be wined and dined after ive been fucked
what are you going to do to us
what is this whats going on
you you agreed to the itunes terms and conditions too
what
i just clicked "agree" i didnt read it i was in a hurry you see and i i i didnt know what i was agreeing to
(in japanese accent) i cant even read engrish
hey shut up in there you all agreed to stay quiet
hey hey let me out of here this is a mistake i agreed by accident
you cant agree by accident theres a fail-safe built-in even if you click on "agree" another little window pops up that says "are you sure you agree" and you have to click on "agree" again
uh what are you going to do to us
everything that you agreed to in the itunes conditions
we didnt read them
heh riiight who just agrees to something they dont read
and now the president of apple steve jobs
hello everyone im here to announce a new product that will once again revolutionize the way we use our phones and tablet devices lets hear it for our volunteers these three people have agreed to be brought here handcuffed to these beds and become the prototype of our first truly-interfaced device
the first what
they have actually agreed to be surgically altered their lips will be removed and they will be sewn together mouth to anus
what
you agreed to this mouth to anus so that the feces so that the gastral tract from one will enter the mouth of the little boy - and he agreed this was okay - enter the mouth of the little boy leading through his anus to the mouth of the female - who completely agreed they all agreed - which will then go to a tablet device making a product that is part human and part centipede and part web browser and part emailing device i give you the humancentipad
(in japanese accent) oho i should habu never appudeitedo itunes
"you agree that apple may charge your credit card or paypal account for any products purchased in the itunes store"
can somebody please explain to me what is going on
were trying to find out exactly what kyle agreed to
there cant be anything in that agreement that allows a company to do what theyre talking about to kyle
hold up here it is right here "by clicking agree you are also acknowledging that apple may sew your mouth to the butthole of another itunes user"
oh boy
"apple and its subsidiaries may also if necessary sew yet another persons mouth onto your butthole making you a being that shares one gastral tract" hmmm im gonna click onnn "decline"
well that does it im going to the police
for what
to find out where apple is keeping my son
dude when the police wanna know where somebody is they ask apple the only way we can fix all this is by going to the highest authority on the planet you guys were gonna have to ask help from the geniuses
the geniuses
(the geniuses)
