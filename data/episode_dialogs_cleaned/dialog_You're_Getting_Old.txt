ive told you what i think of this music stanley you have plenty of other gifts to enjoy
looks like somebodys on the rag huh mom
sharon stan told me you took away his music cd at his birthday party
oh for crying out loud i gave him a great party and thats all he cares about
well do you really think we should be telling our son what music he can and cant listen to
yes i do if its that stupid tween wave garbage
tween wave
you havent heard it its terrible its hardly even music it just sounds like crap
sharon come on dont you remember being younger and having our parents say the music we liked sounded like crap
this is different
so here we are now were the old people who think the younger generations music sounds like shit
its not because im older im telling you our music is better
"back in my day our music was better not this garbage the young un listen to warber warber warber"
fine randy you go listen to it and tell me you dont think it sounds like crap
id love to im not an old fuddy-duddy sharon im still cool
well it sounds like crap right
uh no i mean i like it
oh come on that music sounds like shit
no its just young and hip so you dont get it sharon
admit it randy you think it sounds like crap too
it doesnt sound like crap at all i think its awesome
its called tween wave and if youre a parent your kids are probably listening to it a new music genre for the era from 2009 through 2012 or "the tweens" every generation has their music but many parents say tween wave sounds like crap
its just vulgar and stupid you know music used to be good
this sounds like poo
i certainly dont understand kids music today sounds like diarrhea to me
kids however say they dont hear crap at all
parents are dumb
they dont get it
they dont get it parents are stupid
tween wave is swick
tweem wave is super swick and parents dont get it cause their ears are old
parents are dumb
were sorry boys but we have all decided that as of now none of you are allowed to listen to tween wave music
ugh thats so unfair
but thats our music we like it
yeah its good
whats good about a bunch of crap sounds to a drumbeat
we dont know what youre talking about it doesnt sound that way to us
yeah it it doesnt sound like that to us
i wanna educate you kids with some real music this is the police now you compare this to tween pop and tell us which one you think is real music
yuck
what
that sounds like shit
whattaya mean it sounds like shit this doesnt sound like shit
gross
turn it off dude
stanley i want you to understand that even though i wont let you listen to certain kinds of music i still love you
i know mom i love you too
soon youll be old enough to make your own choices but for now i just dont want you listening to that stuff
its okay mom i understand
thats very mature of you stanley goodnight sweetie
night haha ugh what the hell
oh dude dude this is the part i was talking about check out the bassline on this
oh yeah that ones cool yeah this parts killer
hey stan
hey dudes
dude have you really listened to the sixth track i think its my new favorite
yeah yeah ive listened to it um kyle can i talk to you alone for a second
sure whats up
kyle i have to admit something to you you know how i told you over the phone i like the new gersploosh album i lied i dont like it i dont like it at all kyle
oh really um well thats okay
no you dont understand dude somethings happened tween wave doesnt sound the same to me
why whats it sound like
it kind of sounds like shit
what you mean like you dont like the singing or the lyrics or what
no i mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears please just listen really close you dont hear shit
no
that doesnt sound like shit to you
no dude maybe you should see a doctor
and so then i put on exactly the same album that i really like a year ago and it sounded like shit to me
uh huh and what about food are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now too
yeah i used to love these pop rock things and i tried them the other day and i thought they tasted like shit
this says you had a birthday recently
i just turned 10
well that makes sense you see stan as you get older your eardrums taste buds all that stuff develops and changes
so this is normal
its very normal lets just do a quick ear exam im gonna play some tween wave music and you tell me what you hear whats that sound like to you
sounds like shit
aha now im going to play you some good ole bob dylan
uh that sounds like shit too
wait this sounds like shit to you
yeah dude its just shit
well thats very strange hm im gonna try somethin else look at these two pictures one of them is an ad for kevin james new movie the zookeeper and the other is a turd in a microwave which one is the ad for the zookeeper
they both look the same
you dont see any difference in the pictures
no
that is an ad for the zookeeper and that is a turd about to be reheated
they both look like turds about to be reheated to me
oh dear i think i know what this is you see stan as you get older things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit and things that seemed shitty as a child dont seem as shitty with you somehow the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you its a condition called "being a cynical asshole"
oh no
yes and theres no known cure im afraid everything just seems shitty and everyone starts to seem shitty and everything they say just starts to
randy do you mind cleaning up the garage like i asked you
get out of my room im listening to my music gau
stop pretending to like the kids music randy its pathetic you know damn well it sounds like crap to you too
no it doesnt sound like crap to me ugh
randy dont you see what this is you had dreams of being a rock star when you were younger now you cant admit the next generations music sounds shitty its called "getting older" randy its okay
thats not true i think tween wave music is complex and awesome and it speaks to my youthful rebellious spirit sharon
its crap randy its so simple and stupid that anybody could play it
anybody could play it do you really think so
