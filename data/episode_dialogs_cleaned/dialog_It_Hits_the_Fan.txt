do you really think anythings gonna be any different now do you really think that this will have the tiniest smallest effect on the world its still the same old world out there look what the hell
whoa dude its raining frogs
oh whatever
last night the daring and bold show cop drama broke new ground by saying "shit" on television making "shit" officially okay to say around the country a recent poll shows that 24% of americans think the show has pushed the envelope too far while a whopping 76% say they dont really give a shit in other news a strange virus which causes victims to vomit up their intestines is making life shitty for a small farming community rick watts has the story
thanks tom shit is certainly going down here in the small town-
whoa shit
alright children in lieu of the common usage im sposed to clarify the schools position on the word "shit"
wow we can say "shit" in school now
this is ridiculous just because they say it on tv its alright
yes but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form
huh
you can only use it in the non-literal sense for instance "thats a shitty picture of me" is now fine hoever the literal noun form of "this is a picture of shit" is still naughty
i dont get it
me neither
the adjective form is now also acceptable for example "the weather outside is shitty" however the literal adjective is not appropriate for example "my bad diarrhea made the inside of the toilet bowl shitty and i had to clean it with a rag which then also became shitty" thats right out
ssssss shit
very good timmy
uh ms choksondik eh can we say it in the expletive like "oh shit" or "shit on a shingle"
yes thats now fine
wow this is gonna be great a whole new word
its not new im gonna look "shit" up in the encyclopedia and prove it
dont mind kyle everyone hes just got a little sand in his vagina
theres no sand in my vagina
boys watch your language shit
and so children instead of saying "hand in your papers" i may now say "hand in your shit" any questions
what about "i have to take a shit"
no no filmore you can say "i have to poop and shit" or "oh shit i have to poop" but not "i have to shit" are we all clear
no
look its all about context well for example recently i have come out and admitted that i was a homosexual im gay that means that now i can say the word "fag" on television they usually dont allow "fag" but because im gay its alright and with the new approval of the word "shit" that means that finally i am free to sayhey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you do oh this is great
why that store has such lovely shit
yeah too bad i dont have shit for cash right now
oh looks like the weather might turn shitty
oh i dont really give a shit ive done enough shit outside today and shit
shit peter you look like shit
no shit i feel like shit i think i-
holy shit
did you see that shit
what kind of shit is this
that is some weird shit
susan your shits ready
do you know where this shit goes
shit if i know
nice going shit-for-brains
old mcdonald took a shit e i e i o
no shit
hey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there-
oh shit scuse me
hey watch it fag
what did you call me
i called you a fag because im gay and that means im free to use the word "fag" so piss off you fag-shitter heh so hey there shity shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag ba doop a doop doo
this sucks now that "shit"s out it isnt fun to say it anymore
yeah theyve taken all the fun out of "shit" were gonna have to start saying other bad words like cock and fuck and meecrob
whats meecrob
you know that stuff you get as an appetizer at thai food restaurants meecrob dude is way grosser than "shit" dude id scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before i ate another plate of meecrob
you guys you guys ive looked up the word "shit" i think it might have something to do with people dying
what
havent you noticed everyone getting sick it all started when they said "shit" on television
oh kyle you are so full of meecrob
i am not full of meecro- what look the word "shit" first showed up in english in the 1340s the same time as something called "the black death"
whats that
kyle do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to the lion king with you i mean shit dude let it go
look it might be a coincidence but i think wed better ask someone come on
seventy-five share my god i never thought it was possible
sir your "shit" idea has turned the entire network around were proud to work for you
sir id just like to take this opportunity and im sure i speak for all of us when i say you are the most creative genius in hollywood and well id let you have me if you wanted
thanks roger but ive only just started you see ive already figured out our new marketing scheme technique for the next run of shows
whoa
hes unstoppable
whats the new idea
i can hardly wait
im about to piss myself
this saturday on hbc were going to say "shit" twice
twice
brilliant
think of the repetition
its like saying it once but double
well gentlemen lets get on it
ho
baby you are so fine and shitthe shit you do the shit you say id jump on your shit any day oh hello there children
hey chef
chef do you know where "shit" comes from
uh from your ass children
no no the word "shit"
oh
detective sandy vagina here thinks that "shit" might have something to do with everyone getting sick
ungh it said in my book that the word "shit" started exactly the same time as something called "the black death"
the black death are you sure
whats the black death chef
latoya jackson children
oh
but i think back in those days it meant something else the plague
it says here the word "shit" has been around for over 600 years it comes from the anglo-saxon word "skite"
right but in the 1340s people in england stopped calling it "skite" and started calling it "shit" the same year as the black plague
this is the oldest book in the library a priceless original of englands history just about everything you could want to know about the plague is in this great tome oh shit well this other book has some good information too
the black plague over half of europe was killed by it
look theyre puking out their intestines just like the people here
look at this children it says that the people in england believed that the plague was a curse a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse
word of curse
a curse word
of course ive never even thought about why we use the term "curse word" before
because it brings a curse like the black death
you guys look here in this nancy drew mystery nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe this could explain how kyle got it in his vagina
cartman this is serious
so am i kyle if that sand in your vagina doesnt get released you could become a walking time bomb
if you dont mind ill have to close up now theyre going to say "shit" seven times on hbc and i-
holy shit
oh-ho gross
dude this plague is spreading like wildfire
uh oh
(uh oh)
kennys got it heh heh
weve gotta do something chef if we dont we dont stop that network "shit" will become an even more acceptable word
children weve got to warn those producers in hollywood that the plague and "shit" could be linked
hello ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking if you look out the right side of the aircraft you can see some interesting shit and over on the left side theres some interesting shit too well we should be arriving in los angeles in about two hours until then we invite you to sit back relax and enjoy our shitty service
goddamn it kenny dont get your plague germs on me
cartman stop being an asshole
the ratings are in sir we broke another record last night with the show that said "shit" seven times
where is the roof on this thing i mean i mean how can we top ourselves now
gentlemen i have it the end-all greatest marketing ploy of all time tonight on hbc we will air all our sitcoms live and have everyone say "shit" in place of their written lines and well call it "must shit tv"
bravo
"night of a million shits"
now doing this live will be difficult so we must-
hold on a minute mr producer
who are you
my name is chef and these are the children weve come to warn you about "shit"
oh brother another christian protest group
who wants to take this one
ill get it gentlemen we appreciate your concern here at hbc the general goal is providing the highest and most thought-provoking entertainment how great it is that we live in a country where an artist can express himself freely thats not only the american spirit its the hbc spirit which allows us to make great family programs like halo the turtle and of course everyones favorite show cop drama we cant thank you enough for bringing your concerns to our network for it is you the loyal hbc viewer who makes this great network and indeed the great country that it is
alright now as i was saying-
hey hold on a minute
aw are they still here
havent you people noticed all the strange things going on
we think that you might have caused it by helping make "shit" an everyday word
hm right right
its true we think that word might be plaguing our friend kenny
do you have any proof of this
no
then get out of here before we have you thrown out
but we can keep the halo the turtle dolls right
damn cracker-ass producers
now what are we gonna do chef
i dont know children i guess weve got to get the word out to people some other way
aaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh
oh shit
stand aside
alright now we have to get all our biggest names to say "shit" and then were gonna-
halt your evil plans
huh
i possess the rune stone of undoing who is in charge here
oh no you guys didnt hire me a stripper for my birthday- oh tell me you guys didnt
show your true form geldon lest you be afraid your short time in this world is at an end ach the rune stone has no effect you are not geldon
i never said i was
you will die anyway for you have spread the word of curse
security
ach oh
who are you
take this
what are we supposed to do with it
eeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
now what
weve got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about children were goin to have to go to the land of castles knights and kings
lords and ladies we bid you welcome to the grandest casino in the land excalibur
take a free spin double your odds
scuse me do you work here
how can i help you noble sir
we need some help identifying an ancient english stone
a what
it might hold the key to a curse
uh i can help get you some credit or a comp meal perhaps
dude we need help from the british
look kid this is just a casino i cant help you you know not every british person knows about wizards and dragons and curses
we just need help identifying this
the rune stone of gaelic where did you get this
you know what it is
the skire once spoke of such a stone come we must see the sorcerer
get ready for "must shit tv" starting now four straight hours of pure shit its all live
hey heh shit heh ya aint shit
yeah dude ya aint shit
this is it my greatest work
cocktails cocktails
these americans wish to see the skire
let us make haste to the inner sanctum
how could you foolish americans bring the wrath of scorn by mass-chanting the word of wretchedness
uh yeah we didnt mean to
didnt you realize "shit" is a curse word
well yeah but i dont think that we knew "curse word" meant curse word
ha leave it to americans to think that "no" means yes "pissed" means angry and "curse word" means something other than a word thats cursed
let me see the stone
but i dont get it people use curse words all the time
saying a word of curse once in a while does nothing its only when spoken repeatedly and en masse that the curse takes place
ive seen this before stones that were used by the knights of standards and practices
knights of standards and practices
a legion of men sworn to do whatever necessary to keep the words at bay but they were just a myth
you know what youre dumb as shit
oh yeah well i dont really give a shit
ya know that words kind of getting old its not really funny anymore
yeah theyre gonna have to come up with a new swear word soon
well they cant use "fag" because you cant say "fag" unless youre a homosexual
really so we cant say fag
no see you got beeped
you mean you have to be a fag to say fag
thats right
well thats not fair i should be able to say "fag"
hey you didnt get beeped
uh oh
well well well guess we learned something new about you jimbo you frickin fag you wanna make out or something
oh man i am up shit creek
serves you right shit-for-brains
yeah how could i be such a dumb sh-
say not the word of curse
what the
holy shit
oh boy this show is really reaching for plot now
the knights were formed to keep curse words to a minimum should a curse word ever be let out they would return a rune for each word of curse was made representing each of the eight words that so offended god
look theres the f-word
and asshole
i knew it meecrob meecrob is a curse word god must hate it as much as i do
look at this the writing here claims this stone can defeat the evil geldon who will rise when the word of curse has been said enough times to give him power then all the world will be destroyed
all the world destroyed
my house too
oh no
what
tonight is the "night of a million shits" on hbc its gonna be said over and over
then we havent much time we must go
turn off those devices of broadcast
what is going on here stop this shit
we are the royal order of standards and practices
we command you to stop saying the curse word
listen mr shinypants i am the head of this network and i will say "shit" all i want shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit shit oh shit
and now back to must shit tv here on hbc
he is too strong we cannot fight him without the rune stone
my my god sir what have you unleashed upon the world
i didnt know i didnt know
i i cant follow this shitty storyline at all
wait
oh boy that thing has really got sand in its vagina
the rune stone point it towards geldon
agh dude lame lame bummer dudes
what a stupid voice
its okay the curse has been lifted
yeah we all gotta make sure it doesnt come back
you see weve learned something today swearing can be fun but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems
were all saying the s-word too much
kyle
look gerald kyles on television
uh huh
the knights of standards and practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum "curse words" theyre called that because they are a curse we have to go back to only using curse words in rare extreme circumstances
and besides too much use of a dirty word takes away from its impact we believe in free speech and all that but keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of english
so please everyone from now on youve got to try and watch your language
yeah
that makes sense
aint that right
is this still part of the show
were sorry noble knights of standards and practices from now on we will obey your laws
see that you do
im very proud of you children lets all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to
yeah and kenny didnt die
(yeah i didnt-
holy shi- poop
hah i love you guys
