joining me now is father maxi from the south park church father what do you think of all the preparations here at the docks
halloween is an abomination of god a celebration of the occult-eh
yeah and how about korn playing the big concert tomorrow pretty exciting huh
korn is a devil-worshiping group that plays violent music if we allow that demon band to play on this most unholy of holidays we may incur the full wrath of evil
alriight well see you tomorrow for halloween in the meantime heres a kozy hit by barry manilow
come on you guys think how can we scare the fifth graders it has to be something reeaally scary
we could get a big scary plastic spider and dangle it in front of them on a string s- spooky spider thats pretty scary
thats not scary fatass
well come on we can think of something better than stupid pirate ghosts

hold on kids
mrs broflovski
yes
were from mt peaceful cemetery could we have a word with you
eehh sure come in what is it
ms broflovski somebody has defiled your mothers grave
defiled how
well im afraid that somebody dug her up
dug her up why
well the- most likely reason is that somebody wanted to have sex with her dead body
yeahp
what
uhuh we dont want to upset you but it happens somebodys probably making love to her corpse as we speak
every vile position every disrespectful act imaginable
hoh dear god
yes by now hes probably even removed her eyes and made love to the empty sockets as well
oooh
no- we dont want to upset you but you should know that your mothers body would be stiff and dry so he would have to have it soaked in warm water for several hours before making love to it
o-o-o-o-oh
yes and now for the difficult part
brace yourself
it is highly possible that he has created new orifices in her decomposing flesh leaving her to look something like — an overloved hunk of swiss cheese she probably-
okay okay i get the point just tell me what youre gonna do about it
do
oh we dont do anything were just the watchmen
yeah i guess maybe you might wanna call the police or something
o-o-ogh
now he probably would make love to the dead body in a cool dry place so as not to allow further decomposition
package delivery for mrs cartman
a package oh really well i think i can sign for that
sign heah and heah and heah
i got a christmas present i got a christmas present maybe i can see what it is ill just open one little corner lets see here thats good ill rewrap it later oh sweet life-sized blow-up antonio banderas love doll with realistic geni-ta-lia oh this kicks ass what a cool christmas present my mom got

no grandma
nno grandma

well shes not here thats just great thanks a lot stan youre gonna get me busted again
okay people i know we all want to get down to the docks for the halloween haunt but first we just need to inform you about thee- people or persons out there digging up bodies to have sex with them gentlemen
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen a person who steals bodies to have sex with them is called a necrophiliac so that you all know what to expect my partner alan has a sketch of what having sex with a dead body might look like
ee-oooh
yes we know its horrible its probably best you not look at it now alan will demonstrate what having sex with a dead body might sound like
awwwgh
excuse me how is this helping
thats it folks now we can all go to the docks and enjoy the halloween haunt
noo dont go to the docks aarrrgh argh im captain bly you land-lubbers had better stay away from the docks or else therell be hell to pay fire the cannon har harharharhar
arrrgh
we wont warn ya again stay away from our docks
i warned you i told you this would happen when you allow bands like korn to come to town and play your hedonistic halloween concerts this is what you get
great rehearsal gang that was really groovy lets practice one more time before the show starts
aah guys im sorry but the halloween haunts been cancelled
cancelled
you best clear out of here theres pirate ghosts and theyll kill you
well gang it looks like we have to pack it up
awww
god-damnit now what the hell are we gonna do
oh hey the kids from last night
wow is that the antonio banderas life-sized blow-up doll
hey kenny
(aw man)
say whats the matter you kids look kind of glum
somebody took my dead grandma
what
we dug her up cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders but then something took her body away
now shes doomed to walk the earth in limbo
aw i hate to see little clowns cry
well that does it somethin funny is going on here your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts
theyre not pirate ghosts jonathan theyre ghost pirates
huh
"pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died and became a ghost but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate
no david then they are pirate ghosts because theyre the ghosts of pirates
youre wrong because there were no pirates in colorado so these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact
but that makes them pirate ghosts
no it makes them ghost pirates
pirate ghosts
guys guys guys fighting isnt gonna solve anything dont you see this is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do
pirate ghosts
then youll help us
sure well help you if theres one thing we like more than playing music its solvin a groovy mystery
al-right
is everybody okay
people stealing bodies to have sex with them pirate ghosts destroying the town when did everything go so wrong
i hate to say it but i think priest maxi was right this is what we get for celebrating halloween and allowing that band korn to come play
hes right nothin ever went wrong in this town before that evil korn band showed up
well i say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town
yeah
lynch mob
down with korn
so this is where you last saw your dead grandma
right
maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside
alright gang we have to split up and look for clues
how should we split up
i know lets have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life which they can overcome go this way and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way
o-kay
wow that was easy
heres their van heres their van
lets flip it over
yeah
okay people lets try to stay orderly the best way to do this is all get on one side and push it from the top
devil worshipers
yeah
come on they gotta be around here somewhere
this place gives me the creeps
say this looks like a clue "pirate lore of south park" hmmm now why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates
whoa what was that
the noise came from in here stay close everybody
oh no i lost my glasses
what does this dead grandma look like
uh she was all like crunchy and crispy and stuff
hey i got an idea we should set a groovy trap
good idea
how do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts
we need something that might catch their eye to use as bait i know your antonio banderas love doll
oh no this is my christmas present if anything happens to it my mom will know i opened it early
come on kid we all have to do our part even antonio
my glasses gotta be around here somewhere is that you jonathan boy im glad to see you i lost my glasses
raaarrrgh
hey you got a cold jonathan
raarraarrgh
yeah that sounds like a groovy song man remember that one
fieldy what are you doing
oh i was talking to you jonathan hey wait a minute if youre over there then how could you be over here unless youre actually a
puh-puuhh pirate ghost
raaarrrgh
okay heres how the trap will work when the pirate ghosts walk in they should go right for antonio banderas when they hit the super-slippery floor theyll slide onto this mining cart which should travel down this path into the next room where the fish net will fall on them
wow cool
hey somebodys coming
aaaaah
weve got to hide
hey theres antonio banderas hell help us mr banderas
jonathan no
aaaah
oh no
aaaah
ow
hold on guys
alright korn time for you to get out of town
aarrrrgh
aaaaaah
korn is sending their demon minions upon us
aaaaaah
alright gang looks like were gonna have to use our special korn powers korn powers vitalize
munky
david
fieldy
head
jonathan
form of corn
alright great job gang
that didnt help at all
we know its just cool to do
aarrrrgh
nibblet
nibblet
what the hell is that thing
you did it nibblet you trapped them
yeah and now lets see who these pirate ghosts really are oh i guess they really were pirate ghosts
alright korn you can stop your demonic shenanigans and come downtown with me
hehey look what nibblet sees
whoa
what the
father maxi
well what are you waiting for barbrady arrest that band
oh
no arrest him
huh
i think ive got this groovy mystery solved
well i must say i still dont get this at all
its simple priest maxi didnt want there to be a halloween so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks
yeah and then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts
then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese aaaaraargh
and all he had to do then was create a ghost ship by using some candles a mirror and two squirrels
father why did you go to all this trouble
because halloween is an abomination of god i would do anything to stop this wretched unholy holiday
including killing people and wreaking havoc all over south park
dont you see that by trying to stop halloween youve scared the hell out of everybody
no
okay buddy you can explain downtown
well this is all fine and good but it doesnt explain what happened to my mothers body
yeah wheres grandma
eeewww
there she is
oooh
ho-hoh
well thanks a lot korn you korn powers really came through for us
yes we were wrong about you will you please play for our halloween party
well sure why the heck not
all right
raarrrr
oh no the pirate ghosts are back
nibblet
uh oh
well this sure has been a wacky night but me and the gang learned a lot and we hope you did too you all perceived us to be mean evil people but really were just normal guys and we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when actually they were just cotton swabs so i guess the lesson is its easy to perceive somethin someway and then be wrong so we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive
yeah
the gang and i wrote a song about it and it goes goes a little somethin like thisand a-one and-a-two and a
boo
aaaah
sweet
antonio no you son of a bitch chicken from outer space thing come back here
and the winner of the costume contest is wendy for her chewbacca costume come on up wendy
