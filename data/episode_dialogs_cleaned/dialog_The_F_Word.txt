and so i said to the guy "you really think im paying that much"
heheh oh jesus christ oh my god
i thought we were past this
students i am here because of a very serious matter this morning it was discovered that in several places all over town somebody had spray-painted the words "fags get out" many witnesses reported seeing children with spray paint now if anybody knows anything about the kids who did this you must come forward-
that was us
scuse me
yeah we did that
yeah
why would you write something like that and be proud of it
w-well cause we want all of those fags to get out of our town
yeah everyone hates those fags right
yeah uh huh i do yep
now just what the heck is going on here this is not what we have taught you in this school kyle and stan youve always been tolerant of gay people
gay people
we arent talking about gay people
you just admitted to spray-painting that they should get out of town
dude why would we want gay people to get out of town
oh they think we meant gay fags
oh hey thats not very nice mayor just because a person is gay doesnt mean hes a fag
what you four boys in my office now
aw crap
faggot often shortened to fag has been used in the english language since the late sixteenth century its original meaning was "an old or unpleasant woman"
that certainly dont apply to us
faggot later was defined as a bundle of sticks and in the nineteenth century a faggot gatherer was someone who made a meager living gathering firewood
well they certainly aint calling us fags cause we gather sticks theres got to be more
whats that part say there
later the term "fag" was defined as any awkward bundle to be carried and was often used as an insult to the elderly as in calling them "baggage"
fag was used as an insult to women then poor people then old people
in the early 1900s the word became a pe-jo-ra-tive term against homosexuals and transgender people in the united states
well that word just keeps changing its meaning whats it got to do with us
we are really trying to understand this how is it that you boys think referring to gay people as fags in todays world is acceptable
because were not referring to gay people you can be gay and not be a fag
yeah a lot of fags arent gay
i happen to be gay boys do you think im a fag
do you ride a big loud harley and go up and down the streets ruining everyones nice time
no
then youre not a fag
so what if a guy is gay and rides a harley
then hes a gay fag i mean is this really this hard
i dont know
(this is fucking ridiculous)
all right look youre driving in your car okay and youre waiting to make a left at a traffic signal the light turns yellow should be your turn to go but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming and even when the light turns red a guy in a bmw runs the red light so you cant make your left turn what goes through your mind
"fag"
right but youre not thinkin "oh hes a homosexual" youre thinkin "oh hes an inconsiderate douchebag like a harley rider"
this this is making insanely good sense to me
alright how about this what would you call a straight man who doesnt own a harley but likes them and might buy one someday
you call them "bike-curious"
"bike-cu-"
"bike-curious" dont you people keep up with todays lingo at all
(jesus fucking christ)
fellow homosexuals i believe we have an opportunity here to take a big step forward for our kind we must acknowledge that the words "fag" and "faggot" are never going to disappear theyre simply too much fun for everyone to say but we must realize that we are no longer the most hated people on the planet and help the children change the meaning of the word to describe those annoying loud faggot harley riders
hear hear
we should all be tolerant but not with these fucking people they really are faggots
yes jesus yes
this is channel 4 evening news
a new movement in south park is bringing to question the word "fag" gay groups are pointing out that the word no longer means to kids today what it meant just a few years ago
and what is your name little boy
martin
alright martin can you do me a favor could you point to the "fag" for me just point to which one is the fag all right now could you just point to the fag for me little girl which one is a faggot
sparked by this realization and persuaded by a gay advocate group the mayor signed a new city ordinance today making the word "fag" officially refer to annoying inconsiderate harley riders
how do you fags feel about the new city ordinance
what did you say
just asking you if you feel okay or displeased about the ordinance fag
hey you know what if you call me fag in my face one more time youd better-
i already did it twice
well i think that- i think that you uh you probably wont say it again
i bet i do
well okay i-
fag
as more people in south park adapt to the new meaning
fags
more and more harley riders are deciding to ride elsewhere
oh yeah nice kenny
isnt this awesome you guys i havent seen a harley for like three days
i know its like we have the outdoors back again
you four turd balls in my office now
aw crap
you have got me in a lot of trouble
the fact of the matter is that "fag" is still defined in the dictionary as a pejorative term against homosexuals and so you are still causing harm to gay people everywhere whether you mean it differently or not the town of south park and its mayor have once again shown themselves to be completely out of touch with the progressive world
shes gaining support all over the country i should have never listened to you
were sorry mayor
oh thats nice you made our entire town look like gay-bashing redneck homophobes but at least youre sorry
we can fix this
how
that that lady said its because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary so we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition
hey hey yeah then people would be free to call harley riders fags all over the country
now i dont know about you but i think this town is starting a trend and if we let them officially change the meaning of "fag" from gay people to us then soon every town might if we dont do anything we can end up trying to fight e- if we dont do anything we c- hey bartlett bartlett im trying to talk you fag aw see now they got us doin it to ourselves we gotta put a stop to this now were going to ride into that town and kick some fuckin ass
excitement is in the air as the citizens of south park amass to see if the word "fag" will officially be changed in the english dictionary four local boys will state their case to the head dictionary editor and if they succeed "fag" will officially refer to harley riders nationwide
you can do it boys we believe in you
and tom it looks as though the dictionary officials have arrived entering the scene now are the keepers of the current dictionary and of course the dictionarys head editor mr emmanuel lewis
emmanuel lewis huh
ohh it all makes sense now
to change the definition of a word is no trifling thing i expect this proposal for changing the definition of the word "fag" to be both discerning and undisputable
come on boys you can do it
look out its a bunch of pissed-off faggots
theres fags everywhere
we gotta run
waaah what nefariousness is this ogh you obdurate beast
well well now do you think were fags
yes yes sir you are total fags
yeah you definitely made your point
no we rolled in kicked ass and took shit over is that what a fag does
yeah yeah thats totally what a fag does
no youre supposed to think were not fags now
but then why are you acting like such fags i dont understand
i dont either
thats because you guys never understood you fellers never got what these people are really about freedom rebellion against the system a living image of independence solid defiant and supremely cool the biker is an all-american icon of resilient individuality and freedom
who is this little fag
im not a fag yet sirruh but a but i am bike-c-curious
thats it lets kill them all
no thatll just make you bigger fags
no one is killing anyone weve had enough you faggots get the hell out of our town
all right everyone all right we are fags yeah were fags were total fags and you know what we like it
yeah we like being fags
so go ahead america whenever you pass by harley riders like us roll down your window and yell "faggots" all you kids out there when you see us walk up to us and say "hello fags" no really we want you to at least were cool enough to embrace who we are right guys
thats right you got it yeah
come on fags lets roll out
and that mister editor is why they are the true definition of fags
let there be no perplexity those individuals are the legitimate faggots the definition shall be replaced
we did it yeah
yeah we did it you guys
oh its over its finally over
today weve made history
