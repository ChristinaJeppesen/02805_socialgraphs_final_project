well here we are dude the first day of fourth grade
yeah no more getting pushed around by fourth graders
get out of my way you little dorks
hey were fourth-graders now too
yeah but now were fifth-graders you stupid fourth-graders so move it
ungh gay dude
dude we gotta find some third-graders to beat up hey come here
what
what grade are you going into
thi-ird
stupid third grader
yeah get out of here
uhuhuhow
there thats better
you know i heard our fourth-grade teacher is some new lady from denver
denver
u-hoh dude we could walk all over her
hes right we have to take a hard stance right now and establish that were the dominant ones in this relationship
alright hey listen up everybody we need to stand up to this new teacher and insert ourselves lets all do something radical
like what
like ah how about right at 835 we all jump up on our desks and pull down our pants and shout "kiss my ass" all together
yeah
why thats perfect
well buh wuh when we pull our pants down should we stand frontways or back i mean do we show er our behinds or-ar our w-wieners
i think showing her our asses should be quite sufficient butters
uh-uh maybe we could stand like this with our wieners pokin through the back of our legs you know and give er a nice fruit bowl
yeah or we could just show our asses
okay so its decided when the clock hits 835 we all stand up on our desks pull down our pants and yell "kiss my ass"
together we are strong
yeah
hey timmy might need some help pulling his pants down
we got you covered timmy
timmay
whoa dude this is our new classroom
huhuh look at all this stuff
hey what the hell is with these little half-desks
dude look at the walls everything is written in some strange foreign language
alright children quiet down welcome to the fourth grade
holy god dude
(those titties are fuckin huge)
my name is ms choksondik
more like ms makes-me-sick
yeah
play time is over children do you understand me i dont know how your last teacher behaved but this is the fourth grade and it is time to go to work
kiss my ass oh weak you guys seriously weak
well young man i hope you have a good explanation for this
oh im sure i do
this is the fourth grade you need to grow up
im trying
now get back to your desk and write a thousand-word essay on why you feel you need to disrupt my class
fantastic then
now let us begin our first-day exam silence
what a bitch
and did you see her lazy eye you cant even tell what shes looking at
you guys are all such pussies
i cant take it man writing in cursive fractions i cant do i-it
this is it the end of innocence this is the loss of that playful youth all our parents warned us about
i just didnt think it would come so soon
yeah only now do we realize how much we all took the third grade for granted
huh
everything was great in third grade and now that its all over were starting to see just how special it was remember how it used to be in the third gradewe used to laugh and play and cherish each day in the third gradewe learned wondrous things from a teacher so nicesat on marshmallow desks with teddy-bear smilesthe world seemed to all make sensebut that sense seems to slowly fadeafter third gradein the third grade we used to write with crayonswe would make sparkly pictures with glitter and gluewe had warm cookies and hearts full of loveand there wasnt a care in the world of me of youtheres not a thing in this life that i wouldnt trade just to go back for one minuteto third grade
wow i had already forgotten how great third grade was
huh-it sure was
i wish i was still there
hey thats it we gotta go back to third grade
how
we travel back in time
oh yeah time travel
oowuh how are we gonna do that does it hurt i dont wanna do it if it hurts or if it makes you get all sticky
it cant be that bad people do it on tv all the time
yeah we just have to find somebody who knows how to do it
well what about those two college guys next door to me theyre always doing science experiments in their basement
yeah if theres a way to travel back in time those two dorks will know how
when it comes to time-traveling theory there are basically two school of thought the spock theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape the lieutenant commander data theory however is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-
look whatever it takes we just have to get back to third grade
time-travel is no laughing matter four times the enterprise went back in time and four times they almost didnt make it back
we dont want to make it back we want to stay there
oh
so can you do it
its all theoretical but from a scientific standpoint the creation of a rip in space-time is possible we just need to find an inertia device
heeeyyy this kids electric wheelchair might be just what we need
tuh-timmih
oh this new fourth-grade teacher is driving me nuts
whats the problem
uh you see chef ms choksondik has very large uh honkers and she doesnt seem to like wearing a bra
you call that a problem that sounds like heaven to me
no its really not as nice as you might imagine chef mkay
principal victoria i would like a word
oooo call the doctor
my new students are the most misbehaved illiterate brain-dead group of children i have ever come across
well miss choksondik those children did fairly well in the third grade
one of them is mentally handicapped for christs sake
oh which one
the one in the wheelchair look i would like to have a talk with their last years teacher who was it mr uh-heh garrison
im afraid thats impossible nobodys seen mr garrison since the last school year ended
why where did he go
we dont like to talk about it
but i need help reaching these kids i have nothing but the highest expectations for them and with god as my witness-
aww oooo
im going to teach these kids the wonders of the world so that they can reach the top i hope that sometime very soon you will let me in on what happened to this mr garrison and with that i will bid you good day
wuh sure thing fine bye-bye then
alright when we power up the handicapped kids chair will accelerate at a high rate of speed about 10 feet that way then make the required magnetic vibrations
if the fields are right it should then create a wormhole up near the front of the classroom
you guys dont actually think this is going to work do you
now eh when you all see a wormhole yuh-you guys are gonna have about 42 seconds to run through it
and on the other side you will find yourself in exactly the same spot only one year ago
back in the third grade
cool/wow
i cant wait until the teacher yells at us this time and we all tell her to suck our balls
yeah
oh here she comes
alright children i hope you all did your homework last night please pass your papers up to the frontuh
suck my balls oh god-damnit you guys i am so seriously-
i said pass your papers to the fronteh
we didnt do our homework ms makes-me-sick we didnt feel like it
its choksondik and you are all going to have detention
hahaa charade you are teacher im afraid we have different plans gentlemen
primary fusion initiated
molecular grenadine active
aa-aa-ah
what are you doing
were going back in time to third grade goodbye teacher perhaps we shall see you in another year hahaaa
timmaaaaaaaaah timmaaaaaaaaah
i didnt think it would work
me neither
well well well id say somebody has some explaining to do
youre damn right they do
dude timmys chair is packed with all that stuff weve gotta help him
yeah
come on
children children come back here
timmy you have to stop
no
no
look the system malfunctions if he stops the nuclear core can bake his magnetic field and the whole chair will blow sky-high
what timmy youve got to get off that chair
no
no
weve rigged the chair to be sensitive to his weight if he gets off the whole thing blows
so if timmy drops his speed below five miles an hour the chair blow and if he gets off the chair blows
yup
my god
its been over three hours since the police first showed up on the scene of a handicapped boys wheelchair set with explosives
over here over here
the child cant stop or get off the chair without risking explosion and so the swat team will now attempt to disarm the device
timmi-hih-ih
closer dont worry son just watch your speed and stay still
look out hansen
oh
aaaah
timmaaay
dear jesus hang on lady
oh my god whats going on
maam be very careful that wheelchair is set to explode
what aaah omigod omigod
its okay just stay calm and keep the speed above 5
o-kay o-kay omigod
tih-timmah
okay i kept the speed at 5
good whats the wheelchairs battery power at
oh my god less than 20 minutes
less than 20 minutes
oh no what have we done
whattaya think too forward
i have had it
waaah
these children are out of control i must speak with their last years teacher mr garrison
as we said before thats impossible
what in gods name happened to him
uuuh ms choksondik mr garrison had several uuh eee-motional issues he was a closet homosexual who hated gay people whenever someone asked him if he was gay hed go nuts
and then he was accused of trying to solicit sex from a young boy
after being dismissed from teaching he went off to write romance novels his first novel sold well and everything was fine until he found out that his novel won the gay pulitzer prize and was considered the best homoerotic novel since huckleberry finn
he finally snapped and had a nervous breakdown and went up into the mountains to live in solitude
some say that on cold nights you can still hear him moanin "im not gaaay im not gaaay"
iiimmm nnnooottt gggaaayyy
and nobody has found him
well we really havent ll-looked
i see then the only way ill find the secret to teaching these kids is to go up into those mountains and find mr garrison myself
but he could be anywhere up high in those mountains
oh ill find him even if i have to climb up and up and up
nooo
what
oh my god oh my god
tom im standing about two miles outside of denver where the darling handicapped boy fights for his life on a wheelchair of death guys can you tell us what kind of explosive were actually dealing with here
uh well its a simple hydrogen-fusion core with a veltig reactant-
ah please help
which just turned into a time bomb
please help
this has never happened in all the 72 original star trek episodes
yah wait you mean 73 episodes
no there were 72
no there werent
oh you are such a nerd
tom i understand that now the rescuers are gonna try and send in one of the handicapped boys little friends in an attempt to keep him calm and hopefully disarm the device
its alright everythings goin tuh be fine
oh my god
alright young man when you get underneath that wheelchair i want you to relay back to me with this walkie-talkie and then ill tell you which wires to cross ready
(yes sir)
go below
(hi guys) (uh oh) (uff im okay) (im okaaayyyyyyy)
well who didnt see that coming
oh my god oh my god
stay calm you have to stay calm
but if we got off the chair it blows up
no no thats only if the boy gets off

dude you gotta build us another time machine
huh oh cant
what do you mean "cant" you made it work just build us another one
i cant because pizza-face isnt here were not on speaking terms we got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out
w-what did you get in a fight about
theres 73 original star treks he keeps saying theres 72
oh jesus christ youve got to be kidding me
no he actually thinks theres 72
look dude cant you just build us another machine without him
no pizza-face took all his equipment home to his moms now if you can go over there and get him to admit that hes wrong
alright come on guys man i cant believe we have to do this while timmys already back in time
yeah timmys probably back in third grade right now living it up
timmah timmaaaaahhh
alright lets try it again
"children we are now going to do math problems"
"but teacher i dont want to do my math problems"
"uuh ah you will do them or else youll be in very big trouble"
"well im not gong to do it teacher you can just suck my balls"
"dont use that kind of language young man"
nooo
no
look you cant counter a profane command with an idle threat you must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion when a child says "suck my balls" you say "present them"
oh
now lets try it again suck my balls
pre-sent them
good very good youre ready to move on to the next level but i warn you we will now be diving deep into your own psyche these children know what scares you and so we too must face those demons
im ready im not afraid
you will be you will be you will be
god-damnit this is ridiculous
what
dude can you please just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade
look there arent 73 episodes of star trek there are 72 "the menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode pizza-face is wrong
who the hell cares
i know why does he have to be such a dick about it
wouldnt it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing
no because hes wrong
look you guys built a machine together that can bend time if youll just agree with him you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science
and live in a world of 72 original star treks i dont think so i dont want to live in that world
god these guys are such geek dumbasses
i know
yeh-hah they dont even realize that "the menagerie" originally was the pilot and later got split up into two episodes eh ha ha ha ha hahahaha eh the eh the dumbasses
wait a minute ive got it
what
dude if you guys build another time machine you can travel back in time and ask the creator of star trek how many episodes there were
dude jesus youre right
this is it the tree of insight you must go in and face what lives inside
what lives inside
hell if i know i wouldnt go in there
oh alrighty what the why theres nothing in here but an exit to the other side theres nothing in here at all oh and i actually thought my mental demons would be in here wait a minute maybe theres not supposed to be anything in here maybe im supposed to see that i alone do have the strength to reach the kids i think i get it now
hey hurry up in there jesus youre taking too long in the damn tree of insight you in there hey where the hell did she go what the haaa who who are you
i am you i am your gay side
my gay side uh- i dont have a gay side
you must face me at last
you arent real you cant be
it is me your darkest fear your gay self incarnate
what do you want
i want you to not fight me anymore to accept me once and for all
why
dont you see all these years your pain your confusion it comes from one place your denial of who you are of who we are
but im not gay everyone just thinks i am
oh stop it what about the time you looked at counselor mackeys penis in the mens locker room
i was just comparing size
for seven minutes
aaa
and what about the time you masturbated to the mens 100-meter swimming relay at the olympics
i was beating off to the chicks
