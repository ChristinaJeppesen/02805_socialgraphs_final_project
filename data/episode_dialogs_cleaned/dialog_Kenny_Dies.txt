oh well i suppose if it can help others
the hope is that someday it might

cartman
oh kyle hey whats goin down jew-boy
cartman were you crying
no no i mean i i got somethin in my eyes its this uh the air in here is just- uh oh man
hey cartman i care a lot about him too
im gonna find a cure kyle i swear to god im gonna find a cure
sure you will cartman sure you will
this is where the bulk of our research was being done but due to the government ban were mostly just packing things up
doctor can you tell me exactly how stem cells work
look you have trillions of cells in your body heart cells skin cells brain cells and so on but before a cell is designated as a toenail cell or a pancreas cell its what we call a stem cell sort of like a blank cell do you understand
not at all but go on
because these cells are blanks they will often program themselves based on what cells you put around them you see this rat earlier this year we surgically removed the middle of her spine then we injected her with some stem cells and they became the missing part of the spine
my god
nerve cells damaged by parkinsons disease or heart tissue of cardiac patients might ultimately be replaced by tissue grown from stem cells
so then could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away in other words if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease the stem cells could become new muscle tissue
thats the theory
well so then if the stem cells are placed nest to s shakeys pizza they would become another shakeys pizza and youd have your own shakeys pizza where you didnt have to charge yourself to eat
well no to build another shakes it would be better to use lumber
hmmm
but unfortunately the government has banned stem cell research and so well never know
looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the governments mind
where are you going
theres a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now doctor im gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves
hey kid give em hell give em hell
oh doctor thanks thanks
oh hey kid good luck good luck
oh and doctor ah never mind
and see heres one from butters it says "we cant wait to see you back in school kenny" and it has a picture of him and you in a little airplane
oh isnt that nice youve got lots of friends dont you kenny
(yes) (but what about stan)
stan oh well no theres nothing here from stan but well stans gonna come and see you real soon i bet kenny
(i hope so)
hey look whos here
(stan)
hello kenny im laura jones and this is bob ferrin
were with the make-a-wish foundation
oh kenny isnt that nice
(the make-a-wish foundation)
we travel the country given special little boys and girls like you their biggest wish
neat huh kenny
(yes)
so kenny if you could have one wish what would it be
whats your wish pal
(i guess the only thing i wish is to not die)
what did he say
he said his wish is not to die
o-kay and what if youre gonna have two wishes what would the second one be
i know i bet you wanna meet madonna huh
(no fuckin madonna)
wu- what was that
he said madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago and that now she suddenly speaks with a british accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself
should i come in now
uh no not quite yet
hello there children
hey chef
hows it goin
bad
yeah things have been better
why would god let kenny die chef why kennys my fr-f-f-friend why cant god take someone elses f-f-friend
stan sometimes god takes those closest to us because it makes him feel better about himself he is a very vengeful god stan hes all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago he just cant get over it so he doesnt care who he takes children puppies it dont matter to him so long as it makes us sad do you understand
but then why does god give us anything to start with
well look at it this way if you want to make a baby cry first you give it a lollipop then you take it away if you never give it a lollipop to begin with then it would have nothin to cry about thats like god who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears you see its our tears stan that give god his great power
i think i understand
my name is eric cartman and i live in colorado my best friend in the whole world is kenny mccormick and he hes sick right now hes real sick hes only eight years old and his doctors dont think he has very long to live look i realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject but all i know is that if theres a chance a chance that stem-cell research could save my best friends life well i guess i owe it to him to try and change your minds i love kenny mccormick and i want you to love him too and i uh im not the best speaker in the world maybe i can put it best in the words of a timeless song it was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meantthe heat of the moment shone in your eyesi never meant to be so bad to youone thing i said that i would never do
one look from you and i would fall from grace
and that would wipe the smile right from my face
do you remember when we used to dance
and incidents arose from circumstance
one thing led to another we were young and we would scream together songs unsungit was the heat of the momenttelling me what our hearts meantthe heat of the momentshone in your eyes
and so you see now that the ban on stem-cell research has been lifted we can sell your fetus to companies like alder labs
oh i dont know
look i can offer you seventy-five dollars for that fetus right now jill
seventy-five dollars well alright
great just sign right here please hi havin an abortion today great listen if youd like to sell your abortion for research im offering uh seventy-five dollars help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there and you sign right here uh excuse me maam can i interest you in selling your aborted fetus
were not going to the abortion clinic im going to have this baby
oh im sorry to hear that because uh theres a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could the stem cells from your fetus could help save his life
oh well i guess we can always just make another one
oh mark i love you
alright now kenny has a fighting chance
young man do you know where youre going
yeah im gonna see my friend because he needs me right now
all right
go kid
good for you
hey kenny oh no no
he just he just stopped breathing and it was over
but i didnt get to see him hell i i didnt get to sssay good-bye did he say anything before he went
he just said "wheres stan"
and so we will all miss kenny his playful laughter his innocent smile but we will never forget that it was because of brave kenny that stem-cell research was allowed to continue
i let kenny down im his worst f-f-f-friend
you guys come quick
what cartman
its why its a miracle you guys
what cartman whats happened
look i put the stem cells from all the fetuses i had next to a shakeys and they are replicating a new shakeys it worked
this whole time you were just using kennys illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses
stupid fetuses its my own shakeys
i actually hugged you i held you in my arms and and cried with you
i think i only need a hundred or so more aborted babies and i can finish up the kitchen
aaargh
aah kyle kyle
hey i wasnt kennys worst f-f-f-friend cartman was
