kindergarten teacher herbert garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money mr garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device which he simply calls "it" so what exactly is "it" here with a report is a hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel
thanks tom i-oh thanks tom so far herbert garrison hasnt let anyone get a look at his invention he claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause ones eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it but earlier today hbc news got footage of some of the countrys top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look including steve forbes steve jobs ted turner donald trump bill gates and yasmine bleeth their curiosity is piqued tom and so is ours what is "it" what does "it"do and when will it be somewhere where i can buy one reporting live jeff arrando hbc news
you need to learn to play some sports kyle so were gonna start with a tough one called "catch the ball" i throw the football to you you throw it back to me

you did too you are so full of crap
no im seriously because um i was i was talkin to craig and craig was all like "hey did you know that in world war ii they really had concentration camps" and i was all like "no way" and this little light went on in my head like "aw man no wonder kyle thought what i said in the class seemed like it was directed at his cousin" but but i was literally talkin about a concentration camp you know where you go for a week to learn and focus you know oh mahan what a misunderstanding huh
you blew the deal cartman

gentlemen imagine being able to travel safely at incredibly fast speeds and not having to go to the stupid fartface airports
that sounds incredible mr garrison
it is incredible mr hat and what makes it possible is its patented gyroscope design gentlemen i give you it
whoa

it gets over 300 miles to the gallon and is safely capable of speeds of over 200 miles per hour
whoa wow
this will change everything
were going to have to rethink cities
now it is easily operated using four flexigrip handles two of them are on each side left side for throttle right side for steering the third flexigrip is gently inserted into the anus to keep the driver in place
ugh oh
there we go now the final flexigrip is directly in front of the driver so that its small switches can be operated with the mouth as such put the four together and were ready to go
oh my god
look at it go
but the way it works do you think people will go through that to travel
hey it still beats what you go through at the airports
true
yup
yeah thats true
yeap
i cant take it anymore stan my cousins been here for two weeks and hes driving me insane
i know dude every kid in school wants to kick his ass
i spent five years in this town making a good name for jews and this this stereotype shows up and wrecks it all you know what my biggest fear is that ill become him that somehow his mannerisms will start rubbing off on me and ill become a stereotype i mean im a jew and hes making me hate jews
dude a self-hating jew you are becoming a stereotype
ya see
im ba-ack
ugh
book later dude
tom the day is finally here it has arrived for retail sale and people are getting their first look at it
okay good just step through here and then this is your steering and heres your throttle
okay
okay now youre just gonna feel a little pinch
haaaow
its alright its just locking you in you can take it doing great kathy hows that ride okay now use your mouth to operate the turn signals and youre off great who else wants to give it a spin

here you go robby
hello im john travolta i used to rely on airlines to get me to set but once i got used to it i found it to be a little less painful than dealing with the airline companies i just power up the flexigrips and im ready to go thank you it
so join the millions of americans who have felt a little more comfortable with traveling order yours today and remember our slogan its better than flying
hm that was pretty gay
kyle two where is kyle
i dont know mom last time i saw him he was sledding
where on earth could he be
you know its just possible he went back to connecticut

what do you think mr marsh all set to put a down payment on that baby

well it seems all the buttons on these front and rear flexigrips are also found on the side of the vehicle
yeup
well so they dont really do anything
right
so then couldnt i just order one that works without going in and out of my ass and mouth
well i guess you could
huh
whazzat
wha- what did you- what did he say

i dont know about this guys i think playing hide and seek in the airport might be dangerous
kyle we told you kids in colorado all play hide and seek at the airport
yeah as soon as we get to the concourse youll see how fun it is
ungh this is taking too long the flight to connecticut is about to leave ey can we speed things up here
daaah sorry but ever since that it thing came out the airlines have had to cut back on employees
dude were the only ones here how long does it take five people through security
derr lets see twelve people plus times divided two hours domestic three hours international
cant we just play hide and seek at home
no
dah ha whats this a toenail clipper die terrorist

shutting me down why
the airlines are in desperate trouble your vehicle is causing them to lose money
yeah well that was the point dingleberry ah-t put that down
right so the government is bailing the airlines out again by shutting you down and making its illegal
oh god-damnit youd better be kidding
sir many people work for the airlines we cant let them all be fired
the airline companies are losing money because of their own incompetence and their own inefficiency
