who was it somebodys about to get their asses kicked when i find out who did this
pc principal is on the warpath run for your lives
again
oh jesus now what
who was it huh somebody better fess up right now im gonna find out who did this broflovski was it you
was what me sir
i just saw a copy of the school newspaper in which a student used the word "retarded" to refer to our cafeteria lunch policy the word "retarded" does not belong in our school who is in charge of the school paper cause im about to break their fuckin legs
aaah hes in charge of the school paper you gonna break his legs pc principal
alright uhh i i guess we havent formally met before uhh the reason i need to talk with you jason is because of a very important-
its jimmy actually my name is jimmy pc principal
alright jim thank you i want to talk to you today about the use of the r word in your school paper you see the r word is very bad
says who
says me right now i know a thing or two about the rights of people with disabilities when you use the r word to describe the schools lunch policy it can hurt peoples hearts can you understand that at all
that was an op-ed piece in the paper written by a first grader who found the school lunch policy to be ridiculous and he thought "r-retarded" to be the best word to describe it as the editor of the paper i didnt think it was right to censor the words the student used
okay well from now on im gonna need to approve the school paper before you hand it out okay
no
whatd you say
youre new here so you dont understand how seriously i take my job as editor of the school paper i dont allow ads and i dont allow anything that might t-t-t-taint the truth behind what people are thinking i dont want people to be afraid of words if it stops them from having a dialog
look i dont wanna get angry okay
why are you uncomfortable around people with disabilities thats okay lots of people are
no im not i am very not uncomfortable alright look unless i can approve your paper it is not being distributed on campus you got that
i cant hand out the school paper in school
not unless it is approved by me do you understand
yep got it
dont forget to read the school paper now delivered directly to your door super school news
what is that bro

s-s-s-suck my dick pc principal
who does this kid think he is challenging me i said one micro-aggression to him okay one little micro-aggression but that doesnt mean i have an unconscious bias towards people with disabilities
no way bro thats wack
but why would a person with a disability not see that what im trying to do is actually protect them
sometimes victims of oppression are so marginalized that they begin to sympathize with their oppressors
yeah bro
youre right this kid just needs to be shown hes being an uncle abel i can always count on my pc frat brothers to have my back lets go pc
pc woo
wow wow this is so great have you ever read the elementary school newspaper linda theres no ads no sponsored content no links to click on just news stories about whats happening did you know that the police in shitpatown beat up homeless to clear them out do you know long its been since i was able to just sit back and read the news i got so used to getting news off the internet but i feel like im always trying to chase the news somehow its like im in a black void trying to reach the news story but then the next thing i know im reading an ad for geico so i click out of that and try to read the news story but its not a news story its a slide show and im looking at the worst celebrity plastic surgery jobs ever so of course i want to see the next line of plastic surgery gone wrong so i hit the arrow but then the arrow wasnt the arrow for the next line it was to take me to an ad for face cream haugh i wanted to get a news story but im reading about face cream and i try to click out of it but the ad is following me and its following me all over the screen nooo so i click on the close button but it wasnt a close button it was another slide show and i just want to know whats happening in the middle east but instead im looking at the top ten scariest movies of all time and thats not the arrow for the next line its another ad aaagh but this this is just news and i dont get lost in all the bullshit linda linda
alright jim i know youve been trying to wrap your head around some of the social issues he discussed yesterday im sure youre feeling confused and a little unsure of yourself
im not confused at all actually pc principal
okay well no you are confused-
im pretty sure that youre the one but go ahead
because you dont grasp the severity of this and thats why i brought in another young person with disabilities to share his feelings thanks for comin in to talk to us nathan
i like apples and bananas
me too bro me too nathan could you tell jimmy how you feel when people uwe the word "retarded"
it hurts my feelings because i feel bad
are you serious right now
you feel bad right you feel like thats a no-no word right
that word makes my heart piss its pants
okay wow thats pretty heavy pretty heavy huh jim
do you want to ask him what he means by that or are you just pandering because youre uncomfortable around disabled people
i am not uncomfortable i simply care about a horrible outdated word that is exclusive ignores individuality and equates intellectual disa-bility with being and its and its s-spot i need a spotter spot me somebody spot me bro
and its its part of a derogatory hate speech which fosters isolation and loneliness and being part of a voice to stop the r word is not only right but extremely important
im afraid of bears
hey nathan hold up what were you doing in there
what do you mean jimmy are you ma-ad
come on nathan you and i both know you use the word "retarded" 400 times a day
oh jimmy so righteous arent you so blind to everything thats going on
what are you talking about
do you really think all the changes happening to this town are just coincidence this goes so much deeper than you can possibly imagine jim everyones about to learn the truth and then theres a war coming a war jim and im just gonna make sure im on the right side of it
come on boys lets get back to class
i like to smell trees
an elementary school newspaper is making big waves as more and more people say no to news on the internet
i read super school news cause it dont try and fool me and its news reports arent paid for by ad companies
we just feel like this is actual news and instead of clicking on links were reading stories
i had to get away from the ads i felt like the ads were evolving somehow they started knowing what i liked what i was afraid of i tried ad blockers but it seemed like every time i tried to block the ads they just got smarter im never going back from super school news
the young editor of the paper claims that since most people now watch news reports on the internet theyre easily distracted or even fooled by ads which are finding more and more clever ways to disguise them-
oooo brutal celebrity mugshots o-hoh it got me ad got me sharon
we now return live to the 2015 presidential debate
our next question is for you mrs clinton many voters believe that syrian refugees should not be allowed into our country for security reasons what do you think
keeping our country save has become more and more difficult but i believe there are several things that we can-
no you shut the hell up youve got a dumpy butt and seven chins syrian refugees are all terrorists
i know that our government needs to take a harder look at all-
yeah well its pretty hard to look at you we can all agree on that
she looks like a donkey took a shit in her face
yeh-hah good one caitlyn see what i know is that theres only one way to deal with syrian refugees and that is
fuck them all to death
thank you that was hilarious when you called her a pizza face
its like a papa johns pimple party
oh that was classic caitlyn youre the best running mate ever
hello mr garrison
oh my god principal victoria
congratulations on the polls we need to talk
celebrate diversity woooo
go pc
alright everyone listen up tonight is a very special night for the pcs were honored to be throwing this event for people with disabilities i for one am sick of how these amazing kids are marginalized in todays society but tonight is about learning and healing so lets get to it pc
hey guys im brad im pc arizona state
nice to meet you brad where do you guys-
excuse me a second hello ladies thanks for coming to our event
hi
were just tired with the way people with disabilities get treated can i get you some alcohol
yah you know it just bugs me when people refer to persons with disabilities as "handicapped" when i hear that word i wanna fuckin punch them in the fuckin face
thats so cool of you wow
yeah to me marginalizing persons with disabilities by asking them what their handicap is is a micro-aggression no better than asking a person of color if they went to college
wow youre really progressive
no other way to be so uh listen i think youre really pretty and interesting and id kinda like to take you upstairs and totally crush your pussy would that be acceptable to you
oh well i i guess it would
no im sorry i need affirmative consent ill need you to say "yes you may take me upstairs and crush my pussy at this time"
pc bros pc yeah
mckinsey you got consent forms
oh yeah right here bro
rise and shine guys if you scored last night ill need your consent forms thank you thank you thank you-whoa barker did you perform cunnilingus theres a different release form bro
yup uh so- sorry its right here
nice
bro aw dude bro
what bro
dude i scored with this female and after consenting to putting her mouth on my penis she wanted me to walk her home
yeah
and when i got to her house she had me meet her father who is filipino so i asked him if he could tell me about their cultural and social dynamic to being a filipino-american
naturally
so he said some stuff and then the newspaper landed on his doorstep cause i guess her dad subscribes to the school newspaper and he picked it up and i saw the headline said this
what the fuck is this bro
bro that little kid wrote that our tolerant views and fight for social justice is just a way for us to crush puss
thats not true
i know bro were being totally victimized
that little fucker dude
hello youre the boy responsible for the south park super school news
thats right
we would like to give you $26 million contracts and the first check wed love to be in business with you
what is this for
i represent an organization called geico its an insurance company we think super school news would be a great way for us to reach new customers
sorry charlie but i dont allow ads in my newspaper
weve heard all about that so we thought you could just do some news stories about car insurance just state the facts because the truth is everyone can save by switching to geico
thats called "sponsored content" i know the difference between the news and ads do you think im stupid
everyones doing it jim youre sort of the last holdout $26 million just to write some news stories that get people thinking about their insurance coverage
sth-sth-sth stick it up your ass
hm well they said youd be tough do you really think you can stop ads
yes
you can try to block ads but they get smarter the more we ty to shut them out the more clever they get theres a war coming kid and im gonna make sure im on the right side of it
officer barbrady
come with me if you want to live come on come with me if you want to live im serious
do you want to explain to me what pussy crushing is
what
your little meetings you go to at night to discuss social justice its just a way to pick up on young women
sh-sharon most of the guys in my pc club are right out of college alright you know how college kids are who wrote this
i dont want you going over there anymore
i dont cheat on you sharon im happy look at whats happened to our town we have shitpatown boutique restaurants and artisan shops we have a fucking whole foods and that was all me diverse people are moving here and everyone is being aware of how they talk this is paradise sharon
is it all i know is that youve changed every since you joined this pc thing you just bully people and wait for people to say anything improper so you can jump down their throats for whatever words he or she used
he or she is an agenderphobic microagressions sharon you are a bigot
the average human can no longer tell the difference between the news and an ad you seem to have some mental ability that allows you to know the difference
does this have to do with me calling the school principal a pussy crusher
the pc people are simply being manipulated unwittingly setting the table for the new enemy of humanity
you mean isis or ninjas
something much worse have you ever felt like an ad had intelligence that it somehow knew what you wanted even before you knew you wanted it what if i were to tell you that ads have become smarter than us and now theyre manipulating everything we do
id say that sounds pretty retarded
it was our own fault mankind became tired of ads so we kept inventing ways to make things ad-free we even created ad blockers thats when the ads had to adapt they had to disguise themselves as news in order to survive
sponsored content
if you really can tell the difference then you could be the key to saving our species jimmy wed like to run a test on you
sponsored content test 17-b ready begin
thats the news thats an ad thats the news thats an ad thats the news thats an ad thats an ad thats the new-oh no thats an ad for act food my bad
jesus christ hes off the charts
increase the intensity
thats the news thats an ad news ad ad ad ad ad news news ad ad slideshow ad

we have another child here whos special too do you know leslie
alright thats good everyone get inside everything past here is safe space no reporters no harassment we are gonna figure this shit out all i know is that i dont speak up for minorities so that i can crush pussy

yeah bro theyre taking our incredibly tolerant views and distorting them
pc people are under attack thats what this is
hey yeah bro were the victims now like were being marginalized like that makes us pretty cool
yeah i bet now we can get a lot more puss
no topher its not about puss alright the fuck is wrong with you were being labeled as meatheads who just wanna crush puss by an intolerant newspaper
yeah fuck that dude bro
yeah and like if youre gonna belittle and make fun of pc people like that then whos to say he wont do it to other marginalized groups like us i mean this kid could be the next hitler and if you guys could stop hitler what would you do
