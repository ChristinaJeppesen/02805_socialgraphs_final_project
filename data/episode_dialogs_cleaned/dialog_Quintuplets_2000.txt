mmm
tom it looks like these cute little girls have made it out of that armpit of a country they call romania
yes luckily for them these quintuplets no longer have to live in romania the asshole of the world back to you tom
this is not good it makes our country look poor and stupid
this could kill our tourism
you know what to do
alright kenny lets start with some warm-up exercises
(ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
well what do you think can you help him become a better singer
well hes got potential depends on how good he wants to be
(i wanna be really good)
well if you wanna be a real singer you need to go to a conservatory in europe theres no other alternative
(europe)
we cant afford that
well then im afraid your son will always be a hack
(awww)
well kenny if it means that much to you maybe we can bus it to europe and… you can sing on the way to make money
