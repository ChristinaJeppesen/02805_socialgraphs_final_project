because you never know the right answer butt-for-brains yes mark
the answer is 1492 however the americas had already been discovered by many before him including the vikings and the native americans and therefore your question is a charade

rebecca dont you ever look at the town at that flicker of light over there
i have looked at it
well thats a public school and in it there are children just like us
how can children go to school on a f-licker of light
from public school your house is just a flicker of light dont you want to go out all you do is stay in your house and study
well what else would one do
love for one thing
and woowhat is love
love is the most important thing on earth when boys and girls feel love they kiss
woowhat means "ki-iss"
when a man and a woman feel love they put their lips together
oh you mean a-a mate when it is time to increase the herd my provider will select one for me
rebecca in public school we select our own mate in public school men and women get together make each other happy
you certainly come from a silly place still i should like to try that kiss so i cold write about it how do we do it
im not completely sure
should we l-look it up
no i think its something you have to try a few times until you get it right
wow wow that was fun
dah does that mean youll go to the dance
y-you bet your sweet a-ass i will
alright heres the plan tomorrow night at the dance when none of the chaperones are looking you guys go grab mark bring him out here and then were gonna duct-tape him to this flagpole

the flagpole thats great

theyve got to be here somewhere
hey theres cotswolds come on lets duct-tape him to the flagpole
yeah
where are my children im taking them out of this god-forsaken place
calm down papá everything is all right you see ive learned something today public schools may be a bit lacking in education but its the main place where children learn all of their social skills you cant teach a child social skills they have to learn them themselves and the only place to do that is on the playground in the cafeteria and so on dont you see papá thats what happened to your daughter you tried so hard to keep her from anything sexual and now look at her shes a god-damned whore papá
well she sure is
i know letting your kids out into the world is scary i know you wish nothing bad would ever happen to us but bad things will happen and we have to start learning now how to deal with those things
mark youre absolutely right okay children if its what you want you can start going to public school
alright
nice speech nerdo
thanks gaywad
now youre gettin it
well come on guys if im not mistaken we still have someone to duct-tape to the flagpole
