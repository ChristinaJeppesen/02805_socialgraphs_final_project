ohhh hamburgers
thanks so much for coming to visit butters in the hospital boys it means a lot to him
what happened to him doctor
from the test results it would appear your child was tortured by a bully he received a massive snuggie his underwear pulled up so high it nearly killed him he also received two indian sunburns on his forearms a charlie horse on the thigh and a second-degree titty twister and from the damage to his head area it appears he was also given a swirly a colossal one it also looks like he received a noogie and a polish bike ride
whats that
we arent sure we only know that there is no cure
if only we had let him in why didnt we let him inside the house when he was screaming for help
now honey we were trying to read
weve got to tell them who did this you guys were gonna get it as bad as butters
thats nothing compared to what my mom will do to me if she finds out ive been lying for five years
maybe you didnt hear so good in there kyle second-degree titty-twister
calm down guys we dont have to go tell our parents we just need to go out and get some protection
