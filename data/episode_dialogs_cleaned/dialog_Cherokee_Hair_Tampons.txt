good morning children mr garrison is away today i am your substitute teacher mr wyland
oh sweet dude substitute teacher
now i understand that some students in this class like to mess with substitute teachers but if we all behave and respect each other im sure we can make this a fun and productive day lets start with roll call lets see mmmmm eric cartman
here
alright and how about stan marsh
(here)
its not that funny you guys jesus
okay and where iiiiss… kenny mccormick
here oh hoho ow
dude what the hell was that
oh huh oh geez you know when youre laughin so hard that the milk comes out your nose uh ho ho man
dude you werent drinking any milk
huh
you have to be drinking milk for that to happen
not with me man
alright look why dont we skip roll call heres what were gonna do today ive been told that one of your classmates has been ill for several days — kyle broflovski
hes fakin
well ive been told that in mr garrisons absence our activity for the day is to make a get-well card for kyle so i got this large piece of poster board and were all gonna come up and use glitterand glue to decorate it
awww
hes fakin
kenny you come and decorate the get-well card too
but i dont want kyle to get well i hate kyle
i dont care get down here and do it
hey watch it hey what are you doin
now thats a get-well card
mr garrison after very careful review the school board believes that you should take a hiatus from teaching indefinitely
what
frankly your conduct has been somewhat disconcerting
did you know that not one of your students knew who sam adams was
well who cares about a guy that makes beer jesus christ im trying to teach history
frankly mr garrison it isnt even your educational record that were most concerned about its your somewhat substantial police record
oh whatever
mr garrison last weeks charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-
that was not me that was mr hat
all were saying is perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little "child molestation" thing dies down a bit
gentlemen teaching is all i know it is the air that i breathe
were sorry mr garrison we have no choice
very well i guess im not a teacher anymore i suppose youll be wanting my badge and gun
mr garrison most teachers do not carry a gun
oh sorry so i can keep it then
kyle stan and his mother came over to visit you
hello sweetie
dude you can stop faking now we got a substitute teacher kyle
they say its his kidneys kyle always has been a diabetic and lately his kidneys have just been shutting down
well the kids at school made you a card kyle look
go on butters
ho i dont wanna
butters go on
oh uhuh alright then were so sorry youre not feeling wellwe hope youre better soonso were bringing you some sunshineby um singing you this tuneeverybody misses youand though we hate to cause a fusswed like to say "get well soon"and "please dont die on us"
dude you really are sick huh
i dont know i
i dont know what to do sharon they wanna have him go into surgery but theyre so dangerous
sheila have you tried holistic natural medicines they work wonders i read all about in people
really in people
theres a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods its run by this fascinating woman named "miss information"
oh well with a name like "miss information" she must know something
why dont we at least take kyle down there and see what she has to say
okay ill get our coats
can i go now
i dont know what im goin tuh do mackey teaching is all i know
okay well maybe you need to view this as a chance to do something youve always wanted to do
ive always wanted to write a novel
well there you go mkay
but i never know what to write about
well thats easy write about what you know write about what you love what do you love most
besides teaching
yes
poontang
m mkay
i cant help it im a womanizer sometimes i know but i just think that taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world
well that settles it mr garrison what you need to do is go write a great romance novel
yes thats it i am going to write the great american romance novel
you see the reason our body is stale is because of toxins
toxins
all the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper
wow thats amazing miss information
you hear that kyle you dont need surgery after all
uh excuse me but what do these toxins look like
what
wuh have you ever actually seen a toxin
dont be a smartass stanley
mrs broflovski i would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney i have these excellent herbs from local native americans
ooo native americans now they know how to heal the body spiritually
mr garrison
oh my he looks terrible
yes poor little dear
good morning everyone
oh thanks for coming miss information kyle seems to be getting worse
huuuuuuuuuh oh i dont agree he seems much better
really
what
yes his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday and his aura is lighter
oh thats great news
oh no
nono thats good those are the toxins flushing out of the system
ooooo
those arent toxins thats the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago
stanley what did i say about being a smartass
dont be a smartass
now dont be fooled as kyles body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse but actually he is getting better
wow well i am on natural medicines if only i had known sooner
i agree yeah thats right
mr marsh is here to see you
alright send him in oh stanley
hi doctor
how can i help you
well its my friend kyle i think hes really really sick
he is really really sick stanley i was seeing him last week when he first got ill but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine
but i dont think its working
alright stanley im going to be very honest with you your little friend kyle needs a kidney transplant or it is very possible that he will die
die but kyles my best friend in the whole world
i know this is a lot to lay on someone your age but the rest of the town is so gung-ho in new age medicine that i have nowhere else to turn
ill give kyle my kidney even if it hurts a whole lot i dont care
thats very brave stan but ive already checked my records and you and kyle arent a match for kidneys in fact theres only one person in south park with the same blood type as kyle
who oh shit
(rrrrooowwwrrr rroowwrr pew pew pow)
"coming in for attack captain" pipew pipipew give me the space cruiser kenny
(no no)
come on kenny you have to give me the subspace cruiser so i can destroy the gengrins on crespus 5
(unngh stop no no its mine) (there its mine)
no mine myah ha haa ha i broke your space cruiser kenny ha haa ha ha ha bluh oh ha-ow
ooh sweetums did you laugh too hard again
yeah
well some more of your little friends are here to play with you
okay mom
and dont get too close to kyle he looks like he might have the aids
whats goin on guys
cartman we have to ask you a question a very serious question
oh-kay
kyles in trouble cartman i can see him getting worse right before my eyes there might be a way that you can save his life
uh huh
what kyle really needs is a new kidney
oh i think i see where this is going
his mom is trying all this eastern medicine and new age bullcrap on him but its obviously not working
stan why dont you just ask the question
alright will you donate one of your kidneys to kyle
no no no no nono no no no no
but you only need one fat boy
no no no no nono nononono no no
dude one of your friends is goin tuh die dont you see how serious this is
(its not thats fucking serious)
well perhaps i could see my way to giving up a kidney for a price
oh my god
how much
i dont know how much is your life worth to you kyle
cartman you are so going to hell when you die
yes well until then i need about ten million dollars
(ten million dollars)
what the hell would you do with ten million dollars fatass
what i intend to do with the money is not an issue is it i suggest you start looking for that money quickly kyle doesnt seem to have much time tick-tock tick-tock
come on kyle lets get out of here
okay where were we kenny oh yeah "quick captain we must destroy the gengrin across the fire" give me the space cruiser give it kenny myah
oooh free-range aspirin
all-natural cell phones
oh look everyone these are our two resident native americans chief running pinto and carlos ramirez
ooo
id like to buy some more stuff
come in come here guys
do you have any new holistic items for sale
oohh oh yeah aah here uh this is a- uhh dreamcatcher
oh a dreamcatcher ill buy one
yeah and these here are cherokee hair tampons theyre like tampons made with all-natural hair from the cherokee people
ooh a tampon made from cherokee hair—now that sounds natural
native americans are more in tune with the earth than we are
oh yeah we love the earth man
oh yeah the earth is great
mrs broflovskis son is a little sick perhaps she could bring him in tomorrow and you could give him some spiritual healing
oh sure we could do that man well give him like a a brain enema or somethin
uhhm ho ho hm
wonderful
why dont you follow me over to the cash register and ill take a deposit
dyou have anymore stuff to sell we wanna buy more stuff
yes much much more stuff
sure uh we just gotta go back to our truck- im i mean our horses and grab some more junk come on
good-bye native americans the spirit of maya is with you
oh yah you too and junk
thats funny man
oh hi stanley look im buying you some more all-natural toothpaste
you mean the stuff that tastes like ass and doesnt fight cavities
thats right
look um i know that you all think the earth and its natural healing powers can cure kyle but the doctor at the hospital told me it cant
well of course the doctor told you that because he wants to make money holistic medicine is about nature two-hundred and thirty-three dollars
everythings going to be fine stan were bringing kyle in tomorrow to see the native americans personally
isnt it possible that these indians dont know what theyre talking about
you watch your mouth stanley the native americans were raped of their land and resources by white people like us
and that has something to do with their medicines because
enough stanley
nobody wants to listen kenny
(i know)
i dont know what else to do i mean he could die kenny and that means wed never see him again
(uh huh)
i guess maybe ive always taken friends for granted like theyd always be there if a friend died i dont know what id do well im not just gonna stand here and watch my friend die kenny go round up all the kids in town who want to help kyle round them up and meet me at the bus stop at 730 kyles gonna live
(rrrh)

god-dammit dont you care that kyle is gonna die
i do i do care look how much look look how much i care
first and foremost mr garrison i would like to thank you for choosing harequin romance
yeah yeah yeah so did you read the book
uh yes mr garrison we did read your book
well what did you think
well uh frankly mr garrison n-we dont know if the harequin romance label is appropriate for you
ooohhh why not
mr garrison uh are you aware that the word "penis" occurs six-thousand and eighty-three times in your novel
well im sure theres lots of naughty words it is a romance novel
nnnno i dont think that this book really qualifies as a "romance novel"
no
no no this is what we in the book-publishing business like to call gay really really gay
what the hell are you talkin about
its just that the focus really seems to be on the male organs
well i thought it was mostly women that read these things
it is
well women want to read about ding-dongs dyou think women care about the details of female anatomy hell no women wanna read about big powerful schlongs look ive seen women read these things they skim along and skim along until they get to the part about the penis thats what they want so thats what im giving them
hmmm
theres nothing more i can do kenny ive tried everything to save kyle holistic medicine is gonna kill my friend
(you never seem to care when i die)
my friend is gonna die hes gonna die and theres nothing i can do about it oh god hes my best friend
(well now that does it i have had enough of this bullshit screw you stan im going home)
look out oops
awgh ill never see kyle again
four dozen cherokee hair tampons please
no problem man pay miss information up front
hi uh i have a little bit of pain in my balls whenever i watch vh1
oh here try this man ah this is allll-naturalll ball juice
wow i feel better already
and next we have mrs broflovskis son
okay here he is
ahahem that kid looks really sick
yes he really needs his toxins flushed again
no i mean he looks really sick man you should take him to like a doctor
hmm
but youre more in touch with the earth
look bein in touch with the earth has nothing to do with dyin man
its okay we trust that you know what youre doing
no man that kid needs a doctor and besides were not actually native americans i mean im- im more like a- a mexican
what
hu-uh
yeah a mexican
uugh ptu ptu
i didnt know that
oh my god
how dare you deceive us like that
hey we never said we were native americans man miss information said that
yeah she said nobody would buy anything from mexicans
uh toxins are your enemy
kill her
funny
so now can we take kyle to the hospital
yes of course but we dont have a kidney donor
thats alright if youll all help i think i have a plan
