well eric you should be proud that people wanna be like you ha ah i mean you really started something
i guess
well if these people look up to you maybe maybe you can sort of set the record straight and show them the way its supposed to be done
youre right butters maybe i can actually use all these people somehow to make real food critics respected again
harrison yates whats gotten into you
thats it maggie im hanging it up if people are gonna be trying all the new restaurants in town theyll have to do it without my reviews
what are ya talkin about you said that protectin people from bad dinin experiences was what kept you goin
the restaurants put up signs sayin i cant come in i dont know why they singled me out but its like people dont need me well ill be damned
what is it
somebodys put a note in the mailbox asking me to come and talk to them they do need me i need to get goin
you want me to come along
no theyre just asking for me i guess maybe i do have a town to protect
oh are you having a party sweetheart
not a part mom ive invited all the poser food critics over for a meeting
oh how fun
its not fun its serious these people think they can do what i do but they need to be made to understand the reality when the yelpers get here i need you to get lost okay okay thats them thats them go get lost mom
hello hi my name is and im here for the meeting
is this the right place
fuuuuuuck mom
im going honey
but mom theres like a billion people here
oh yes sweetie i think quite a few people are yelp reviewers
oh this many people have nothing better to do than write reviews on yelp
i guess so honey do you need more lemonade
mom theres a fucking billion people here uh thank you all for coming my name is eric and as you know us yelpers are being scrutinized-
could you speak a little louder
yes us yelp critics are being scrutinized
thats right yeah
now you see the problem is that when theres too many reviewers people no longer know who is the real food critic its great that you all want to be critics but we all know who the real food analyst of the town is
thats right yeah
huh oh thanks
okay so as long as there is one clear leader then the rest of you can just follow and with this many people all following one captain we can fight to get our power back
poweerrrrr back
so now rise up and fight for your leader fight together and show the restaurants that our food critic does matter
yeah lets go
alright follow me
this way everyone
another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by yelp reviewers whistlin willys a child favorite in town was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded the following video is graphic
no please no nonono awwww
we all loved whistlin willys
it didnt do well with yelpers
you assholes destroyed the best place in town because they wouldnt kiss your asses
oh come on admit it the food sucked
nobody went for the fucking food
look im sorry goys but whistlin willy failed to recognize the influence someone like me has on their business now i just have one question for you david do you ride your teeny tiny bicicleta to school
si me ride me teeny bicicleta to school
youre done
yeah im done im now the leader of thousands of people they all hang on my every word and im gonna use my power to finally get what this town really needs
i found the wait staff at red lobster to be rude and barely even acknowledging who i was or what i meant to this city
gerald im taking ike to clown school you care to joing us
i cant honey im now the leader of thousands of people they all hang on my every word and im going to use my power to finally get what this town really needs
for the fifth day in a row historic shi tpa town is under siege by yelp reviewers the restaurants are still refusing to be intimidated and the yelp reviewers are- -and the yelp reviewers are preparing for all-out war the angry yelp reviewers are demanding special treatment at all city restaurants they claim that as local food critics they deserve respect and that all who oppose them will suffer the online restaurant critics are getting ready to bring businesses to their knees and some are already closing their doors
one local restaurant worker actually called out the yelp critics leader
i guess you win huh big shot if you really are any kind of important to anybody then get your bullshit food critic ass to the south of town and face me because you arent a food critic and you arent important and unless youre a chicken ill see you south of town
where are you going sir
you heard him little mexican kid called me out if he wants to fight me thats fine
you need backup sir
no hes just calling me out
god bless you sir
i know
david dude wait dude you dont wanna do this you dont know what cartmans capable of
where i come from we settle things with our fists
but this isnt mexico
im not from mexico dude im from idaho im gonna show this prick how we do things in boise
oh hello david
alright youve got your army youve got your followers if youre such a great leader then just tell the city what you want fat-ass
dont call me fat son im doing this because theyve-
what i want is to be able to lead these fine people with the respect and the dignity-
i didnt ask to be the leader i was appointed you see im extremely important to this town and im not going to be-
my journey is this towns food-
youve made these people feel unwanted and now they look to me for answers
now here i stand vulnerable afraid and yet willing to do what the people of this-
and so we said "to hell with it" and we took the challenge to go from the towns food critics to the towns spiritual leaders what do we want
people would say "oh youre just a food blogger youre just a tiny voice in the crowd well now my voice is heard and i will-"
wanted special privileges but these people think i should have them right guys maybe i dont deserve special treatment but how else can i be the elite food critic they want
every person here thinks this is about them
i think i know what to do
yeah me too
and for all your service to this community we want to once and for all declare you our most elite food critic to distinguish you we present to you the golden badge wearing this badge means you will always get the special treatment that you deserve
