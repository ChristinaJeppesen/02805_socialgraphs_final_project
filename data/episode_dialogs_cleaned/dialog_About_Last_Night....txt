yes we do assemble the rest of the team weve only got ten hours

actually the hard parts just starting
yoohoo

what are you a mccain voter
yeah
sorry pal but obamas president now obama obama
obama obama
yeah yeah flip the flip the cop car flip the cop car
ey put down my car
yes we can
no no hey stop it
jesus christ
o-bama youre so fine youre so fine you blow my mind hey obama hey obama
hey you guys wanna buy a tv
bravo obama and mccain ten years you two have been working on this plan and youve finally pulled it off
guys weve all known each other a long time had many incredible adventures but this is going to be our greatest feat ever
i knew it i knew when you two ran for president you were just working an angle
always workin the angles
my friends while the entire country is busy reacting to the election we are about to pull off the greatest heist in human history
so come on enlighten us what are we stealing this time
the hope diamond rated #4 of the ten most precious diamonds in the world going street value middle-eastern market of course two hundred and ten million dollars
two hundred ten
million
no no no the hope diamond is ungettable every thief in the world knows that
almost ungettable the diamond is kept in the smithsonian natural history museum long considered to be the most thief-proof structure ever built the diamond wing is protected by impenetrable walls of two-foot wide steel on the northeast side a seven-five laser system theres simply no side of the smithsonian that can be breached
so you go in from the roof drop into it from the top
cant get it to from the top because a polymer shelf runs the entire expanse
okay you cant get into the museum from any side and you cant drop in from above so you cant get the diamond
meet the presidential escape tunnel a two-mile long underground passage that runs from the white house to a location outside the city limits in case of an attack the tunnel is only accessible from the oval office and just happens to travel right underneath the smithsonian natural history museum
boom baby
you get somebody into that tunnel they can blast into the museum let the others in the heist is on
so you both run for president because one of you has to win and youve got your access to the tunnel
and we run on a particularly brutal campaign so that the nation is as distracted as possible over the next eight hours
this all sounds very risky
weve spent ten years putting this plan together if we are indeed the greatest thief club in the world-
and we are
-we wont get caught
yes ah im trying to locate my parents m-my name is kyle broflovski yes i know obama won
kyle kyle you gotta get out here
what
your little brother has climbed out of the window i i think hes gonna jump
oh my god
ike dont do it theres still so much to live for i know you really wanted mccain to win but but its going to be okay no thats not true ike the economy could easily stabilize with obamas plan ike dont jump you could really hurt your ankle or something really ike thats like five feet off the ground dont do it
