yeah
lets do this one two
backyard wrestling
oh what a perfect night for fighting lo the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and i the man known as the rad russian start to stir with the excitement of violence
only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent rad russian but you dont know what real pain is pain like ive known abandoned when i was four years old by my parents left to die in a cold and dark sewage tunnel
gee i didnt know his parents did that
shhh
im very sorry but im afraid we have to terminate your employment here at south park elementary
youre firing me why
the school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program wrestling simply involves too much adult subject matter like murder and abortion
no this isnt wrassling this isnt wrassling principal victoria just let me stay on and i can teach kids what real wrassling is
im sorry the board has made up their minds
you cant fire me for what these kids do
that isnt the only reason youre being let go
what do you mean
we found all the gay porn on your iphone mr conners
so im thinking we do the part about jimmys relationship with his alcoholic father after you smash butters onto the table
oh sure that works
you guys you guys listen to this its amazing
what dude
we just received a letter from the wwe
from the professional wrestlers we saw in denver
no way
"gentlemen we have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity the wwe is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout president vince mcmahon to view your wrestling event this saturday the twenty-fourth"
vince mcmahon is coming to see us
this is our shot at making it into the wwe to be real wrestlers
omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod omigod
oh my god oh my god
i cant believe its him
im freaking out
omigod omigod omigod
okay guys guys listen we seriously have to focus here we have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle we gotta step it up and work it like never before
alright its time to start the second act lets bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for saturday
yeah no i i think congo is a great wrestler i just think rad russian has his number
yeah but rad russian has a lot of abandonment issues
uh oh it looks like the intermission is over better head back
i left my wife today walked out of the apartment without saying a word i ran away from my responsibilities just like i always do and i again am alone
here he is hiding in the forest as i told you
juggernaut there is to be an ultimate smackdown this saturday are you going to run from that as well
ill fight anytime anywhere
he dont run from fights just from responsibilities
oohhhhh boooooooo
what do i do juggernaut is my long lost brother and yet congo saved my life in nam
its el pollo loco
thanks for coming guys im sure youre wondering why ive called you here to sizzler
yeah whats this about we should be writing our monologues for smackdown
well guys kenny and i have been talking
(yeah weve been talking)
and i mean smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the wwe right i mean a shot like this might never come again
yeah
well the way we see it we have three primary obstacles in making smackdown a great show tolkien butters jimmy
(yep)
what are you talking about
guys lets face it they cant wrestle for crap i mean every time i wrestle with one of them they flub a line or blow their monologue and tolkien he has no emotion no timing hes the worst wrestler ive ever seen
hes right
what
dude its really hard to do your best wrestling when youre up against tolkien
right
and butters and jimmy i mean theyre okay but theyre never gonna make it as professional wrestlers
well so then wwe will recruit us and not them
no dude theyre gonna hurt our chances
(theyre gonna hurt our chances)
because we all know that the new material ive written is stuff those guys cant handle and well suffer from it
so what do we do
(weve gotta bring somebody else on)
yep weve gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys
somebody who can do the harder stuff weve written so that tolkien butters and jimmy can have smaller parts
how do we find somebody who can wrestle that well
its simple we just gotta hold tryouts
number seventeen step forward please youre wrestling a muslim immigrant you suspect he could be a terrorist and your parents died in the 9/11 attacks go
