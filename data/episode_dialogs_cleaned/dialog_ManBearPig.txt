yyeah you know mr gore uh my dads a geologist and he said that manbearpig probably isnt in colorado
what does your dad look like does he have large hooves where his feet should be
no
damn for a minute there i thought we found him
well this was a great meeting wasnt it guys but we gotta get goin to school now
oh my god manbearpig screen active what is this area of colorado its a its a cave of some kind
yeah thats cave of the winds its a tourist attraction
oh jesus on ice skates weve gotta get down there right away
ah i dont think so dude
yeah weve got school anyway
i can get you all excused from school
you have that kind of power
look you boys have a chance to help me find and kill manbearpig once and for all im totally serial
hello everyone welcome to cave of the winds our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in colorado before we get started i do understand we have a special guest in our group today the ex vice president mr al gore mr gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here now once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules stay on the path and do not touch anything aright are we ready
yeah
lets go cavin
here we are in the main chamber of the cave it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the old west
have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately
ahh no now as you can see the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites water drips from the caves
all right kids i need you to keep an eye out for manbearpig droppings
what do manbearpig droppings look like
similar to pig droppings but more manbearlike
these rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name for instance this one here we named "the hanging mushroom" and over here we have "man with helmet and two bowling balls" and finally of course the "two sisters" now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees
groan groan
sir mr gore is there a problem
not yet
all right everyone if youll step this way youll see how the cave gets its name
kids kids over here look
what
i bet this is where hes hiding this looks like manbearpig central come on come on this is where manbearpig is im serial
in certain areas of the cave the wind actually blows through causing a sound you can hear
wow
take a picture of the sound steven
mr gore i i think we should stay with the tour group
wait shhh christ hes here take this rope be ready to tie him up ive got you now you son of a bitch
what are you doing
oh no
no
aaaah
leave them alone you goddamned manbearpig

damn you manbearpig theyre just children
o-kay everyone out of the cave now go go go out now
hello

were trapped in here
somebody get us some help down hyah
hello help
hello
(hello)
help
forget it they cant hear us
(what are we gonna do)
youd better get us out of here asshole
me
you just had to go and be nice to al gore now were trapped in a cave
maybe theres another way out of here
(oh no kidding)
a-all right lets split up and look for a passageway e-everyone take a different direction oh man were in big trouble here
this is bullcrap if im thin- im gonna be so pissed off goddammit
you see anything kenny
(no nothing)
cartman cartman you see anything
no nothing no nothing here nothing this way tr treasure
cartman you okay you need help
im fine this way is just a dead end coming back to you now
it looks like were completely sealed in
(yeah no shit)
theres a small passageway about 200 yards over there but it goes for a long long way and its pretty steep
maybe we should go for it
you guys go on ahead im gonna stay here wait it out
why
i just i i dont feel very good ill just wa- ill just weigh you guys down
cartmans right first rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued
no its okay you guys go on ahead
no well stay here too if we start wandering off were gonna get lost or killed lets just wait here and hope help comes soon
thats cool i just i just wouldnt go over there if i were you guys i just took a huge dump
aw dude
the cave-in was massive it has cut off all access in or out the children are believe to be trapped somewhere in this area
does anybody know who these kids are
no nobody seems to knew them only that they were in the tour group digging to them is going to take days
excuse me excuse me this cave-in was no accident and it isnt going to stop unless we move fast i am super duper serial
what do you mean the cave-in is over
im afraid you have a much bigger problem than a cave-in
whats that
what is that a pigbearman
no stupid its manbearpig
im sooo hungry do you think people even know were here
they saw us on the tour dude where do you keep going cartman
i just n-need to keep taking a crap i got diarrhea really bad
dude its bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes
lets just try to sleep maybe help will come tomorrow
all that treasure its all mine so long as these greedy assholes dont find out about it you would all just looove to get your hands on my treasure wouldnt you even though i found it youd love to think its somehow yours too god i hate you guys especially you you money-grubbing snake in the grass well i have news for you kyle youre never going to get my treasure ive got a little plan going to get the treasure out of here without you ever knowing
c-cartman
oh hey kyle hows it goin
dude what are you doing
not much you know just hangin out howve you been man good
dude get away from me
yeah its nice talking with you kyle see you around
why wont anybody listen to me manbearpig is in there and we have to kill him while we all have the chance im serial
mr gore please we need you to calm down now w-what exactly do you suggest we do
i told you we need to fill the cave with hot molten lead cause its the only way to make sure manbearpig never comes out and im sane and im totally serial but everyone just keeps digging
well see the problem is that if we fill the caves with hot molten lead it will kill those boys too
theyre already dead didnt you listen to me they got attacked by a manbearpig and manbearpig leaves nobody alive im super serial nobody will listen to me but im serial
do you want me to get the ex vice president out of here
naw i f- i feel kind of bad for him i dont think he has any friends
all right gotta be strong theres still a lot more treasure to go
dude hes really sick
its been three days since four unidentified children were trapped in a cave-in three days without food and time is certainly running out the digging continues but progress is fatally slow
all right people weve gotta work faster our best estimate still puts us three days from reaching the area of the cave called smugglers den
smugglers den
ih its a room near the end of the tour where you can get your picture taken with fake treasure here see
based on where the boys were seen last theyre somewhere near this area hopefully theyve followed the first rule of survival and stayed put
stan stan wake up
huh what have they come for us
no its cartman somethings really wrong with him
meh meuh urgh mbeuh
oh my god cartman dude can you hear me
im fahn just a lit- no big deal beh
we cant wait here any longer dude weve gotta get him out of here or hes gonna die
how dude we c- we dont even know if that passage i found goes anywhere
maybe we should get out first see if we can find a way out and then come back for him
no dont dont leave me here you assholes dont leave me here to die
come on come on pull
goddamnit hes soo heavy
buh hurry you guys you gotta get me out of here

yes you do
what the hell is that oh my god
no let me out of here let me out of here you guys
ruuun

youre calling off the rescue
we didnt plan on a freak river flood god must really want those kids dead
well what if the children arent dead
look the cavern is completely flooded nothing could have survived theres nothing left alive down there
nothing left alive i did it i killed manbearpig ive saved the earth from certain destruction everyone is super-stoked on me even if they dont know it

we are gathered here to say goodbye to four kids whom we all tried to help but in the end could not but where there is loss there is hope for manbearpig is no more
oh jesus here we go again
i have beaten manbearpig and we will never forget the names of the brave young kids who lost their lives kid 1 kid 2 kid 3 and of course kid 4 i remember how kid 1 used to laugh and play and how kid 2 was always there when i needed him
agh
oh my god
its the kids
theyre alive
kids i saved you
just stay away from us asshole i was nice to you because i felt sorry for you because you dont have any friends but now i see why you dont have any friends you just used manbearpig as a way to get attention for yourself because youre a loser
