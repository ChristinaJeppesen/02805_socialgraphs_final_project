children children to honor this special time of year well be doing a canned food drive does anybody know what a canned food drive is
yes eric
when they cut up a chicks stomach to get a baby out
noo thats a caesarian section eric but thats okay remember there are no stupid questions just stupid people
a canned food drive is when we collect canned food for poor people who cant afford to eat on thanksgiving
you mean like kenny
exactly
mr garrison why do poor people always smell like sour milk
i dont know eric they just do
now children i want each of you to bring in one can of food and later the mayor of south park will divide it up amongst kennys family and other poor people
im not bringin in food for poor people screw them
dont you want to help those who are less fortunate
hey you guys do you hear something ah- i think i hear the flower children calling
this is the one time of year youre supposed to care about people who cant eat
isnt it enough that i pay taxes what about the poor houses that that i pay for
many would rather die than go to those places
well then perhaps they should and decrease the surplus population
okay kids thats enough dickens for one day lets get on with our lesson right mr hat
thats right mr garrison englebert humperdink was the first person on the moon who was the second
aaaah
what the hell is going on
aaaah
well you dont see that everyday
okay now once we have all the canned foods collected well need some clever way to distribute them to the poor
it should be something festive
mayor weve got a very big problem
ahh youre that insane genetic engineer from up on the hill right
yes and i may have made a horrible mistake i was trying to genetically engineer turkeys for thanksgiving
uh huh
you know to provide food for the needy
of course
well something went wrong and the turkeys broke free and the worst part is theyre really pissed off
naturally
oh do go on
we have to stop them or or they could destroy everything time is short
you were saying
they act just like normal turkeys except theyre evil
oh my
somehow i dont think youre taking me seriously
uh now why would you say that
did it come did it come is it here yet
i get to use it first you guys mom did our digital sports watch come yet

okay thank you very much yes you can pick him up tonight bye now
now boys i hope youve learned your lesson
no
you cant care for this child
but i thought we were supposed to care on thanksgiving
yes but you dont actually get involved with the childs life youre supposed to just send money and once in a while they write you a letter you see marvin didnt grow up in a normal place like south park
so why cant he live here now
because he cant
because why
because eight-year olds cant be parents
then you take care of him
i cant i ummim very busy
