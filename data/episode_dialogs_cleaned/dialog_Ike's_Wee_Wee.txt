it was an error of judgment mr mackey but im afraid i have to let you go for it we searched each one of those kids but came up empty

no dude we never even saw it
okay because i just want to tell you that drugs are bad
we know we know thats what everybody says
right but do you know why theyre bad
because theyre an addictive solution to a greater problem causing disease of both body and mind with consequences far outweighing their supposed benefits
and do you have any idea what that means
no
i know drugs are bad because if you do drugs youre a hippie and hippies suck
look children this is all im goin to say about drugs stay away from them theres a time and place for everything and its called college do you understand
dude
