but i thought obama won pretty easily last night
dude because of the electoral college these votes in swing states can really matter
i dont understand that stuff at all i need morgan freeman to explain it to me

agh no please you cant
then just tell me what cartman is up to
okay okay hes helping the chinese get something they want
whatd he say oh well what do you mean the election isnt the biggest thing that happened this week
because the chinese actually want to protect something thats important
what you mean the missile defense program butters wheres cartman supposed to hand over the ballots
at red robster
(at red lobster)
where
red lobster
huh
he said "at ruh ruh rruh ruh reh red"
red lobster
(red lobster)
what
ruh rehh red
red lobster
(red lobster)
oh red lobster
general tso do you have the missing ballots or not
sssure we have the ballots but we dont have them right here with us now
okay you want me to come in again we can start over what the fuck is this
all right where are the missing ballots president obama
oh god damn it kyle i was just about to get what i wanted
mr president we got you reelected now you will give us the star wars technology so that we can make the sequels
i told you china would get the rights to star wars from disney as long as my presidency was secure until i have those ballots it is not secure
wait a minute the rights to star wars the movies what the hell is going on here
whats going on is the sale of americas greatest asset you see when the united states created star wars it made this country incredibly powerful
morgan freeman
earlier this week lucas signed the rights to star wars over to disney and the chinese saw a way to obtain it for themselves the chinese government knew that president obama would help them take the rights from disney if they helped him get reelected
ohhhh
but the child who actually stole the ballots has hidden them and wont give them to anyone until his demands are met youve all got quite a mess on your hands i wish you well with it
hey just one thing morgan freeman how come every time something convoluted needs explaining you show up
because every time i show up and explain something i earn a freckle
so heres the deal general tso mr president when the chinese make the sequels i get to play the part of luke skywalkers son cartman skywalker
that was not the deal we will not be a-bullied by you
well then i guess were about to play a game of chicken general tso
heheh i get it general tsos chih-chih-chicken
you are absolutely sure about this
its been confirmed mike my god we might have won this thing
sir sir we have some incredible news there are rumors of hundreds of thousands of stolen ballots you might have won the election after all
theres nothing here kyle
anything in the basement jimmy
just old junk and boxes of erics moms d-dildos
well keep looking
oh my goodness whats going on
sorry ms cartman but your son took some things that didnt belong to him
oh ive told him to respect peoples property what did he take
he stole ballots in all the swing states so the wrong person was elected president
oh well no tv for him for a few days
theres nothing here kyle not even one s-s-scooby clue
oh my god you guys look dude its boba fetts ship
just what the dickens is going on here haha
aw shit its him again
whats this about a deal with the chinese i own all this shit now i own the death star i own tatooine its all mine haha all right fuckers where are the missing ballots haha
butters you just couldnt keep your mouth shut could you butters
i didnt say anything i promise
i guess we learned that when it comes to star wars we cant trust anyone not the president not the chinese and not you
please eric i tried to be quiet i swear
shhh its okay butters nobodys gonna find the election ballots i have them hidden away somewhere nobody would ever look a place in town people barely even know exists
hey guys lookin to buy a hummer today were havin a rocktober sales event day thats goin into rockvember hey there interested in test-drivin a hummer today i can see you with the ray-bans got that nice bicep haning out the window rolled down whattaya think rockvember sales event guys every hummer comes with a free segway
hey why dont you shut up
im just excited about all these deals thats all
we found him sir but still no sign of the missing ballots
go on leave us alone haha now listen little boy the reason this country works is because people go out to vote every vote counts and you need-
cut the crap mouse you only care about the election results because romney would have been tougher on the chinese
why dont you just tell me where the missing ballots are it will make your death a lot less painful haha
trust me theyre somewhere nobody will ever find them if you kill me then obama will stay president and you will lose star wars to the chinese forever
pretty neat huh how would you like to have one
i can get those at k-mart if you want me to switch sides youll have to do better than that
like what
i want a part in the new movies
well then why didnt you just come to me in the first place if you wanna be in the next star wars im your guy haha
i get to be luke skeywalkers son and there has to be a character called jewbacca
you can be lukes son you can be han solos son i dont give two shits and a popsicle
really well then i suppose that making the votes public is the right thing to do i can get the ballots for you but if im gonna smuggle them here im gonna need a blaster and a tauntaun
sure thing ive got tauntauns comin out my asshole haha
haha
haha
haha
this is breaking election news hold that phone the election may be over but rumors are running rampant that hundreds of thousands of ballots for mitt romney were stolen
we need everyones help here what youre looking for are big boxes of ballots hundreds of them please check your basement your attic and-
and and you claim that a general tso hired your friend fatass to steal the ballots but so far the chinese are refusing to speak with us
yeah probably cause general tsos chicken
is that it did he just did he just
yup chris were getting confirmation that was the millionth time
excitement and revelry at south park as a little boy has just made the general tsos chicken joke for the one millionth time
what
little boy the general tsos chicken joke a favorite for years youve just hit the magic number how does it feel
i what
hes being presented with the check now a five thousand dollar gift certificate to pf changs this has been a long campaign but someones finally done it wolf
well we tried dude
it just seems so unfair people wont ever even know that the wrong man is in the white house
well i mean look at it this way almost half the country did actually vote for obama if the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes cartman stole then does it matter that much
it matters stan it it matters
ho ho ho hoo come on down to stevenson hummer for our big christmas in humvember sale not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season why not give them a nice hummer nothing beats a hummer on christmas morning
stan when was the last time you saw somebody drive a hummer
uhhh forever ago like 2010
oh my god
hey looking for a hummer today got some 2009s here never been driven ever go on get out of here shoo
look there they are
hey hi there you kids like hummers huh let me show you these babies
we found it you guys oh no they followed us
oh hell yes asians hey guys
get out of our way
no these dont belong to you they belong to the people
i am tired of playing games this little farce is ovah
i dont think so general tso this way officers
oh my god its a sales rush
oh my god are those what i think they are
yes we must show these to the public for democracys sake right kyle
sir weve found something at the hummer sales lot outside of town
you dont understand we are trying to protect the greatest film series ever made
protect it
what the hell is going on here
perhaps i can explain it to you you see it turns out the only reason the chinese so desperately wanted star wars is because theyre afraid that disney might not be the right place for it the chinese simply want to guard star wars impeccable legacy
is that morgan freeman
and now were at a crossroads if these ballots are made public then the man the people voted for will be president but he will no doubt keep star wars from the chinese and allow disney to keep it instead and so we have to ask ourselves "whats more important that the right man is elected president or that star wars is with people who will protect it most"
unit 4 what is it over
well kid
well if you put it that way
come in unit 4 what have you found
nothing sir we just found some tremendous deals on cars nobody wants thats all barkley out
no but obama wasnt really elected dont you people care
obama is president again
