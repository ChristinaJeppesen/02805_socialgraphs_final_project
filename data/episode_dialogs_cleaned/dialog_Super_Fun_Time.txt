aw just a few more things
no if we dont leave right now were gonna miss the bus and then theyll know we left
huh i guess youre right butters all right come on
set up the satellite relay check for alternate routes out of the area unfortunately your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us that is unfortunate for you because when i think it is clear to leave we will now need to take hostages with us to ensure our goods get to their final destination
please if you must take anyone dont take me these kids are worth more to you
how did they find us
get the loot out of the car and stash it in that building
all right men listen up looks like our thieves are trying to hide out here theyve got the employees and some school kids held hostage
tucker dylan set up a perimeter
everyone stay on your toes these are professionals were dealing with here
what did they rob sir
a burger king
all right good is that all of it
no dont forget weve got these too
excellent now listen everyone were going to be all right this is only a small hitch in our plan id like to speak with the chief of police who is this this is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesnt get exactly what he wants
why arent the cops coming in
they must be negotiating
them there bandits sure look mighty strange and them pistols is way bigger than whats wes gots
will you shut up
wait you have guns here
sure sheriff got lots of rifles in his office
well why dont you go get them and bring them back here
all righty come on storehand
yeppir
uhaw man i cant wait to see the look on kyles face when we tell him we had super fun time while he was at the dumb pioneer village
were not telling anybody i dont wanna get in trouble and i didnt have a super fun time anyways
butters youve gotta learn to chill life goes by pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while and do whatever you want all the time you could miss it
yeah well i guess thats kinda true
uh oh crap they called the cops on us
what they called the cops
they must have realized we left damn
oh my god the police are looking for us
shhh butters
were gonna get it now
butters butters calm down i know a way out of this
you just got me busted forever
butters l-listen to me listen
no
all we have to do is sneak back inside without the cops seeing us then we can say we were inside all along
you said they wouldnt notice we were gone you promised
if we sneak back inside we can say we never left all right all right now let go of my hand
no
butters
huh you made me break one rule im not breaking the other its all i have now
all right come on
keep the hostages from talking and search for holdouts everyone check in at two-minute intervals i hope you have good news orlich
the police have us completely surrounded on all sides theres no way were gettin out above ground without being spotted
above ground
look i found this at the rear of the park its an old mine shaft but pioneer village was sued when a kid died in it so they closed it down and protected it with a huge meal door with a coded lock
so if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police excellent
one more thing franz i want my share of the take now
whats the matter orlich lose your sense of trust
i was just thinking maybe we get through that tunnel then you take the loot to berlin and i never see you again i want my cut
very well
im going to ask you again what is the door code to the tunnel
i told you mister what would i know about a door code im just a simple blacksmith with my trusty forge i makes all the metalworks for the village ow
you are an employee here that means you are required to know the door code for fire code reasons mister david palmer of colorado springs
huh my name aint palmer its old smithy hand we aint never heard of no fire code why we gots to put fires out ourselves when the- ow
thats it tell me the code or you die one two
i
yes
i dont know nothin about no fancy door code im just a simple blacksmith
these pioneer village workers are really committed to their jobs
no please dont hurt me
give us the code to that door and we can leave
ive never heard of sss-something called a door code please cant you ask some other way
i dont have time for your stupid game tell me or you die right now
all right all right look its just its just one of those jenkins home security locks you press the top button and then and then enter 5-2
what he meant to say kids is that we aint never heard ono fancy door code cause in our time we gots to rely on wood locks and sich
god damn it you people are fucking insane
i dont believe it
domino vosky find out if there are any employees or students wandering about bring them here or shoot them
oh crap weve gotta hide come on
yeah weve gotta geh- geh get the hell outta here f- f-hast fast
sector bravo no activity
jeez uh cops are looking for us everywhere
dont worry theyre not gonna find us til were safely back inside look see that traffic signal down there if we can climb across that we can jump to the tree branch and then were home free
that looks dangerous
not getting busted always is butters come on good thats good thats good good all right then lets head across go easy good
oh gosh in heaven
its all right youve got it no problem- op
whoa

finally a fella that talks some sense
ifn you all was to have such a giant safe what would you villagers want the number to be to unlock that thar jail door shuckamuck

eighteen sixty four orlich we have the door code start packing up well take the hostages with us

too bad youll be going away for a long time was it worth it
in a way it was i might not have gotten away but at least i learned a lot about pioneer life in the old west those early settlers didnt have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today to think how difficult it was back in those times to do somethin as simple as washing your clothes pioneer village has a lot to teach us all
thats true
hey look
teacher my partner is back on the bus
