okay guys its november and who can tell me what that means yes francis
its time for the special ed science fair
thats right the science fair is this weekend and i know youre all very excited to show the projects youve been working on this week well be hearing all about your projects and first up we have nathan and mimallah
for our science fait project we will be showing the destructive force of nature by simulating a volcano
ooooooh
with vinegar and baking soda we will make this paper-mâché volcano explode
aaaaaaa
with the power and fury of mount kilauea our science fair project is sure to be a blast get it a blast
all right what do you guys think of nathan and mimallahs project idea
weve done it mimsy were gonna win the science fair for sure and then every chick in this school is gonna wanna have sex with us
uh gee boss i dont know about sex with no chicken
not those chicks numbskull im talkin bout bitches you know what girls like they like winners and when we win the science fair were gonna be up to our ears in pussy
is it just me or are things around here getting worse and worse
its definitely not just you i think everyones in shock that heidi went back to cartman
what keeps driving her back to him its so weird
shes so mean and angry these days
people change they say you become more and more like the person youre with and i guess its true with heidi
hey guys whats up
hey heidi
what are you guys talkin about
nothing
bullcrap youre all talkin about me again cause youre judgmental bitches ehhh
heidi are you okay its just you look
i look what
ngh you know y-you just look-
what i look fat is that what you wanna say wendy fuck you bitch
shes just concerned heidi
"mehmehmehmehmehhh heidi" im just trying to enjoy my lunch here can i do it without you guys shitting on all over me
all right good timmy test 42a is successful lets move on to the next phase
well hello gentlemen
oh hey fellas were doing great
timmih
thought wed stop by to see how your- science fair project is going
dah i thought we was comin to rub their faces in how good our science fair project was boss
shut up mimsyyy so what are you guys workin on
oh its fantastic this year tim-tim and i are doin our project on water bears
oh water bears you hear that mimsy like theres any such things as water bears that blue science fair ribbon is as good as ours well weve gotta get back to our lava volcano good luck finding your pft water bears
oh would you like to see them
what uh what are you talking about
timmy and i have gathered thousands of water bears take a look in the microscope water bears are water-dwelling eight-legged micro-animals
timmah
theyre one of natures most resilient animals studies have shown they can survive lava and even the vacuum of space
what- how- where the fuck did you learn about these things
where all good scientists learn from octonauts
octonauts
some scientists believe the study of water bears is key to human survival
aw jeez that sounds a lot better than a lava volcano huh boss
well not really because the science fair is supposed to be an experiment i fail to see what the experiment is here
oh thats easy you see for the past several weeks tim-tim and me have been training the water bears to respond to different sound waves we found that they respond best to taylor swift hit it timmy take a look we still have some training to do but were excited about the results i have to admit your lava volcano is pretty great too maybe we could tie for first place
come in
you wanted to see me mr mackey
oh yes heidi uh we just wanted to see if you have transportation to the special ed science fair this weekend or if you wanted us to set somethin up for you
what
uh saturday is the science fair and youre the judge for the competition
judge a special needs science fair ahem no thanks
well heidi is there a problem with you bein the judge this weekend
uhh yeah its saturday and i dont wanna be at skewl
but youre always the judge of the special ed science fair because youre our best science student
so now im gonna be punished by being force to judge a bunch of handicapped kids
but okay you see the problem is that you volunteered last month heidi you said you wanted to do it mkay
well how can you expect students to commit to things a month in advance i dont even know what i want for dinner tonight
look the kids have worked really hard and have done some amazing projects
youre gonna force me to come to skewl on a saturday
heidi eh is everything all right
oh what are you gonna call me fat now too it just so happens im a vegan which means itd difficult for me to get enough protein so my body doesnt burn fat it burns muscle which makes it look like im fat but im actually way healthier than any of you
heidi youre judging the special ed science fair this weekend
oh goddammit
mimsy come on
okay nathan
shhh shut the fuck up
gee we could get in a lot of trouble ya you sure we should mess with jimmy and timmys science fair project
mimsy do you know what jimmy is hes a cock blocker
eh whats a cock blocker
every time i come up with a way to score with the ladies theres jimmy tryin to one-up me this science fair is supposed to finally make us successful enough to get chicks
daw gee i dont know if we should use our position of power to exploit women
im not letting those assholes win the science fair thats why i say the only good water bears are dead water bears lets go
this is bullcrap how can they force me to be the science fair judge now i know how it feels to be a slave
its not exactly like being a slave heidi
yes it is am i being paid to judge the science fair no do i have a choice no "ohhh yes masah lemme judge that science fair for ya suh"
god will you stop
theresa dont get all aggro on me because youre pissed off your family lives in a trailer
my family doesnt live in a trailer we live in a tiny home my parents downsized to make a smaller footprint on the environment
thats what i said your family lives in a trailer
theres lots of progressive people living in tiny homes theres five others on my block
right thats called a "trailer park"
a-hi dont live in a trailer park
just dont even respond to her just ignore her
ill try but shes such a bitch
she wasnt talking to you heidi
oh looks like isla has something to say you guys hold on im sure this is going to be really profound go ahead isla knock us out with you wit and satire this should be good you guys
hey heidi whats up
oh hey babe whats going on
what are you up to
nothiiing just talking to my girlfriends about tiny homes
well hello there ladies
oh hi nathan
we just wanted to remind you that this weekend is the special ed science fair
oh cool
yeah thats right pretty soon youll all be impressed with what you see hope you can make it did you see that mimsy the way those girls bit their bottom lips when i said "science fair" were about to be drowning in muff
nathan mimallah yuh youve gotta get to special ed
special ed class isnt for another two hours
nono youve gotta see this jimmy and timmys water bears theyve changed
what
jimmy and timmy this is incredible youve somehow made them even smarter
whats goin on
nathan its amazing the water bears weve trained are starting to display social advancements
but theyre supposed to be dead
what social advancement
theyve actually evolved to the point of doing the hokey pokey
the hokey pokey youve gotta be fucking kidding me
boys this might be the single greatest special ed science fair project ive ever seen
butters
whoa uh hey
how would you like to be the judge for the special ed science fair this weekend
uhh i cant im going to a birthday party
butters dont be a dick
yeah dont make up excuses because judging handicapped students sounds terrible
yeah butters god
hes not making it up its my birthday party
well then could you invite heidi please she needs an excuse not to have to go to the special needs science fair
whats wrong with supporting them theyre our friends
because nobody wants to be trapped in a gym with special ed science
actually some of their projects are pretty cool
shut up kyle samesies
look its all just a complete waste of time its not like the special ed science fair is actually gonna contribute to society
move move aside kids official business
move it children
excuse me can i help you
we understand that youre about to have a science fair with some very interesting experiments
thats right the science fair is this saturday from 10 am to 2 pm
were here to help however we can your special ed department has all our resources and all our support this science fair just might be what saves us all
what the hell is going on everywhere i turn people are being given handouts while im forced to work my ass off its total bullshit
yeah uh babe uh i understand that youre pissed off but um you know it is recess maybe we should relax and have some fun
relax how can i relax i get straight as i ace every test and who gets all the support the special ed department
good bring it on in these kids need to have access to everything they need
wow look at this tim-tim theyve all been researching water bears too
thats correct like you weve come to realize that water bears are the key to our future are these the special water bears that we read about on your school message board
thats right the water bears weve been working with appear to be evolving somehow
then they are the key to our survival boys
gentlemen perhaps i can interest you in a lava volcano you wont believe your eyes when i add some simple baking soda
theres no time for that we need everyone working on jimmy and timmys project im gonna let you kids all in on a little secret we dont wanna create a panic but the end is very near and we have very little time
fellow students i have asked to speak today because of the hypocrisy and bullying that is coming from the administration at this so called skewl it is an outrage that our principal and counselor denand our participation in privileged programs that are outrageously overfunded why is it that the school allows funding that only goes to special needs students are the rest of us not special if we are continually asked to work for no money and ask our parents to pay for our programs then soon we will all be poor and forced to live in a trailer park like theresa
its not a trailer
theresa get over it you live in a trailer park its not a big deal
uh o-okay honey youre kind of getting off-topic sweetie
what did you say
uh just uh-uhm i just want you to stay on point so we can get this over with
get this over with youre supposed to be supporting me
i am supporting you sweetheart
being supportive doesnt mean you criticize me asshole just forget it my point is if the school administration doesnt cancel the science fair i will see to it that they are all fired for discrimination
shes kind of like cartman but with the ability to follow through
oh dude bro
francis can you hand me the sound wave generator
this is bullshit the special ed science fair is turning into a lovefest for jimmy and timmys project theyre gonna get all the fame and glory
daw i guess we kind of shot ourselves in the foot huh boss if it werent for us those water bears wouldnt have even gotten smarter in the first place
hey mimsy thats right they dont deserve the credit we do uh excuse me if youre all trying to figure out why these water bears are different youre talking to the wrong guys
wha-what do you mean nathan
mimsy and i did some experimenting with the water bears on our own
we was tryin to kill em
it was us who made them evolve so we should be the ones working for the government
the government wuh we arent the government
yuh youre not the government but you said you were here to help stop us from becoming extinct
not you us were with the nfl our fans are leaving at an exponential rate weve been hit with anthem protests protests of those protests and worst of all concussions the more reports that come out the more people are getting turned off by football weve been experimenting with water bears because we believe they are our last hope
oh i get it youve been experimenting with water bears to see how to make humans more impervious to concussions
no weve been experimenting with water bears to try and make them fans
a beautiful night for football here in los angeles as the chargers take on the buffalo bills
and a record sellout crowd here at the stadium football clearly more popular than over with a whopping 17 million in attendance
the nfl of course working really hard to reach new viewers and it looks like they found their answer in tardigrades
the water bears are thrilled to be here and of course love seeing themselves on the jumbotron theyre all ready for some football and enjoying the fan favorite kiss cam
and were ready for kickoff as the cheers of 17 million fans rock the stadium
were running out of time we have to see if these water bears truly are different insert the box gently what do you see now
ahhh iii see the box what whats in the box
what are the water bears doing
uhhh theyre just walkin around and ubb oh wait they appear to be interested in the box
these water bears are different
all right everyone listen up give me your attention please due to circumstances beyond our control we are cancelling the special ed science fair
what cancelling
you cant cancel the science fair were on the verge of a breakthrough here
its cancelled you guys can get all this shit out of here and leave thank you
you dont understand the special ed science fair is our only hope
oh im sorry but um our hands are tied by heidi
i think you all fail to see the seriousness of our situation football is dying
whoa whoa whoa okay
close the door everyone back to work nobody will stop this special ed science fair
do what he says
oh uh okay jesus christ
are you just gonna stand there do something
what the hell do you want me to do
i want you to have some balls and act like you care about me
heidi you need to stop being such a bitch
call me a bitch again do it call me a bitch again
you are acting like a bad girlfriend
thats what i thought
hey uh wait a minute the water bears have changed again i think its working
let me see that yes yes theyre starting to adapt sonofabitch we just might have ourselves some fans now quickly children we must replicate these water bears to create more
if nobody else is going to do anything i will
wha-ah

heidi youve gotta stop being so angry
look if you- if you dont do it for the nfl what about humanity those creatures are showing the first signs of sentience think about what they could mean for science for medicine making people better
come on babe we all want the old heidi back
screw all you guys
noooo
dude wwow
