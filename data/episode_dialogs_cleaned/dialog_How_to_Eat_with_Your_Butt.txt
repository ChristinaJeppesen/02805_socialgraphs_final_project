our ssson
and so thats when i called out to my husband i just knew the boy picture on your milk carton was our little tommy
yes i see uh but the child on the milk carton was reported missing not found
we realize that but we just thought that maybe someone else had found tommy and then lost him again were pretty certain that its our boy considering his physical appearance martha and i have the same condition
riiight
you may not have realized this but we actually have buttocks where our heads should be
really
yes
steven and i have a condition called "torsonic polarity syndrome" its a birth defect thats passed on genetically
over eleven people worldwide suffer from tps
hmm hmm thats am- thats amazing
martha and i were lucky enough to meet each other at a tps convention in france
so do you have heads down where your rear ends should be
no no dont be silly you see with tps the birth defect is on the exterior only behind this we still have all our vital head organs - tongue eyes nasal passages
well mr and mrs
uh thompssson
thompson uh ill contact the young boy who gave me the photo and perhaps we can all visit him together
oh wonderful steven were goin to see tommy again
now martha what did i say about getting our hopesss up
youre right youre right
okay cartman what do you want this time
oho you guys you guys oh my god okay okay so get this get this the milk company calls me right and they call me and say that two people from wisconsin saw the picture of kenny on the milk carton and they think its their kid
dude thats not funny if theyre missing their son
no nonono because apparently these two people also kind of look like they have butts where their heads should be
nuh uh
oh yes and the best part is theyre coming here to my house and its gonna be sooo funny oh jesus thats probably them now okay you guys just play it cool just play it- just-sshh no sshh you guys sshh just- okay no okay okay no you guys sh sh

cartman where are you going
uh excuse me boys do you know anything about this
uh
oh boy
eh-heh l-look if you want an explanation you youd better go to kennys house
yeah he lives about four houses away in the bad side of town
oh thank you thank you
well
they said to inquire four houses down
lets hurry
ehheh cartman what the hell are you doing
yeah you missed them turning around
you guys somethings wrong
what
i think i just saw the funniest thing ill ever see and i think i blew a funny fuse
blew a funny fuse
it was just too much and my sense of humor overloaded i dont think anything will ever be funny again oh god what have i got
you mean they both have butts instead of heads
yeah dude well show you theyre over at kennys
how do they eat
how the hell should we know
butters hey butters you have to check this out
w-what
you gotta come to kennys house with us
theres these two people with asses where their heads should be
ahah-i cant fellas ah-im grounded for lookin stupid in my school picture
but dude you gotta see it its hysterical
butters cant come out and play boys he thinks its funny to look like a jackass in his school pictures that i have to pay for
huh but i told you mom ah-i didnt mean to look like a jackass eh it just happened
you made a goofy face
no thats just what i look like see
dont you make that face at me young man
im not makin a face mom
stop it
come on we wanna see the ass people
alright
fine butters if you dont wanna stop making that stupid face at me you can just stay in your room for another week
another week i hate my stupid face
okay eric as your counselor uh i want you to feel comfortable talking about anything mkay
mr mackey is it possible that you can see something so funny that it ruins your sense of humor forever
well i cant think of anything that would be that funny
two people with asses for heads ever since i saw them i cant laugh at anything
oh i see well well what did you used to think was funny
you know all the usual stuff dirty jokes funny movies seeing someone die this morning i even saw a little girl get her fingers caught in a car door and i couldnt laugh i mean i i knew it was funny but i couldnt laugh
well eric i suppose that just like everything else laughter can be relative - in in other words sometimes people see somethin so scary that nothin else scares them so the same could be true for funny things
so does that mean ill never laugh again
its possible hmkay but you know if you have completely lost your sense of humor you can always become a writer for the show "friends" ohokahay huhuh
ugh
and so you see our son was just playing a joke and the little fat kid put it on the carton
yes yes i see
kenny dont you think you owe the thompsons an apology
no it was foolish for us to get our hopes up
it was just such a coincidence considering the photo you may not have realized this but martha and i have buttocks where our heads should be
really
mr and mrs thompson how long has it been since youve seen your son
tommy disappeared when he was only seven
oh steven its like its all happening all over again
there there now
please mrs thompson itll be alright listen the south park dairy company is the countrys largest we find lost children all the time we can help you find tommy with the companys database
yes well aaah-ill help you find your son just stop cryin please for the love of god stop cryin
ah agh im sorry im sorry
mr thompson how did your son become missing was he abducted
yes he was in the care of our nanny at the time
the nanny that we trusted so much took off with him and we still dont know why we think perhaps she wanted a child of her own
and this was back in wisconsin
yes but we last heard the nanny was heading west thats why we thought colorado made sssssense
weve tried every avenue to find him but weve never tried the milk company
well you just give us a try i think youll find that south park milk is not only the best resource for finding kids but also the best producer of the freshest 2% lowfat milk the world can offer
thank you thank you so much for helping us
this certainly is a friendly town youve all been sssssso wonderful
yes im so grateful i just wanna cry again
no
dude why are you wearing shalaynas panties
i have to wear shalaynas panties lisas were in the wash look can we just get this over with

oh alright here it goes comeere grandpa
aww
oh dude oh
dude whats wrong with you
nothings wrong with me uh-
well im glad thats over with wed better go back to the house now to see how chris is doing
uh mr and mrs thompson as president of the south park milk company i want to apologize personally for printing that falsified picture on our milk cartons
please please its not your fault
ye-yes but here at south park milk we strive for excellence for instance we are now entering the extraction room as you can see we keep it close to the refrigeration room that way we can get the milk to the container as fast as possible thats why some say south park milk tastes like youre suckin it right from the cows tits yourself
amazing
here try a glass of our cold vitamin d and our fresh scones
delicious
oh excuse me a little difficult to drink with our condition
martha and i actually have buttocks where our heads should be
really well and in here we have our missing child resource center
oh my isnt this impressive
yes with the kelrom 4000 mrs garthunk can search a database of over 30 million missing child cases
well start the computer on a data search now when did your son turn up missing
well it was 1982 tommy was only six at the time
alright then computer
workiiing
run a scan of missing children since 1982 check for physical birth defects called tps
tps torsonic polarity syndrome child missing since 1982 workiiing
so you actually havent seen your son in over 20 years
thats right
but then why did you think the picture of kenny was him wouldnt your son be much older now
yes but since he appeared to be at least eight in the photo we assumed someone had seen him since we did
this is the only photo we have of our little tommy
its gonna take quite a while for the computer to do a scan of all missing kids
well why dont we let mrs garthunk do her work and ill take you two out for some good old colorado chili
we dont really like chili it makes us throw up
well hello eric i was really glad you called me very much
