occupied
i called dibs on stall 1 for all recess craig
you cant call dibs on a toilet
son of a bitch oh no no no no i cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time
then dont eat 14 eggo waffles for lunch fatass
all right that does it im sick of this shit and im not gonna be taking it any longer you all pushed me to this
what the hell do you think youre doing
im going to the potty
this is the girls bathroom
alright i need to tell you something wendy im transginger
what
did you notice the bow im not comfortable with the sex i was assigned at birth so im exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice now get out of my way i have to take a shit aaahhh
get out of here
dont give me any more issues than i already have wendy oh wow this is nice in here the girls bathroom is a lot cleaner than the boys
what the hell is that
cartman is using our bathroom
dude this is awesome i shouldve used the girls bathroom a long time ago
hey im gonna tell on you
its okay red i can take a shit here im a dumb chick too
i want to know just what makes you think its okay to go inside the girls bathroom
because im transginger i looked it up that means i can use the girls shitter
you are not transgender eric you dont even know what that means
yeah uh-huh it means i live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy but im really a girl
all right well if you identify yourself as a girl you must find yourself attracted to boys is that right
thats actually not true i can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger im attracted to check the state bylaws
alright listen eric
erica
listen eric you must know why we cant have you in the girls bathroom
all i know is im transginger and you cant make me go to the bathroom with the cisgingers
with the what
cisgender its the politically correct name for people who arent transgender if you identify with the sex you were born with then youre cis
but then cisgender-ed is just normal
saying "normal" is extremely offensive to people who arent in that group trust me you dont want this hot potato just let him use the girls room
but this isnt a hurt and confused child were talking about this is eric cartman
nobody else is gonna know that you better just give him what he wants
sooo eric cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate
actually its more like a royal flush
gerald broflovski
yes
brandon carlile reporter spin magazine i was hoping you could help me make sense of somethin i understand you had a very large party in your back yard last last sunday was it
thats right my son and his friends throw a party for a kid with diabetes
i also understand that a very famous pop artist lorde was the entertainment at that party
oh yeah yeah the kids were pretty excited
well it eh its just a little curious you know why a hugely popular top-20 artist would play such a well no offence but such a humble venue
sorry i dont think i get your-
you understand we deal with a lot of fake stories at spin was just wondering how the boys got someone like lorde to play
from what i understand shes the niece of someones coworker here in town or something
you wouldnt know who
no does it really matter
lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady it would be a shame if someone was having fun at her expense
randy whose are these
aaah i dont know why
why because theres fishnet stockings inside your jeans
in my jeans
randy do you have something to tell me
yeah i do
come on youve been in there for twenty minutes
yeah recess is almost over
theres two more stall in here gals go ahead
not while youre in here
oh my god you guys are so cisginger sorry im different but you can just suck my clit and my balls
eric there are people actually struggling with their gender identity and all youre doing is-
okay okay okay you guys you know what you know what thats what suck my clit and balls
erica i believe we have a solution to this little problem
i dont have a problem principal victoria the cisgenders have the problem
if it is agreeable to you erica we are going to clear out the janitors closet and remodel it into a private bathroom just for you
excuse me are you talking about my own special executive bathroom
would that be agreeable to you
oh my god
that isnt fair
wendy just go with it
yeah just go with it wendy cisginger bitch of course being forced into my own isolated will probably be somewhat traumatic for me i might have to approve certain aspects of this solitary location
yeah sooo im thinking of water feature here you know get the sound of running water yeah kind of zen it out
uh huh well why dont you put the water feature on this side
oh on that side
you know because youve already got ac over here and that leaves this open for some nice big piece of art on this wall
oh i like that thats gonna look nice yeah
yeah listen i dont know if i can keep doing this my wife is starting to suspect something i just had to tell her i like the way fishnets feel
i know your wife means a lot to you randy but you cant leave us hanging youve got the purest shit out there its worth a lot to us
you think youre gonna get a good product when i cant even think
how many times have you said "i think ive lost it" and everything turned out to be okay
every time
every time come on get back to work and see if you get panicked again call me

lorde isnt just a singer shes also a very talented scientist who specializes in fluvial geomorphology

im sorry erica but i spoke with wendyl this morning and shes not comfortable-
wendyl fucking wendyl grow up wendy
youll just have to share eric why cant you understand that
because i dont want a chick watching me go poo
i thought you were a chick
no i identify as a chick but im still a boy you cant make me share a bathroom with a girl that identifies herself as a fucking dude that is my waterfall and those are my christmas lights
dude you need to put a tighter leash on your dog
what
do you know your girlfriends going around tellin everyone that youre gay oh yeah shes got the whole school believin that shes attracted to girls but shes dating you so what does that make you stan a girl stan-ans a gir-rl youd better curb your dog stan youd better curb your dog before people start ripping on you
shelly thats enough time on your phone
leave me alone dad stop nagging me all the time
you know were all cutting down on phone time
dont limit me you dont even understand me
yeah i dont understand you at all a lot you know
uh hey dad i need to talk to you
oh really a-about about what
dad is it possible for someone to be one way on the outside but totally different on the inside i mean can someone identify as one sex but be something else but still have it be nothing about sex
yes yes stan i am lorde
what
it started off so simple theres a guy at work hanson he would use the bathroom and just blow the thing up you know not only that but he was in there all the time i finally got fed up and pretended to be a woman i called myself lorde have you ever been in a womans bathroom stan its all clean and theres enough stalls for everyone it was so freeing i started singing while i was in there and then i- started writing things down
well you said you knew a guy at work who was lordes uncle
yah thats my cover
the chick that wrote the theme song to the new hunger games is you
yeah the record company messed it all up it was supposed to go "hunger games yah yah yah yah yah yah hunger games" but they just- do what they want with my songs
wha-wait lorde sounds like a girl
autotune wanna see how i do it i come up with all my best stuff in the bathroom at work i use this program to import the recordings i make on my phone "yeah yeah feeling good on a wednesday sparklinnnnn thoughts givin me the hope to go ohhhn" "oh whoa what i need now is a little bit of shelter"
dad lordes music is actually really good
thanks but it gets even better when i add the drum loops then with the computer i can actually quantize everything backup instruments and then finally i use the autotune "sparklin thoughts feelin good on a wednesday givin me the hope givin givin me the hope to go ohhhn what i need is a little bit of shelter" stan
hey everything okay stan
i dont know where i belong
just hold it thats what i do now
hey what the fuck dude god fucking damn it
why dont we just have everyone use the transgender bathroom
stanley do you have a reason for not using the boys bathroom
i i just two people close to me are having gender identity issues and im im confused
hes cisginger hes so cis he wears a jockstrap to bed at night
you wanted to see me boss
yes please have a seat lorde
hi carol
lorde
lorde were all big fans of your music and we think the world of you for staying and working here even after your music career took off
well my music and fluvial geomorphology are intertwined
amazing yeah uh lorde for some time now the females at this office have been pressuring me to uh find your own space to go to the bathroom everyone loves you but we thought it would be great if you had your very own executive bathroom
i like the womens bathroom i feel safe there being able to use that bathroom is critical to my identity to my music
my girls are big fans of your music lorde but the women here arent comfortable sharing a bathroom with
with what with what
you are watching e entertainment news thats how low youve sunk
its been several days and still theres no sign of the pop singer lorde the singer went dark on twitter claiming severe depression and stating "i realize now that i make people uncomfortable i need to give this up and go back to just being the old me" spin magazine is claiming they know the reason for the sudden exit and will be releasing a tell-all article about the troubled artist next week
oh here he comes everyone its the cisginger think you can harass transgingers and use their bathroom
yeah whats the big idea harassing erica stan
at this school it doesnt matter if youre trans or youre cis right guys what we have a problem with are cisgingers who are intolerant you know what we call those cissies
yeah stans a big old fat cissy
awe come on lay off him guys
oh what are you a cissy too clyde
no no just he is
you just gonna drink beer alone all day
its okay its gluten free
all right do you know why young people like lorde so much its because shes something different kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it lorde represents something in all of us the truth that wants to be heard if i could talk to lorde right now you know what id tell her id tell her not to let people change who she is id tell her that if people are making fun of her its probably because they lost touch with being human id tell her to keep on doing what she does because when someones not allowed to express who they are inside then we all lose thats what i would say to lorde
feelin good on a wednesdaythe image of me that you seeis distorted twisted broken fractured isolated miles out to seai dont want a separate placei need to feel safe not thrown away away awayand i will push (push)to tear down the walls (push push)of this box you put me in (push push)because you dont understand(push ow hot push ow ow hot) you pushto find a label that fits meim feelin good on a wednesdaywith sparklin thoughtshelp me unload the car yah yah yahand so i pushto close the doorof the stall youve made for meto keep me awayand now we pushpush to stand togetherbecause i am lorde (yah yah yah)yah yah yah i am lordei am lorde yah yah yahyah yah yah i am lordeyah yah yahyah yah yah i am lordeyah yah yah
and so it is with great pride that i can announce the student body has elected to get rid of the transgender bathroom and give any fellow student the right to use the bathroom they feel most comfortable in
i dont wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it its gonna be all crowded
anyone who has a problem sharing a bathroom with people who might be transgender will have to use the special designated bathroom designed to keep them away from the normal people who dont care
hey where do you think youre going
to the bathroom
oh no you dont youve gotta use the cissy bathroom well go on cissy
wow this is is pretty nice feelin good on a mondaygot my space all the freedom i needyah yah yahby myself yah yah yah
