whats going on here
weve been following your story since we first saw it on the news dont worry - youre with friends now dale here used the n-word in a racial joke at work scott used the plural n-word to refer to a group of gardeners who broke his fence
they were mexicans i was being ironic
were all just like you
no no no im sorry but im not like you i just said the n-word by mistake to win money
i made a mistake too i was trying to be funny i got frustrated and thought i would get some shock laughs im just not that good of a comedian if you want to know the real truth
you said the n-word to a black mans face thats way worse than what i did
you really think that matters you really think all those people out there see a difference oh they might say your racial slur was more accidental they might even laugh about it but at the end of the day all you are to them is just another damn "ni**er" guy oh you dont like that do ya
no
randy we want you to join us we have a plan to make this all go away once and for all
now look token ive done everything i can to make this right you have no reason to still be mad
i have every reason to be mad you just dont get it
im not responsible for what my dad did
no but you cant just pretend it never happened either
what the hell do you want from me
nothing
then stop being mad
no
fellas fellas come quick cartmans gonna fight the midget
cmon now eric come on now
dude are you sure you wanna do this apparently this guy has a black belt in karate
its a midget dude
students i am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point
hahaha no- no dude it cant talk that isnt fair ill laugh too much
senators i know it is not normally considered "american" to ban words but there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal im talking of course about the term "ni**er guy"
"ni**er guy"
two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together form a verbal missile of hate
yeah thats right
oh sure some people just use the term in jest - tell a ni**er guy joke or two thinking its no big deal - but they dont realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence
goddamn ni**er guys tryin to be all political-like now
senators ive learned to admit that im capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while can anybody say they never do how long will it be before you are all called "ni**er guys"
uhhh hold on a second are you suggesting that "ni**er guy" could become a slur that refers to all white people
im certainly not a ni**er guy ive never thought a racist thought
aw come on youre the biggest ni**er guy in washington
mr marsh we see now the importance of your bill all those in favor to ban the term "ni**er guy"
aye
opposed
nay
the motion is passed
we did it
for the first time in american history a word has been officially banned from use
from now on if a person uses the word "ni**er" it must be at least seven words away from the word "guy"
tom it appears that the ni**er guy epidemic is ove- oh dammit i said it didnt i
aaaa ow ow okay okay you win
say "uncle"
ung-cle
hahaha now say "carol anne dont go into the light"
carol anne dont go into the light
haaha hahahahahaha oh man that is hysterical oh
there now you all see that i am not limited by my size i have proven my point my work here is done
what was his point
i have no idea
dude i dont get it
i dont get it either
wait a minute thats it i dont get it
huh
dont you see kyle i dont get it token i get it now i dont get it ive been trying to say that i understand how you feel but ill never understand ill never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the n word i dont get it
now you get it stan
yeah i totally dont get it
thanks dude
