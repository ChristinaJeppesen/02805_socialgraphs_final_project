perhaps this document will make the reasons for war obvious to all good luck young messenger now make haste
okay so thomas jefferson wrote the declaration of independence then the continental congress-
no war no war no war
oh jesus
uh boys would you mind clearing the living room we have to practice our big war protest song
dad we have to study mr garrison is making us do a presentation on what the founding fathers would say about the war
hey thats a terrific idea
yeah we could have the boys do their presentation as part of our peace rally on saturday
oh no nononono
support our troops support our troops support our troops
see i told you they had your son
kenny what are you doing over here with all these un-american traitors
(im doing my homework)
the boys are going to give a presentation at our rally about how the founding fathers would agree with our right to protest
actually we hadnt really come to a decision-
look my son is a patriot and loves his country come on kenny
(but dad i-)
now
yeah
support our troops support our troops support our troops support our troops
kenny no- ohhh awww awww now we lost two in our study group
god damnit
can you believe those hick sons of bitches manipulating those kids to be on their side
disgraceful stan and kyle its up to you to show all those war-mongerers that the founding fathers agree with us
yeah thats right
come on guys
get back to work
do you think kids in every town have to deal with this crap
enter young messenger i am john hancock president of the congress
wow
mr john adams
aye
will you do the honors of reading the document to congress please
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one penis to rise up- -we mutually pledge to each other our lives our fortunes and our sacred honorps - every thursday should be free ice cream day
excuse me but does this declaration actually suggest that we should go to go war with england
we have no choice mr dickinson
all right everyone thank you all for comin out to protest the war mkay
dont kid yourselves these people have come out to support our troops right
and now randy marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war
oh no you dont were doing our pro-war song first
yeah the last thing these people want is a bleedin-heart rock protest song
people i told you you have to share the stage
nobody wants to here another pro-war country song
well excuse me if im a little bit country
well im a little bit rock-n-roll-ah
im a little for supportin our troops
and im a little for bringin em home
i believe freedom isnt free
no but war shouldnt be our goal
we must defend our country
if it means war then we say no
yeehaw
did you forget them towers in new yorkdid you forget how it made you feelto see them towers come downwere you like me did you think it werent real
i like to rock but i dont wanna rock iraqthe only kind of rockin america should do is the kind that we can all dance to yeah
we got gps icbms and good old-fashioned leadwere gonna show saddam what america means that son of a bitchll be dead
why are we fightin this wartheres a man in the office we didnt vote forthey didnt give me a choicewar is not my voice yeaaaaahhhh
we must go to war
but what about the violence the lives lost if we found a country it should be founded on peace and diplomacy
england will only understand one thing force
i must state again for the record that south carolina north carolina pennsylvania maryland and georgia are against war
yeah because you dont care about the fate of the colonies like we do youre all unpatriotic and if you dont like the colonies then you can get out
dont you call us unpatriotic were protesting this war because we care so deeply for the fate of our colonies you are all unpatriotic for leading the colonies into a war that half of them dont want
whoa how very very relevant
tom im standing in the town square where the war rally has been going on for an incredible eighty-seven hours the crowd still appears to be split right down the middle - half of them support country music and the other half rock-n-roll lets listen in
and now wed like to bring out a couple of very special south park students who did a report on what the founding fathers would have to say about the war
booooo
for you people who still think war is the answer perhaps you can listen to the voices of the children
uh we didnt do it
what
we didnt do our homework
boys you were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the founding fathers
well first we lost one study partner when cartman put himself in the hospital and then they took kenny away and then kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for daylight savings and we couldnt find anything in the history books about iraq and then-
thats because the founding fathers would have supported the war
the founding fathers would have protested like us
support
protest
country
rock-n-roll
rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble
we cannot found a country based on war
we cannot found a country that is afraid to fight
rabble
rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble oh my its benjamin franklin its benjamin franklin its benjamin franklin
oh its benjamin franklin its benjamin franklin its benjamin franklin
mr franklin where do you stand on the war issue
i believe that if we are to form a new country we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world however we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world so what if we form a country that appears to want both
yes yes of course we go to war and protest going to war at the same time
right if the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish then some will support the war and some will protest it
and that means that as a nation we could go to war with whomever we wished but at the same time act like we didnt want to if we allow the people to protest what the government does then the country will be forever blameless
its like having your cake and eating it too
think of it an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another
and we will call that country the united states of america
wow i get it now i get it whoa here it goes i wish i could go back to my time to my time to to my time
wow
everyone stop please
the-the child the child from the hospital
if you all dont mind i would like to do my report now i know what the founding fathers would say
he does
he does
i learned somethin today this country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen and they knew one thing that a truly great country can go to war and at the same time act like it doesnt want to
you people who are for the war you need the protesters because they make the country look like its made of sane caring individuals and you people who are anti-war you need these flag-wavers because if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters wed get taken down in a second thats why the founding fathers decided we should have both its called "having your cake and eating it too"
hes right the strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another
yeah but if it werent for all you guys protesting why everyone around the world would hate the american people instead of just the president
and if it werent for you people flexing your arms america could easily get taken over by terrorists or or china
i guess we owe you an apology
eh-ah i guess we owe you one
awww
cartman cartman saved the day
cant be
the founding fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want as long as we agree that america kicks ass
hey im a little bit country
and im a little bit rock-n-roll-ah
ill be the muscle of america
and me ill be the caring soul
and when you put us together you get a nation with one goalto thrive and prosper with a little country and rock and roll
come on up here everybody
were a little bit country and were a little bit rock-n-roll
we can be a nation that believes in war
and still tells the world that we dont
let the flag for hypocrisy fly high from every polecuz were a little bit country and were a little bit rock-n-roll
well goodnight everybody it sure has been great bringing you a hundred episodes
we want to thank our guests the pro-war people and the anti-war people
what the hell are they doing now
i-i dont know
for the war against the war who cares one hundred episodes
i hate this town i-i really really do
