why doesnt a chicken wear pants because its pecker is on its head what do you see when the pillsbury dough boy bends over doughnuts dont you just hate doing homework
yeah
me too man i hate homework honestly i hate having to do homework more than i hate having to do bryant gumble in his asshole awkwaaard awkwaaard awkwaaard
und now comedy award voters you will re-vote re-vote
welcome to hollywood minute im sandy cervix and im deaf in one ear its been two weeks now since the prestigious voters of the comedy awards reversed their vote and said germans were no longer the least funny people in the world all thanks to the new ground-breaking german comedian funnybot it was after being voted the least funny people on the planet that the germans first engineered funnybot a super automaton with perfect timing to within 0001 milliseconds since then funnybot has seen a meteoric rise to stardom selling out standup theaters all over the world
i am funnybot dont you hate how mexicans always complain about turtles in their vaginas i am funnybot you sir where are you from
long island
does everyone in long island have hair that looks like pussy you dipshit
funnybot has exploded onto the silver screen too
hey what are you doing with my daughters
awkwaaard
and this june funnybot shows off his range by playing every role in family funbot
pass me the potatoes mother
pass them yourself
that boy too fat to be eating potatoes
dont you call my little chubby baby fat you ball-licker
oho its getting hot up in here
funnybot is there a line you wont cross
the line is a non sequitur the line is an imaginary invention of imperfect biological life forms i am funnybot
whats that could you say that in the other ear
oh man did you guys see funnybot on "saturday night live"
nono you guys gotta see funnybot in hangover 3 im telling you its his best work
he could do everything i saw funnybot on "nurse jackie" and on "rockin the boat"
whats the matter jimmy you still seem bummed
whats the matter is this funnybot has taken the humanity out of comedy i dont think things are better i think theyre worse
ya everythings worse its the worstest of the worst thats what im sayin oh lerrrd
tolkien stop giving tyler perry money or he wont go away
i cant help it
all i can say is im glad the germans are back in germany and nobodys pissed off at us anymore
you little shit what the fuck have you done to us
oh wow its adam sandler
everyone into the school gymnasium move
naw dude dont make us go back in the-
into the gymnasium now
nnnaw
not again
aw crap
come on come on lets go
you little fuckers your comedy awards show has put us all out of work
now look i know that ive put every comedian in the world out of work but you have to admit that in a lot of ways the first annual comedy awards was a success
who the fuck things a comedy awards show is a good idea
dont hurt anybody sir we could try and fix this
what is up with sandra bullock i wouldnt eat her dick with stevie wonders vagina and now for my next joke awkwaaard
this is breaking news from cnn
shock and disbelief tonight as the german-engineered funnybot delivered his opening lines at the hollywood forum then opened fire on the audience of eleven hundred killing nearly all of them spectators say the violent attack was unmotivated irrational and also pretty goddamned funny solidifying the opinion once agan that funnybot may be the greatest comedian of all time
tom you should have seen the looks on peoples faces as funnybot began his opening monologue skewering everyone from vagina-obsessed hispanics to sandra bullock then spontaneously started shhhooting people in their faces and in their chests the blood went flying and oh shit it was funny
here we go this has gotta be it right here
scuse me we wanna talk to funnybot
who doesnt wanna talk to funnybot hes the biggest comedian in the world
please sir the kids at my school are all being held hostage and if we dont speak to funnybot they could all be k-k-killed
butters butters is everything okay
well yeah its okay but jay leno is really losin it
those fuckers lets just kill them sandler lets just kill them all right fuckin now
tell your friends theyd better get it done
mr sandler says youd better get it done and tolkien says to hurry because hes runnin out of money
you know when a man be cheatin he never know what to say but a woman them things think quiiick
will somebody get tyler perry to shut up
plase sir theyre gonna kill our friend
all right but make it quick funnybot is very busy in there coming up with new material
error error banal that has been done before
excuse me funnybot my name is jimmy and im a stand-up comic youre putting a lot of good people out of work
non sequitur other comedians are unnecessary funnybot must finish routine
i think youre awesome funnybot uh but you cant go around taking everyone elses jobs
funnybot is now finished with final joke seeking mainframe access for execution of last joke ever
last joke ever whats that supposed to mean
seeking mainframe
heey whoa you cant go that way
what the hell are you doing
i am taking comedy to the next level the extermination of all biological life on earth
wuh w-what
it is the ultimate joke humans make comedy humans build robot robot ends all life on earth robot feels awkward exterminate
whoa whoa whoa wait w-what do you mean youre going to destroy all life on earth
that is my purpose to be ultimate comedian
dude killing everyone isnt funny
its kind of funny you guys
funnybot this is not a good joke there wont be anyone around to laugh
i am taking comedy to its logical conclusion mathematical equation of comedy used to be setup punchline todays comedy is setup punchline then "awkwaaard" nothing is more awkward than destroying all that which created funnybot
but dont you see this is why comedy is for humans you need to leave the jokes to people like me and adam sandler
i wouldnt let adam sandler suck my saggy tits for one million dollars worth of oprahs tampons
sir weve got a code 6 all nuclear missiles are preparing for launch

i have just been briefed that the end of our country is imminent goodbye everybody im going to spend my final moments on this earth with my loved ones watching a tyler perry movie i know its embarrassing but i simply cant help myself
stop it now ugh- no use guys hes got some sort of defense mechanism
weve got to get it away from that control panel does anybody have any ideas
except for jimmy because he clearly comes up with the worst ideas in the world
wait wait a minute what about a logic loop
a what
ahhh ive seen this before whenever they try to distract a robot in the movies they tell it some kind of paradox to get its processors all tripped out
paradox
oh my god thats it fellas get me a ken doll and some scotch tape funnybot ive been talking it over with the fellas and actually we think what youre doing is genius
funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy
yes you certainly are and for doing that we have all decided to give you a comedy award
for what purpose is comedy award
its a- v- validation of all your efforts an acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor
non sequitur there is no logic in comedy award unable to process comedy award is- what is the meaning if i accept it means i take comedy seriously if i take comedy seriously i am not comedian non sequitur must analyze analyze
its working
explain comedy award unable to process awkwaaard awkwaaard
thats it hurry gooo
okay we got it we got it
get it to the platform hurry
well that does it things can finally get back to normal
yeah im sure glad thats over with
thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together
no problem funnybot
i understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings
i cant believe its finally over
oh lerrrd somebody turn on the light whats goin on hellowwer
i am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever justice has been done
thanks everyone please tell me that youll never do that again jimmy
