okay children lets all take our seats as you all know thanksgiving is only two weeks away and so the school has arranged for a lecture from a real live native american
oh neato huh fellas
hello boys and girls my name is david running horse sawitsky and i am one sixteenth cherokee indian
does that mean we only have to pay one sixteenth attention to you
thereve been a lot of "stories" about the first thanksgiving and unfortunately they are mostly geared towards making the pilgrims look good and my people being degraded as usual was thanksgiving about turkey and peace or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race
thanksgiving is about murder
this is bullcrap a guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on thanksgiving
well it is kinda true you know thanksgiving is fun and all but the native americans got pretty screwed over
yeah and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them
hey fatass instead of laying in bed eating why dont you come and help
jesus kyle you are really being crampy today
we all have to do this report together dude
you guys we are wasting time if we have to write a report on thanksgiving lets just go downstairs and watch tv
how is that gonna help
dumbass its november the history channel is probably playing thanksgiving specials back to back we can learn everything we need
youre watching the history channel where the truth is history
a lot has been written about the first thanksgiving between pilgrims and native americans but what really happened at that first historic dinner
dude see i told you who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when weve got history channel
we know the first thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621 but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the pilgrims and native americans may have been visited by aliens
in every journal entry we researched from those early pilgrims not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there
and what about the food does the appearance of stuffing at the first thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology
uh-huh
what this isnt history
dude it is called history channel
(yeah)
and if we look in all the journals and aall the history books there is no reference to stuffing before 1621 so where did it come from did it come from space we just dont know
did ancient aliens shape the first thanksgiving is it mere coincidence that cape cod when viewed from space looks like an alien life form what exactly did the pilgrims experience how exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every november
what
kyle why are you being so grumpy are you on your period again
were not basing research for our report on this crap
okay lets take a vote who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report
dude
okay and who wants to take a little pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down kyle
alright fine lets just get this stupid report over with
yes a report from where does congress know about this yet try to keep it contained and get the helicopters ready ill be there as soon as i can
darling
they found something this could be it
did you guys know that when you stop menstruating its called menopause
what
yeah god takes your period away and apparently it makes you really irritable i was thinking maybe thats why kyles been so grouchy lately cause hes goin through menopause
dude shut your fuckin mouth
see what i mean you guys
is that them
thats them
you boys have been very busy we need to know everything that you know
bout what
have you been contacted by alien life forms
did you come across some kind of ship or something
dude look we we just saw all this stuff on history channel
we are the history channel for years weve been collecting information on thanksgiving were getting close to the truth and now you boys have exactly the same information it cant be coincidence
we saw it on your channel
what exactly did you seez
that stuffing was never heard of before 1621 so it might be alien technology
my god would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview
alright butters thats enough mtv for one day you need to watch something that stimulates your brain im putting on history channel
okay dad
youre watching the history channel the only network dedicated to history coming up next its monster quest larrh followed by hairy bikers errh but now back to part 3 of ancient aliens at thanksgiving
it has become a widely accepted fact that thanksgiving was a meal attended by pilgrims native americans and alien beings
stuffing wasnt mentioned anywhere until 1621 and it might have been alien technology
and while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether could it be that pilgrims were actually aliens themselves
of course you cant prove there were no aliens at the first thanksgiving just like you cant "prove" that the pilgrims themselves werent alien can you prove that here draw that thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand maybe that symbol matches galaxies in space or something ooooooooooooo
could it be that the pilgrims weve read about all these years actually came from another planet history experts like kyle broflovski say "yes"
you might as well just say pilgrims and indians were all aliens who came here and made some kind of intergalactic treaty
wow check it out dude were on tv
how can they make a show out of this i wasnt even agreeing with them
what are you doing
uh oh
the first thanksgiving was a space treaty native americans are aliens
i was just explaining how a negative argument doesnt make a po-
havent my people been through enough goddamn you
ack dude
the white man is gonna pay for his lies
look at this sir an aerial photograph of cape cod where the pilgrims landed in 1620 five pilgrim settlements with plymouth rock here the same symbols appear everywhere in history
the symbology lines up to mirrored points in space if kyle broflovski is right then plymouth rock is some kind of wormhole
pilgrims and indians were the aliens how did we not think of it
sometimes it takes the innocence of a child to make us see the most simple things
true dat
true dat
get all those tourists out of here we need this place secured
alight people lets clear out we need you all to disperse this area is under quarantine
give me a piece of chalk huh nothing
guess kyle broflovski was wrong
well at least we werent outsmarted by a nine-year-old kid we shouldve known pilgrims couldnt be from space
here you can see it right there an object clearly fell from the sky and struck the earth
what is it
its a pilgrim sir
so then professor broflovski was right after all
not long ago it was an accepted fact that civilizations on earth shared the universe with beings from other planets these alien beings visited our world and once even settled it from deep within the galaxy canis major and a distant planet called plymouth
fellow pilgrims the great captain hath gone missing and thine enemies have attacked our stuffing mines we must prepare for war with the indians
now it is our time we shall attack plymouth and we will take all their stuffing
non mom did you already get stuffing for thanksgiving dinner
what hon
tell me youve already got everything we need for thanksgiving
uhoh thanksgivings still a couple of weeks away sweetie i havent gone shoppies yet
oh no oh no
what is it hon
clyde donovan said that he saw on the news theres gonna be a massive stuffing shortage get your coat on mom weve gotta go to the store
you guys have stuffing
stuffing sure aisle 17
oh were not too late mother come hey where is it
its right there right on the uh wait that cant be right hey hey chet what happened to all the stuffing
what are you talking about
we got more in the back right
i just did inventory in the back it it was all put out here
you mean its two weeks until thanksgiving and were completely out of stuffing
oh no
no
no
noooo
you dare come to plymouth ambassador after attacking our stuffing mines
the stuffing mines were never yours
wihtout control of the mines we cannot supply stuffing to the mortals ambassador this will be war
you are in no position to declare war your lead commander is nowhere to be found
and how knoweth you that
word travels fast in our sector
i do not give free bowls of stuffing what sayest you we will take back control of the stuffing mines
then the thanksgiving treaty will be off
and i pray to stuffing that you are wrong where are you miles standish
and furthermore everything kyle broflovski said about native americans being from outer space was untrue native americans were brutalized and david sawitzkys ancestors deserve an apology it was wrong to mix aliens and real history
i dont know dude have you seen that stuff about the pyramids and the link to mars
dude theres a guy with a gun here
im just saying theres lots of symbols and signs out there that show aliens and history are pretty linked
(yeah thats true)
would you guys stop
just keep writing your apology
how now indian why hast thy race sent me here to earth
huh ack
dude
you indians took me to thy planet and then cast me here why
(go dude)
yeah go on dude
(woohoo)
hast thy race attacked our stuffing mines and sent me here to die tell me indian
i i uh im only one sixteenth
hold your lying tongue this shall prove if thou art indian or not ah he was not
i didnt think so
i have been told of your expertise kyle of devry institute i need your wisdom to get back to my planet
into the wheeled chariot that strucketh me we must make haste to cape cod
whos this
this is natalie
hi guys
alright sir we got some more information on the pilgrim who crashed to earth thirty seconds after impact the pilgrim was hit by a truck and then put into the back seat
who did the truck belong to
we believe it belonged to natalie portman sir
the actress that doesnt make sense
it gets worse all over the country people are reporting a shortage of stuffing we dont think its coincidence
youre telling me that somehow during a stuffing shortage this "pilgrim" dropped down from space and got into a truck driven by natalie portman
look if anyone knows about stuffing its natalie portman
we have to find professor broflovski he was right about all of this hell know what to do
we shall make camp here for the night on the morrow perhaps we can reach cape cod and thanksgiving may yet be saved what is wrong with kyle of devry institute
aw i think hes just kind of pissed off he was wrong about the whole ancient alien thing
he seems almost like a puritan lady whose period hath stopped i fear kyle that you still do not know whose side to be on
no ah i dont
it must have been very difficult for you being the one on your planet with his wild theories that pilgrims and indians were not of this world
i actually only just said that sarcastically
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha then you are only just a remarkably gifted child here let me show you your planet is one of the five plymouth indi colthenheim and this planet over here nobody really cares about the five are connected by a series of wormholes my people came to your world and so did our enemies but we made a treaty and for 300 years our people have not fought but now the treaty is over
but i always read that native americans were here and that pilgrims and other settlers kind of took their lands from them
you cant believe what everyone tells you kyle you have to open your eyes soon your wisdom will open the wormhole back to plymouth and the stuffing mines can again be ours for he who controls the stuffing controls the universe
hold it right there
we found professor broflovski he is with the pilgrim
stay back all of you for i will get to cape cod and cannot be stopped come boys let us fight to the death
wait stop stop please mr standish we are all on the same side here we know why theres a stuffing shortage weve been trying to get the wormhole open
i trust none but them indians hath betrayed us i must return to plymouth so my king can know the truth
please were the history channel we care as much about the truth as you do
then get us to cape cod as soon as possible
my lord my lord the battle is lost we have tried to stop the indians on their home planet but yea they are too strong
then our last chance for survival is gone
im sorry my lord all pilgrim forces sent to the indians planet have been wiped out
and so soon the indians will be here sound the corn horn we must abandon plymouth
the stuffing mines are ours
earth is connected to plymouth by this wormhole here once i get back i will assemble my people to attack indi and gain control of the stuffing mines if all goes as planned you will all have stuffing in time for thanksgiving
but mr standish im afraid its not that simple we tried to get the wormhole open with this symbol and it didnt work
ah ha ha ha of course not you have the correct symbol but you are missing the keeper of the portal
the keeper of the of course natalie portman
we were wondering what she had to do with all this natalie portman controls the wormhole
our window of opportunity is closing sir the wormhole has to be opened now
alright ms portman we need you to open your wormhole
mmmmmmmmmm no
please ms portman youve got to open your wormhole right now
mmmmmmm uh uh
curses and cranberries i must get to plymouth now do as they say
mmmmmmmmmm no
there has to be a way to get the portal open wheres our expert what do we do professor broflovski
im not a professor
the history channel said you were
you are the fucking history channel
please kyle of devry institute there is no more time for squabbles the universe is at stake
you knew everything else you somehow knew about all of this you knew it here you must know how to get natalie portman to open her wormhole
so do you uh do you have any brothers or sisters natalie
i had a lot of really close friends growing up but not any brothers and sisters i was an only child
wow awesome um
i have dual citizenship in the united states and israel oh thanks
um so so dual citizenship wow uh you know that i i never knew anyone that had that
well i went to harvard while i was acting i got a ba but i did classes at the university of jerusalem too
cool cool you wanna order some dessert
thanks that was a lot of fun
yeah it was cool thanks um so is there any way youd
what
you know could youuu
what
would you please just open your wormhole
oh mmmm no
errh
mmmmmmmmmm okay
yes
alright lets go folks
just for a sec though
thank you kyle of devry institute now the indians can be stopped and thanksgiving will be saved
yeeah youre welcome im sorry i doubted you and guys im im sorry i acted like a know-it-all
its cool dude we understand
i guess we should all realize that history and alien technology really do go hand in hand
now make way children for i have a war to fight for stuffing
take all their stuffing
the treaty ends now
with the wormhole once again open miles standish was finally able to command a pilgrim army
now attack their left flank good theyre retreating hit them with the anti-indian device
the pilgrims fought off the indians making stuffing once again available on all our thanksgiving tables
yea stuffing mines yea
and now you know the true story behind thanksgiving
wow theres a lot about thanksgiving i never knew before
yeah history channel rules
but was the first thanksgiving really just about pilgrims and indians from space or was there something more shocking new evidence suggests that the first thanksgiving might also have been haunted
there is certainly no evidence that the first thanksgiving dinner was not haunted
the pilgrims welcomed the indians but did they also unknowingly welcome spirits from beyond the grave
ohhh
oh come on
