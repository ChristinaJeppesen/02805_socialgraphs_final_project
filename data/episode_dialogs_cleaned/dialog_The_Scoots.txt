hey wait thats what were doing
what
hold on you guys are using e-scooters on halloween too
oh you jerks found out the girls are all trick or treating on e-scooters and you stole our idea
okay hold on this is bullcrap
it was the day before halloween all of our parents were gathered together to try and stop a nightmare from coming true
all right everyone quiet please we have a community crisis on our hands and its my job to keep you informed as you know theres been a rise in the use of e-scooters in our town officer brown is head of crisis control officer
we have inside information that kids everywhere are going to be using e-scooters for tricks or treats now with these things kids and teens can cover a lot of ground in very little time they can hit more houses than ever before because of the scooters we also expect that people from all the neighboring counties will commute for tricks or treats in our town because of all of this we believe each household needs to be prepared with at least $6000 worth of candy
$6000
well thats ridiculous we we cant all buy that much candy lets just get rid of those scooters
yeah thats right lets do it
you cant get rid of them i tried you all just sat there while those things piled up on our sidewalks you all rode em around mkay i saw you you could have used your cars but you just had to scoot and now tricks or treats is here well ill tell you one thing im not gonna let my house get egged this year for not havin enough candy so what are we gonna do
