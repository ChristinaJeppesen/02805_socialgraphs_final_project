towelie
aha mmm yes yes i see well thats quite a fascinating story you being engineered as a towel with a computer chip that determines dryness
yep and its all true
chapters 4 through 8 however seem to all be about doritos brand corn chips
i guess i could edit those chapters down some
dont bother im sorry to tell you this sir but nobodys ever going to publish your memoirs
huh why not
well just the small trivial fact that people arent interested in autobiographies of towels
wull yeah but maybe people will read my memoirs and like apply its lessons to their own lives
no they wont because theyre people and youre a towel
youre a towel
no im a big book publisher whos not the least bit interested in your stony memoirs youre a towel
now what am i gonna do i gotta pay rent and i just wasted three weeks writin my memoirs its time for me to stop bein so irresponsible ive gotta shape up focus an come up with real solutions to my problems id better get a little high oh maybe i shouldnt
but you have to think of somethin fast an gettin high makes you smart
all right ill just use my special gettin-high powers one more time hey hey wait a minute of course thats it why didnt i think of it before
all my life ive been a pretty irresponsible towel person i thought i was somehow stronger and more immune than other towels people this is a really good idea
ogh oh my god uh i could not believe a human being has led this kind of life mr
mctowelie steven mctowelie
its heartbreaking passages like this one "i am a person who often gets hung out to dry by all those around me" i know this company would be honored to publish this book i just have one small question first youre not a towel are you
no if i was a towel why would i be wearin this hat an this fake mustache
right im sorry well steveen if its all right with you im gonna to get our agents and lawyers on the phone right now were in business sir
all right
thank you so much once in a while i come across a book that is sooo honest and sooo moving that it changes my life "a million little fibers" is the true story about a man who was born in a laboratory please welcome author stevem mctowelie steven when i read your book i thought to myself "how can a human being go through all this and still turn out okay"
well i guess im just an extra-special tow- person
you talk in your book how you would sometimes have to spend days hung up on a rack what would that do to you emotionally you have been through so much and i think that people all over america could benefit
oh god there she goes again babblin about peoples lives and carryin on she hasnt paid any attention to me in years
a life that kept getting up whenever it was down
nobody knows what its like to be oprahs minge all she does is work never gives her ol minge a nice rub now and again a minge needs attention at least a scratch once in a while
well steven your book hasnt sold a lot of copies yet but i have some pretty exciting news for you
