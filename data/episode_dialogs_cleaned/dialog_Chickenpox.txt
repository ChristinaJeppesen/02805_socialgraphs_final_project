its a good thing we got her to the hospital in time
but whats wrong with her
its chickenpox there seems to be a small epidemic going around your daughter never had the chickenpox as a little child i take it
no no shes been perfectly healthy
well thats the problem you see chickenpox is a pretty normal thing for young children but as you get older it becomes a more and more ferocious disease
shelly look whos come to visit you your little brother stan
oh whoo-peee
you know most people dont realize that chickenpox is actually a form of herpes
dude youve got herpes on your face
shut up brat
will my daughter be okay
shell be fine
stop it
we just want to be cautious and monitor her here
ow
come on stanley give your sister a kiss and then we have to go
and then the doctor said that its much worse as you get older my daughter is in pretty bad shape now but if she were in her twenties she could die
my god i never knew chickenpox was such a dangerous illness
i guess its much better to get it when youre young
so tell me if im crazy but i started thinking that we should intentionally have our boys play with a child who has the chickenpox let them get it now while theyre young
thats not crazy at all sharon mothers do it all the time
oh yes when i was a child my mother had me go over to a little girls house who had the chickenpox just so i would get it
so its not such a crazy idea after all
noo no and im pretty sure that strange little boy kenny has the chickenpox right now
are you guys having a meeting or something
how would you boys like to have a little slumber party at your friend kennys house tonight
no way dude kennys familys poor they live in the ghetto
yeah lets just have a slumber party here

who stuart yeah yeah i guess we were
well how come kennys family eats frozen waffles for dinner and has rats on the floor and we have a big house and lots of food

but why if theyre hungry and poor why dont we just always give them half of our food
ha ha ha ha ha ooh-ho boy have you got a lot to learn sit down son
you see kyle we humans work as a society and in order for a society to thrive we need gods and clods
gods and clods
yes you see i spent a lot of time going to law school and i was able to go because i have a slightly higher intellect than others but i still need people to pump my gas and make my french fries and fix my laundry machine when it breaks down

oh wow you did wow you guys suck

no bubbeleh you play with kenny some more
but weve been playing for eight hours we cant think of anything else to do
ive got a great game for you its called "ookie mouth"
whats "ookie mouth"
first you let kenny spit in your mouth then you try to swallow his spit and say "ookie mouth" at the same time
sick dude
no no bubbe its loads of fun try it
that ought to take care of it
you want some more hot water
oh no thank you its terrific though its-- you dont have any tea bags or coffee grounds to go in the hot water do you

try again bubbe
argh
you know your husband and mine used to work together as teenagers
oh they wuz best friends you couldnt separate em
really i met gerald in college so i didnt know what happened to them
oh they jus grew apart i guess i think stuarts a little jealous that your husband got out of makin pizzas and went on to make somethin of hisself
well thats too bad im sure your husbands a fine man
oh hell no hes a nugget o deer turd
but if they were such good friends it seems silly that they dont even talk anymore lets get them together
uh-i dont know
well just arrange a little fishing trip for them or something
i cant say "ookie mouth" and have kenny spit down my throat at the same time its impossible
practice makes perfect bubbe
