dads a good shopper all right
butters maybe you could secretly follow your dad and see what hes getting me
you mean spy on him uh but aint that kind of like fibbin
no its a little different you remember when the nice policeman gave you a badge and made you an honorary inspector

why i think inspector butters could find out what daddyd getting mommy without him ever knowing what do you say
inspector butters in on the case maam
everyone know its butters
uh thats me
hm dads going to see a movie how nice
"white swallow bath house"

well did you see what he got me for our anniversary
well first he went to see a movie
a movie hmmm i wonder why hed wanna see a movie by himself
i dont know but it wasnt the movie theater at the mall no it was that really old theater downtown the studcat i didnt know it was open
wait a minute what was the movie called
"fisting firemen 9" ive never seen 1 through 8
oh my god
uh but it must have been a real short movie though because dad came out like ten minutes later and it must have been a sad film too because he had a bunch of tissue paper with him when he came out poor old dad the movie really got to him
butters where did daddy go after the movie
to the gym
to the gym
yeah the white swallow spa
gaah
yep he went in there and wrestled with all kinds o guys he wasnt too good though this one black guy had him pinned down for fifteen minutes straight
butters are you sure about this you have to be absolutely sure
inspector butters gets all the facts i even got some neato pictures the only thing i cant figure out is why dad told you he was goin shoppin for your present when he was goin out to see the movies an wrestlin oh did you have a nice "trip" mom see you next "fall" hahaha yo- ma

oh uh pardon me sirs dad no hm
ooh butters
hi dad
oh god aaah ohhh
im glad i found ya i think i know the perfect anniversary present for mom but what are you doin with your wiener out there dad
butters you need to leave here right now you need to get out of here egeh go home and wait for me to talk to talk to you
oh well alright then well see ya at home
oh jesus no oh what have i done
everyone knows its butters
thats me
butters oh butters could you come and see me in my study real quick
uh hey dad
come here son i wanna have a talk with you
well sure thing dad
son i wanted to talk to you about lying
well i know lyings bad dad y-you told me so
yes it sure can be but there are also times when distorting the truth a little uh is appropriate these are called "little white lies"
little white lies
you see sometimes telling a little white lie is okay like for instance when you catch your father jacking off in a gay mens bath house
uh whos jack
butters the point is that i think that if you told mommy what daddy was doing tonight well she might go completely insane
oh no that wont happen dad
it wont oh good
eh no because i already told mom and shes fine
you what
butters mommy wants to take you for a little drive now
a drive oh boy i- i love a good drive is dad comin too
no sweetie daddy needs to sit and think
alright see ya in a bit dad oh boy a drive
oh jeez you wouldnt have believed how angry i was when teacher said i had to share my fingerpaints because ive been sharin them all along
butters you know that mommy loves you an awful lot dont you
well sure i do mom i love you too
and sometimes mommies do things that seem hurtful to their babies but its really for the best
oh you mean like the time you washed my mouth out with soap for sayin "nutsack" in front of grandma yeah i need to behave myself
if a mommy has to end her life she cant let her baby alone in the world to be raised by a sick pervert
well sure that makes sense i suppose yeah hey did you seen my mittens anywhere its cold out here
im going to get out of the car now butters i want you to stay put with your seat belt fastened
oh well alright mom o-o-okay then you know i think the car might be movin mom yep im pretty sure the car is movin looks like im headin for the water
shhh shhh its okay baby mommy will be with you very soon

everyone knows its butters
thats me
naw linda because you cant now say that the abductor is costa rican you have to learn to keep it straight
i cant keep it straight when you keep inventing new parts to the story
hey dont forget that im covering for you
dont forget your lies started all this
my lies may have been deceitful but your lies cover up something much more horrible than anything i ever did
happy anniversary
not now butters
oh alright then i-
butters oh butters
son i dont believe it
ah im sorry the car just rolled into the lake and it floated all the way down the river i tried callin home but it was-
oh my babys back
i aint grounded am i
no-huih no butters oh son why oh uh were gonna need you to tell a little white lie about where youve been though alright
lie
oh eh yes uh darling youre going to have to say you dont know how you got home
no you have to say that a puerto rican man dropped you off
ohhh whos gonna believe he just dropped him off
hey you stop hollerin its your anniversary
now we dont really have a choice do we
youre the one that made up the stuff about the puerto rican idiot
uh stop it mom and dad
well youre the one who couldnt back it up wit a description stupid
now gosh darn it you you listen here now i am sick of these harmless lies and l-little white lies you know you can call a shovel an ice-cream machine but its still a shovel mom and dad ah and you can call a lie whatever you want but its still a no-good stinkin lie and when you start coverin up one lie with another why now thats when you get into real trouble boy ive ive just about had it up to here with you two
butters youre as right as rain
you sure are
well i aint in trouble for hollerin at ya am i
no butters youre the best son in the whole world and i am so happy youre alive
well ah im happy youre alive too mom so now can we go to bennigans
you bet son but mommy and daddy have something they have to do first
we have an announcement to make um our son has been returned to us
wow alright
butters was missing
but that isnt all we have to say you see we learned a very important lesson tonight and it took the smarts of our young son to show us
yeah
weve learned that deception is wrong and that the only thing to ever make it right again is to come clean
yeah
you see ive been deceiving my wife for several months i was going to gay movies and bathhouses and having sex with random men who were complete strangers
ye- wait what
huho
and when i found out i went crazy i went crazy and i drove my son into the lake to kill im
uh k-kill me uh jesus christ
damn dude
so you see there was no "some puerto rican guy" he doesnt exist and so the people we owe the biggest apology to are the ramseys congressman condit and oj we gave you false hope for finding the person who hurt those close to you and were sorry now were just happy we wont have to live a life of secrets for i knew that even though some of you supported us some others were looking at me and thinking "youre a liar youre a liar" "you know somethin that youre not telling us you slimy scumbag liar" eh you know thats what people would say to me and then people would see my wife at the supermarket and they would say "hello" but theyd be thinking "ah there goes that murderer" "you got away with murder you murdering lying waste of life" and to me people might say things like "liar tell us what you know you god-damned liar" and so to both of us people all over town would be saying things like "you know god-damn well what happened to your kid so stop acting like victims and confess you murdering murderers" "confess" "liar confess" you know and thats what people would be saying to us and so we just had to come forward and tell the truth
were sorry we lied to you all it wont happen again
and now if youll excuse us this family has to get to bennigans
yeah-ah-alright
wow dude your dads a perv and your mom tried to kill you
yeah boy you fellas are sure gonna rip on me at school now
we sure are
i really wish i didnt know that stuff i guess i learned that sometimes lying can be for the best yup oh well when i want a chipotle bleu cheese bacon burger at bennigans i forget all about my dad bein queer and my mom tryin to kill me im gonna be okay
really
naw im lyin
lets go son
wuh comin dad
everyone knows its butters
thats me
