the town of south park is holding a large protest tonight outside of their police department the townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect
are your children being lured into terrorist organizations a shocking report shows that some kids in the town of south park are swearing loyalty to a murderous regime
yeah were pretty bad-ass and um this is like our fortress and you can see its really cool
and what about this way of life has attracted you
were just cool cause were tough and we fight and stuff and we can ah-
yeah yeah yeah and its like we can do whatever we want and people are scared of us its totally rad
then whyd you say it was gay before
oh my god i never said it was gay
wait he said this was gay
that is a total lie why would i say anything homophobic about the way tweek and craig make love hes a lying backstabbing jew
im stan
no doubt the growing number of kids swearing loyalty to isis could be problematic for the progressive town
here you go old girl well just have to make do
ew
spare a dollar
no i dont im sorry thank you goddammit ew mayor i didnt bust my ass to gentrify this part of town to have it overrun with homeless people
why are they all suddenly coming here
mayor what are you going to do about this my wife and i can barely eat or shop
when a town like ours has a homeless problem it must look at the root of whats causing it
its isis
what
theyre these troubled kids whove turned their backs on america theyve taken over sodosopa forced all the homeless out
why would kids in our town wanna be a part of that
theyre just bad kids rotten on the inside probably with shitty parents
son ive always tried to be a fair dad eh i i dont want to meh make you angry but why
well dad i just re-really like being a part of something i feel like its character-building and its lots of fun
fun but what do you believe in
what do we believe in we believe in something greater than ourselves and that by following our strict warrior code we believe that our faiths and our traditions are a way to a greater path - the p-p-p-path of the warrior and as long as we stay united in honor we can defeat all our enemies wow the fellas were right people are really freaked out by ninjas
okay weve just gotta be really apologetic and tell them we didnt mean it okay
jeez this is so embarrassing
what if they wont help us with the homeless
im pretty sure the police will help out if its because isis is taking over the town
officers theres kids in town who have joined isis we dont know who they are but they-
what whats that you say
the town is in danger alright we dont know what these kids are capable of
jeez im sorry weve got to work on our koholo kaloa and get the lomi lomi chicken ready for the big hoolao leao which leaves us oh not enough time to deal with isis
alright look theres homeless people all over our gentrified food and arts district if you dont stop thewe twisted kids then-
hey who was it that said "fuck the police" was that ice cube tupac oh right that was you guys sorry but i guess youll have to find somebody else to do all the difficult dirty shit you dont want to do yourselves ive gotta be ready for the luau i might even kiss a dude
so then after you told me we went over to kyle and stan when they were playing basketball remember
yeah
and we said kenny and tolkien were playing ninjas and kyle said that ninjas were gay and i said ninjas are gay but it was a question you remember
uh i thought you said it first
no nonono see now kyle got everyone remembering it wrong because he doesnt wanna get kicked out of the group thats what jews do when they get caught in a lie you cannot trust a jewish ninja butters
you guys you guys

you guys i know this is hard for all of us but to truly be ninjas we must face hard facts last night i spoke in private with our ninja leader overseas we talked a long time about jews and the hebrew faith he told me a lot i didnt know and i was able to tell him some things he did not know but after talking with that guy it is abundantly clear to me that jews cannot be ninjas i went to kyles house to talk to him about it and i found this it was then that kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed butters and stan into thinking i had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization and he almost got away with it thats when kyle tried to kill me luckily i was the faster ninja kyle knew i would never call ninjas gay when i take the gag off hes going to try and tell you that im lying now do not believe him kyle is a liar
