whos strong woman
im strong woman
youre gonna smoke the competition
im gonna smoke the competition oh no its the babies
kids kids okay what the matter
oh no i left disney+ on and it went to mulan
they dont like mulan
no because mulan is a female that identifies as male and yet the movie doesnt take the time to address real trans issues
okay okay we know mulan is outdated in creating straw dog characters to talk about trans issues daddys turning it off
-but just how many advocates have yet to be seen
alright everybody listen up as you know this school is a place where everyone should feel included our challenge is to motivate ourselves and others to create an inviting non-negative and hey stotch you got a fucking problem
no sir
now i think that what we all need are leaders who motivate by example and so i would like to inform you all that your vice-principal is competing in the strong woman competition in morrison this weekend lets hear it for her
well thank you pc principal um listen guys i just hope i can make you proud and more importantly i hope you can see that no matter who you are you can do anything weve really come a long way breaking down gender-binary bigotry and i hope i can especially inspire some of my girl students here
or those who identify as girls
yes or those who identify as girls get out there and get involved in school sports and clubs if theres something you love dont ever let anything hold you back
the first bugbear lashes out at stan with its broadsword and it hits with a 17
how much damage is that
4 + 2 slashing
okay i jump up to the bugbear and i yell "for waterdeep" and i kick it in the balls
i dont think bugbears have balls
then how do they make baby bugbears
oh hi boys uh we got some new students who want to be part of the gaming club you know tammy and nichole
ah huh ah heh heh neh no
this is a school club boys all clubs are inclusive have fun girls
hey guys
what the fuck do we do
um guys we play lots of games here at dice studz but today were playing d&d you dont just show up and start playing you have to generate characters and-
yeah we created some this morning im a human paladin and nichole is a tiefling warlock
do something eric
eheh ha guys um theyre fighting a bunch of bugbears now that are led by a 12th level druid
okay i cast vampiric touch on the druid crit
a beautiful morning in morrison colorado as we get ready for the 6th annual strong woman competition a two-day long competition of tests built to push athletes to their very limits joining me now is the current champion of the strong woman competition strong woman ms woman do you feel ready
oh yeah im ready david there are just so many amazing women athletes out here today it makes me so proud
now this is the first year that a trans woman is in the competition how do you feel about that
amazing i feel honored to be a part of history i have a lot of incredible trans friends who are athletes and so were all inspired this woman is competing
uh huh and uh have you ever actually met heather swanson
uh no ive never competed against her before no
shes not exactly your average trans athlete
well what is an "average trans athlete" honestly i find that kind of bigoted david
okay heather swanson is actually joining us now ms swanson how does it feel to be competing today
i cant tell you how free i feel now that ive started identifying as a woman now that i can compete as female im ready to smash the other girls
and is it correct you just started identifying as female two weeks ago
im not here to talk about my transition im here to kick some fuckin ass let me tell you something dingleberry
david perry
im gonna roll up the other women here and im gonna smoke em i am the strongest woman this state has ever seen
any words for the challenger ms woman
uh good luck heather
huh huh luck is for dudes
well with that lets get right to the action
arrrgh-yeahhhh hell yeah i won im a strong woman look at it its mine im the best im the strongest
so second place thats pretty damn good
yeah
i guess she just started identifying as a woman a few weeks ago doesnt really seem fair
just dont youll upset the pc babies
it is unfair it is tyrannous and it is wrong ever since these girls were allowed to join dice studz gamers club it has been a train wreck every single game they like figure out all the rules and they use the rules to like make us look stupid
in d&d they killed the dungeon master well we didnt even think it was possible to kill the dungeon master
shut up butters its not possible its just that we play board games for the themes we want to be pirates or vikings you know what the girls think about they think about red cubes versus blue cubes and how much of this equals how many victory points theyre just doing math
so theyre smarter than you and beating you at all the board games
yeth
no
no
its its just different look we started dice studz with a dream a dream that we could actually do something interesting at school just for like 60 minutes
"nothing we can do" he said "hands are tied" he said were gonna have to deal with this ourselves you guys
i think nichole and tammy are cool to play with
well you wont think theyre cool when the rest of us leave dice studz and youre left to play only solo board games
you mean like nemos war nemos war is sweet
look maybe we just gotta play harder stuff you know stuff the girls cant keep up with
hey thats not a bad idea weve been taking it easy on the girls time to show em what real board gamers play
what do real board gamers play
well if you want something hard then you need a really crunchy euro game something like a vital lacerdas escape plan or a uwe rosenburg euro
do they involve math
well all euros are pretty mathy
nope no good we need something with lots of like war and dice and thematic shit
so then you want a war miniatures game something skirmish-style like legion or blood and plunder
dude youre really into board games
alright thats it you guys dice studz gamers club is about to go tabletop miniatures
emory stop playing with your food
ill get it
hey whats going on is your girlfriend home
uh shes sort of busy right now ms swanson
just wanna tell her no hard feelings about me winning the strong woman competition
yeah you already told her that at the competition
you got a problem with me cause its starting to seem like you have a problem with me
whats going on- oh hi heather
i was just stopping by to make sure youre not too beat up
oh thats really cool im sorry but i have all the kids right now and theyre-
oh where are the little kiddos id love to meet em oho hey kids whoa theres a lot of you your mom must be a strong woman to take care of all oyou of course i have the strong woman trophy though heheheheh just kidding right
look why dont you just get out of here
oh sounds like someone here is a transphobe
dont you dare im trans peoples biggest supporter what i think you are is a terrible sport
transphobe
youd better knock it off
just dont youre gonna upset the pc babies
and if you dare call me transphobe again im gonna-
youre gonna what beat me up youre gonna beat me up transphobe yeah i didnt think so see you later kids come on over and see old auntie heather if you want to see what a real strong woman is like
are you feeling what im feeling
what do you mean
i dont know what it is but something about that woman just doesnt seem right
now back to pc babies
hey guys hope its cool we brought kelly she wants to be in the club too
oho yes thats very cool girls were just setting up todays game its a pirate miniatures game called blood & plunder
yeah we saw it on the schedule
we love blood and plunder are we gonna play like a four-on-four skirmish with two different factions
whoa you painted your miniatures
yeah who wants unpainted miniatures right
whered you learn to do that
we watch youtube tutorials you can find a much on bgg
i love bgg
oh cool do you watch game night
excuse me were going to play the six-hour long very thematic nemesis
oh cool we just watched the tutorial for that on dice tower
and now back to women in sports with janet spears
our next guest has been really lighting it up in womens competitions since shes identified as female two weeks ago shes won every female sport shes entered please welcome heather swanson
well thank you janet its a great pleasure to be here i know that im an inspiration to all women and trans athletes everywhere
yes we are all truly inspired
now there are some women out there who just want to run and hide im talkin to you strong woman you still dare call yourself that your name is a joke because ol heather swanson here will beat you anywhere anytime at anything
hey dont let her get to you strong
shes not getting to me
i i-i dont know why she has such a grudge against you and i-
because i know her
what do you mean
its blade jaggart he - she - is my ex-boyfriend
what
back when we were together he was such an asshole when i finally broke up with him he said one day he was going to get me back and now hes got us both by the balls
but then she doesnt really care about trans people or women
he hates wome- she hates women when i left him he felt he got beat by a girl and nothing makes blade jaggart more crazy than getting beat by a girl
i didnt even know people like that existed
it is unfair it is tyrannous and it is wrong dice studz is a board game group that brings thrills and laughter to dozens of boys at our school but that laughter is being turned into screams as girls constantly invade with their unfairness
the girls found eric on the first round of fury of dracula
yes inclusion is wonderful but we have to admit that boys and girls are simply different in some ways that can sometimes make competitions unfair have you ever seen how girls do their homework they do it that night meticulously going over every detail and often finishing before they absolutely have to this is how girls are with board game rule books before we even start playing theyve already strategized a way to win leaving others in the dust and now id like for you to hear from my friend scott who has diabetes
my name is scott malkinson and i have diabetes
terminal diabetes
i have terminal diabetes board games are the only thing that give me relief from the physical and mental anguish i experience every day
wow scott i didnt know it was that bad
neither did i dice studz is my only shot at happiness please dont let outdated school policies destroy it
wow thank you scott diabetes everyone we hope that our presentation has helped to change your minds about school clubs in our country if not we will be back every single day please let dice studz be for studs
womens mma fighting is growing in popularity and no other female fighter is as explosive as heather swanson
eee-yeahhh
heather your story is an inspiration to sports fans everywhere congratulation on your "shocking" success
i just hope i can motivate little girls out there motivate them to understand that i will beat them at any sport they try motivate them to run away like that chicken shit strong woman did because i-
alright alright thats enough you uh you made your point heather we get it okay
oh hey transphobe this is a nice surprise
oh god what is he doing
look everyone i know were all a little afraid to have any opinions on this stuff but um there can be situations where its not so easy to what i mean is i
i didnt count on being the best since identifying as a woman
yeah no shit cause you went through puberty as a male so your bodys completely different
and thats exactly what a transphobe would say
i told you not to call me a transphobe all i want is to have a discussion
transphobe
aw shit
ahhh isnt this nice you guys clean fresh air soothing sounds just us boys and star trek ascendancy"
uh hey fellas come quick you gotta see
see what
well its the girls they started their own board game club at the school
"board girls" how lame is that
the fuck is this
wow
well this is like what you said dice studz would be eric
oh hey guys welcome to board girls want to have a look around so over here we have our co-op games i think they’re doing “sub terra” right now and there we do our deck and engine builders have you tried “inuit” it’s really cool we have miniatures painting over there and most of our miniatures gaming happens in that area
hey those girls are playing “crisis protocol” that’s not even out yet
yeah we get advanced copies of games because our club reviews them for our gaming channel
hey boys you need to get out okay no boys in the girls school clubs come on lets go
what who says
new school policy came down from the top now get your asses outta there
well who made up that stupid rule
yeah who made up that stupid rule
we now return to pc babies
are you just not gonna come home
how am i gonna look my kids in the eyes strong since they were born weve taught them to accept and fight for those who are marginalized that theres no gray area when it comes to inclusion and acceptance when i go back all theyre gonna see is a big fat hypocrite and now ive just used a word to shame people with weight issues
p you cant just shut down because youre afraid of how the babies are gonna react
i didnt shove him - her - for being trans i shoved her because shes your ex-boyfriend and shes being a dick do you think the pc babies will see the nuance/but theyre right strong i shoved a trans person no matter what i have no right to judge her do you think- could you try to explain it to the babies
you know how they are theyre babies their minds are made up before anyone says anything
then ive really got only one thing i can do i have to try and make things right with heather swanson
uh hey students as you know weve had some issues here at the school that were working very hard to correct so today we are honored to have a motivational speaker she is the current strong woman competition and also the champion in womens mma fighting and in womens wrestling please welcome the inspiring heather swanson
yeeaahhhh fuck yeeaahhhh
hello boys and girls im here to talk to you because apparently your school leaders have failed you im gonna tell you something kids theres only one thing that matters in this world and thats being the best your vice-principal teaches you girls to be strong but she comes in second you got anything to say about that pc principal
no ms swanson
"no ms swanson" you see people dont look up to losers they look up to champions every time i beat another woman i feel better
dude i really like this person
and thats why im the best because heather swanson doesnt get beat i work to be the best at everything and heather swanson will beat any other woman any time anywhere
bet you cant beat nichole at blood rage
what wha-what did you say transphobe
yeah but i bet you cant beat tammy at war of the ring
you dont disrespect a champion little girls you think heather swanson doesnt know board games i was playing board games before your mom even crapped you out of her vagina
okay so then lets do it bitch
oh its onnn
do you think thats fair you only won cause you dumb girls memorized the rule books when i play games i just wanna be a pirate or a spaceman
thats right you and your stupid rules
i may identify as a woman now but i grew up a boy so you have an unfair advantage over me
yeah an unfair advantage stupid girls come on ms swanson we can go make our own club
you sure youre ready for this
i just wanna get it over with
mommy yay
yes kids and look who else is here
daddy yeah daddy dada
dada i love you
i i dont understand
they dont care they must see the nuance to this whole situation
youre right they realize that raising a gender-based issue of strength doesnt necessarily make one a bigot or a bully all this time we were worried what the pc babies would think
and we didnt realize that our little babies are growing up
