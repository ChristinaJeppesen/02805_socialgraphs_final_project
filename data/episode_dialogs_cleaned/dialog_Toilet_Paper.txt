im confused did ally sheedy take that personality
yes dude
kyle its very simple we followed ally sheedy out to her car but on the way we were accosted by five scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests which were administered at the scientology center in denver until 1045 at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in rancho de burritos rojos south of castle rock and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger named gary bushwell arriving home at 1146 you got it

josh meyers tped over six hundred houses in less than a year hes a real monster
i just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think
just remember hed toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance hes the last cell on your left
hello josh my name is officer barbrady im with the south park police
thats a terrible cologne youre wearing officer you should try something more casual
i was hoping you could help me solve a toilet-papering case
and why would i do that because im such a charming fella
uh please i need your help what would you want in return
due to the harsh nature of my crimes they dont allow me to have toilet paper in my cell you can imagine how bothersome that becomes
you know i cant give you toilet paper josh
no but it was worth a try wasnt it tell me something officer why is it that you police such a small town you must have had larger inspirations what happened to those big-city dreams
well thats kind of personal
quid pro quo officer tell me what i want to know and ill help you catch whoever toilet-papered that house
look kid i have very little time to catch whoever toilet-papered that house tell me what you know
are those the crime scene photos let me see them yes yes not bad work not bad at all these toilet-paperers are professionalsat least one of them is
so you think there was more than one why
tell me something first when you went to the academy you had something to prove you wanted to protect and serve but mostly you wanted to protect yourself who were you protecting yourself from officer barbrady
oh all right all right my uncle charles used to hit me with a belt
thank you your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins parents notice that much toilet paper missing so they would have to have bought it themselves find out where the toilet paper came from officer and you just might catch your man
stan kenny can i talk to you guys for a second i think we have the counselor and the principal fooled but we need to talk about kyle
what about him
come on you know hes losing it hes gonna crack
(i think so too)
kyle cant take the heat hes gonna sing like a canary then were all gonna take the fall for what we did
ha-ey fellas
butters
look you guys all it takes is for one of us to crack and we all know who the weakest link is
so what should we do
we have no choice we have to kill kyle
dude were not killing kyle
(yeah)
why not
kyles not gonna say anything alright
he almost spilled the beans in the counselors office he cant even keep the story straight im telling you guys hes weak hes weak and hell be the end of all of us
you wanted to see me officer barbrady
yes thanks for coming mr bell a house was tped in south park and i need to see if you can identify the toilet paper i recovered from the scene im sorry i have to do this
oh my god
is this toilet paper from your store
its difficult to tell its so decayed i wait a minute yes yes i recognize the floral pattern now
positive id on the toilet paper
who would do this to toilet paper who
mr bell do you remember anyone suspicious buying toilet paper in the last few days
suspicious like how
well like someone who was black or mexican or middle eastern
nnoo the only mexican guy i recall bought toasted tarts and chips and we dont allow middle eastern people in the store oh my god
whats this all about cartman
i just wanted to see how youre doing kyle why dont we go out for a little boat ride
a boat ride
i just thought we should find a private place to talk
well okay
could you help me put this cement block and chain in the boat okay lets go so how are things kyle
terrible every time i close my eyes i see the house we tped i see the tears of our art teacher and hear the screams of her daughters
and you feel like you have to confess
i dont know what to do part of me feels like i wanna end it all now tell people what heppened you know i never knew how beautiful this pond was before so cold the world can feel like that so calm on the outside as if nothing bad ever happens ow what the hell are you doing cartman
im killing you but unfortunately i could only afford a wiffle ball bat so its gonna take a while
cartman
dont fight it kyle it will only take longer just slip into sweet unconsciousness
you wanna kill me fine i cant live like this anymore go ahead do it
wont be long kyle
josh i need your help
the answer is right in front of you but you cant see it
how do you mean
tell me the toilet paper was it quilted
yes
single-sheet
no two-ply what what does that tell you
why does one toilet-paper houses
to get revenge
no that is incidental your toilet-paperers wanted to transform the art teachers house thus transforming her entire occupation
what do you mean
your uncle who hit you with a belt was he a large man
i dont have time for this kid
did he stink like bayer when he came home from work all powoor from playin down at the pool house
alright alright my dad dressed me up like a little girl on poker nights and he made me sit on all my uncles laps
whoa uh oh thank you your toilet-paperers are most likely students in the art teachers class students who arent very good at art
oh of course one of her students
fly along now officer barbrady youve got some arrests to make fly fly flyyy fly fly flyyy
josh were you doing the silly voice for the policeman again

cartman what are you doing
im getting rid of our problem kyle will be dead in a matter of hours
you dont have to kill kyle dude the police made an arrest and the person confessed
they did
they did

well im just a little asshole is what i am when god made me he must have not been payin very close attention cause i turned out wrong just plain wrong
officer barbrady butters didnt tp that house

because it was-
wiffle ball anyone anyone care for a nice game of wiffle ball
you know its not my parents im worried about its my girlfriend carrie why she lives in michigan but when she finds out about this woooo smokey is she gonna be sore she might even break up with me and it would serve me right too

yeah that makes it even worse
bu eh kyle you dont seem to understand were were not gonna get punished for this ever
i know
so so then how can you feel bad
he feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it
but hes not gonna get in trouble
it doesnt matter if you get in trouble of not you can still feel bad i think youre right kyle maybe we should confess
(yeah maybe we should)
what eh hey you guys theres nothing to feel bad about were were off scot-free
we feel bad for other people
for oth-er uh oww ih ih ih is it that you think you might get in trouble later
