ehhha-a-a-ah
huh- hold on just a second there principal victoria i think i may know what the problem is
timmiihh
yes of course
what
i think maybe timmy is suffering from something called "attention deficit disorder" or add its very common in kids his age
oh
timmiihh
well that certainly would explain it
it should be easy enough to find out they have tests for that kind of thing now mkay
oolih oo livin a lie timmehuh
alright this is a very simple test which should determine without a doubt whether or not timmy has attention deficit disorder
good
mkay
timmih
egh now timmy im going to read you a book called "the great gatsby" by f scott fitzgerald at the end of the novel ill ask you a few questions are you ready
timmih
okay here we go "in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that ive been turning over in my mind ever since" "so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past"
ha-a-a-a-a-h
okay now timmy can you tell me in chapter 7 what kind of car did gatsby drive
timmih
well that settles it

wooo
we did it dude
listen to them they really love me wooo
wooo
yes im a rocker
tonight we analyze the new rock sensation timmeo the controversial new band that has taken the country by storm already playing at several large venues this month the band prepares for its biggest gig lolapalooblaza where they will open for phil collins but phil collins is not happy
well i thinks its a horrible tragedy idnt it i mean people arent gonna see timmy for his musical skills theyre laughin at im and i think you shouldnt laugh at people with disabilities
hah haha
society has to learn how to be more compassionate this is gonna stop if i have to stop it myself
dude did you see that stuff phil collins was saying about timmy
yeah what a dick timmys five times more talented than he is
hey guys have you been takin your ritalin

no dude you gotta try it it makes you feel good
(good)
hello there children
hello chef
(hello chef)
hows it goin
very well thank you
(very well thank you)
everythings fine why
because were on ritalin
what
we all have attention deficit disorder so we all started taking ritalin
it really takes the edge off man you should try it
so thats why all you children are acting so damned boring
thats correct chef
damnit children you dont need drugs to make you pay attention in school in my day if we didnt pay attention we got a belt to the bottom now theyre tryin to cure everything with drugs
yes but now we dont have any homework so we can go see timmy play downtown at mile high stadium
oh boy oh boy
(oh boy)
oh it makes me sick those damned psychologists prescribe all kinds of medicines to you children without even carin about the side effects
but there are no side effects chef
no not at all
rown
did you guys see that
see what
youre watching mtv the cool brainwashing twelve-year-old-and-younger station that hides behind a slick image were so cool that we decide whats cool and now mtv news the news that is singlehandedly dumbing down our country which is cool heres your host kurt loder
why am i still doing this ive got to be the oldest person in this network by at least 40 years
kurt loder didnt just say that no way he did just say it but just to be cool thats what makes him cool you think kurt loder is cool and now the news thats cool
well its only two weeks until lalapalalababa and the headlining band has changed now headlining the event is timmy the new hit sensation out of colorado this news came as a shock to the performer that was going to headline lalapalabala phil collins
well i think the sad question is "where are the parents in all this" i mean that kids parents are lettin him be exploited and they dont even seem to care
and so phil collins decided to travel to south park and personally pay timmys parents a visit
well i mean why are you lettin em do this to your son dont you see that everyones just laughin at him
richarrrrd
helennnn
oodleahah
phil collins warns that a novelty band that makes fun of the handicapped should not be allowed to play lalapalablalala and vows to do everything in his power to stop it phil collins by the way divorced his wife via fax and then married a 27-year-old im kurt loder and thats the news
okay children lets settle down huhh i mean it i want quiet my god mr hat these children are so boring on ritalin huh ah alright children today were gonna learn about human reproduction what do you think about that vaginas and penises butt sex well dammit eric dont you have some smartass thing to say

look i used to be in a band too genesis and all those bastards did was hold me back and hold me back but then finally i went solo and thats when i started writing really great songs but look if you happen to be on the sidelines you know bein more of a cheerleader than a player well then i guess you should stay on as timmys shadow

no you see we learned something today yeah sure we laughed at timmy but whats wrong with laughter just because we laugh at something doesnt mean we dont care about it timmy made us smile and playing made timmy smile so where was the harm in that the people that are wrong are the ones that think people like timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the publics eye the cool thing about timmy being in a band was that he was in your face and you had to deal with him whether you laughed or cried or felt nothing thats why timmy rules
