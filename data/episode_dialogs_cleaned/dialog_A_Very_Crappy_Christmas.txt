honey can we go inside for a second well its decided kids tomorrow were gonna bring back the spirit of christmas
ho ho ho merry christmas you guys only three shopping days until- god-damnit hey merry christmas asshole
nobodys paying any attention
ew i almost stepped in it
well it was a good effort boys but im gonna have to close shop nobodys buyin anything an i cant afford to keep this furnace runnin oh and boys theres some crap on the sidewalk there watch out
not one toy i guess this yeear everyones content to celebrate with candles and love
this is hopeless were just gonna have to face that the commercialism has been sucked out of christmas
and in other news tonight it appears that everyone is officially sick of christmas in an spc poll 38% said they were fed up and tired of the holiday 5% said they were indifferent to it and a whopping 57% they would quick bon jovi square in the balls if given the opportunity
well i think people are just fed up with the crowded shopping and the credit-card bills uh i i think that the holiday just has become a joke
you know its just that a lot of people dont really believe in the whole jesus thing anymore you know so whats to celebrate
oh yeah right in the balls man right square in the balls
well the holiday spirit may be gone from south park but at least our faith in each other remains strong
in south park
oh really
dude change the channel this is too depressing
good grief we need a christmas tree for our play
oh jesus not this thing again
how come everyone in cartoons has such big heads
alright everyone weve got to get on with our play
jesus this sucks all they keep doin is dancing around
yeah this thing really falls apart in the second act
and why is it that on charlie brown cartoons everyone talks like this
my mom could make a better christmas special than this
hey thats it oh my god thats totally it its so simple
what dude
we can get everyone back into the christmas spirit by making our very own animated christmas special and showing it to everybody in town
we dont know anything about animation
how hard can it be look at it
hey yeah we can make a little animated santa claus and jesus and it can star us instead of these little round-headed guys
(yeah right awesome)
yeah and we can call it "the spirit of christmas"
ogh this is terrible johnson our whole towns economy is going right in the toilet weve got to get everybody back in the christmas spirit
mayor some adorable children are here to see you
meugh send them in
mayor we have the solution to your problem
you do
were gonna make a short animated christmas card that everyone can watch and play it on the screen at the old drive-in
itll have everything jesus santa and when people see it theyll just have to get in the spirit all we need is three hundred dollars for our budget
an animated christmas card kids that just may be the dumbest idea ive ever heard ever
awww
but at this point im willing to try anything johnson cut them a check for three hundred dollars
alright
you guys go tell butters to start making the cutoouts im gonna go tell mr hankey the good news
now you put that vase down put that vase down thats a very expensive vase dont you throw that vase

its not that father its well i dont feel like im really a part of christmas
but son youre a hankey we love christmas
come on its time to sit around the tree
were having a talk honey
god-damnit its christmas and were gonna be a happy family around the tree
autumn youre drunk alright now just go help the other kids they cant get their stockings up
thats not the only thing that cant get up around here
now come on son dont be so down
why were just pieces of crap christmas isnt for us
christmas is about feeling good thats for everybody
i see the nativity theres angels shepherds and sheep but no poo all the christmas movies santa elves reindeer no poo im not a part of it
no youre not a part of it cornwallis youre all of it dont you see
im nothing but crap
but crap is everything everything that lives on earth poos in some wayand thats how the cycle happens each and every dayjust look at the green green grass and the birds up in the skyits all here because of poo and now ill tell you whygrass its eaten by cattle which is eaten by women and menit fuses with their bodies and becomes poo againand that poo goes through the sewer where its dumped into the seaand its eaten by the plankton and becomes the fishes mealand then that bigger fish with the poo still insideswims up near the shore and gets eaten aliveby the grizzly bear that poos on a dead piece of sandso it can spring to life and become food for the landits the poo of the antelope the poo of the giraffeit falls onto the earth and becomes the blades of grassthe grass is eaten by the cattle which comes out the other endto make food for the humans and start all over againyou see son youre not an insignificant part of life you are life
but how can i be that giraffe and blade of grass and a human i dont control what they do
just like your heart beats without you thinking about it so too your giraffes and your humans do what they do without you even thinkin about it but it is all one life form it is all you
i think i see nowim the poo of the antelope that flows down to the ground
becomes the grass of tomorrow
yeah
which the grazers turn around
so im the leg of a leopard and the wings of a hen
which becomes dinner for the human and turns back to poo againthats the circle the circle of poo
okay heres the script but it doesnt have an ending
no ending well we cant animate until we have our voices recorded so wed better just record what we have and figure out the ending later
okay talk directly in the mike and dont hit any hard ps
whats a hard p
