alright everyone listen up i dont know about you but i for one am sick and tired of hate speech that serves to marginalize others
is it him
yes its him pc principal
you know if theres one thing that makes me sick its when a race thinks theyre superior and dont know how to check their privilege
im not one of them im not one of them
an african-american flips a turtle over on its back a transgender filipino comes and sees the helpless turtle baking in the sun what color is the filipinos father i didnt think you were human

butters get to the bathroom now
alright kyle whats this about
jimmys dead
what
i know the whole story pc principal killed him and tried to kill leslie but she got away
(are you fuckin serious dude)
pc principal is part of a huge network of radicals who kill everyone who doesnt follow their pc ideology
how do you know all this
because leslies with me im keeping her safe
heh kyles got a girlfriend
it gets worse someone in this town helped these people come here that person faked the bill cosby joke to get principal victoria fired
who would use a cosby joke to push their own agenda
i think its obvious stans dad
kyle
stan your dad is one of them he had to be the one to let them in
youre letting paranoia and suspicion get the better of you
theres no way to know who we can trust
so what do we do now
theres only one thing we can do we have to get guns
guns
its the only way for us to be safe
kyle even if we thought it would help protect us how are we all gonna get our hands on guns
alright cool we got guns so now what
(now we need to steal a car and escape)
i already feel a lot safer
you guys lay low and watch your backs im gonna go keep leslie protected
hey dont fall too hard partner do i look sweet butters

jee-sus what am i on trial or something god-damn you guys are really acting strange
alright were good nobody suspects a thing
take a look at this
weve got everything from pc principals hard drive he was on to the gentrification around the world and he was convinced that whatever was responsible wasnt human
not human then what
i dont care if theyre aliens or vampires we need to round them up fast and fuck them till theyre dead
you dont wanna fuck a vampire youll get hepatitis
oh girlfriend im well beyond that
oh my god dont you see what this means if something not human is gentrifying the entire world soon no human will be able to afford it theyre trying to price our species out of existence
well how do you like my new apartment
what happened to you nathan i always thought you were a nice kid now youve got a gun
huh everyones gettin one of these now jim nobody knows whom to trust
yeah well guns are never the answer
dont you kinda wish youd had one back when leslie betrayed you and nearly beat you to death
oh i guess it would have been a decent answer then tou-t-t-t touch√©
you see ive got expensive tastes jimmy i like good food organic pressed juices and ive got a thing for high-class prostitutes have you been introduced to my current girlfriend
my name is classi with an i and a little dick hanging off the c that bends around and fucks the l out of the a s s
nice to meet you classi
all i had to do was work for the ads and i got everything i wanted my own loft with all of shitpatown right at my doorstep all it took was some pc and the whole thing was set in motion
oh great so now ads are using pc for their own gain thats a new low

the gun show
yeah its gonna have everything and with guns bein so popular practically everyone in town is gonna be in attendance
the entire town in one location oh my god
the principal has become our biggest problem we need a news headline that will draw him back to town
oh youre gonna sponsor my content some more baby im all ears
ive got to get to the super school news hey classi you think you can get me my crutches
mah i dont think nathan would like that
you seem like a reasonable person do you really wanna live in a world controlled by ads i mean come on classi
no its c-lasssi with an i the little dick that hangs off the c fucks the l out of the ass cl-asssi
sorry my bad look im a news reporter claaassi and in a world where ads control the news theres no way to be sure anyone is ever hearing the truth
truth about what
we cant just hide kyle we have to let people know pc is the enemy before its too late
leslie we dont know who is on their side we have to stay safe
the principal is going to try and make up some crazy story thats what pc people do you have to get in front of everyone and tell them what youve learned
i gave up giving speeches
but why i came to you because i had heard how good you were at getting messages across that and because i thought you were cute
im sure id have no problem giving a speech if you could be by my side
well i cant go with you you know its too dangerous
not if we go somewhere thats completely safe from any violence
where
the gun show
gun show
therell be so many guns that nothing bad can happen
someone purposely had principal victoria replaced with a new principal
yes they wanted to use his pc as a means to start gentrification in our town
thats why we thought pc principal was behind it but now we know they were just using his pc abilities to service their own needs
when the pussy-crusher story came out in super school news it started to make pc principal question himself he started digging for answers they didnt like that so they tried to distract and mislead him with this sorry thats an ad for mcdonalds hold on with this oh n oh theres that ad again god these things are annoying anyways whatever these beings are they try to keep anyone from knowing the truth from ugh i dont wanna see a slideshow pc principal said something was trying to divert and distract his subconscious mind with this
wait thats leslie oh my god its kyle
kyle
kyle has been protecting leslie theyre together hes been making everyone feel paranoid and saying youre the enemy dad
well then its time to go ask kyle why he sold out his own kind
how will we get him to talk
were going to kill him with kindness but instead of kindness were going to use guns
yeah
yeah
come on lets go shelly you take care of grandpa

i need your phone to call officer barbrady and we have to get to that gun show fast
quick to the classi mobile
welcome back to the south park gun show weve had over 2000 gorgeous guns come through this arena today its been whittled down to seven the winners from each group david take us down theh line
first we have the beautiful yorkshire 33mm with proud owner stephen stotch
an absolutely gorgeous gun david
the playful and lovely australian semiautomatic owned by father maxi
and theres the mayor with her delightful rhodesian ridgeback shotgun-rifle mix
thats a favorite of the crow here always a favorite at these shows
thats a nice gun right there
the judge now asking to see that yorkshire 33mm up close
and there it is just a beautiful gun in motion everybody loves it looks like the judge wants to take another look at that shotgun-rifle mix
and next up will be the-
nobody move
everyone just stay where you are
and it looks like the gun show is under attack david
yes six armed gunmen have entered the arena one of which is carrying an absolutely gorgeous little pekingese glock 17
listen to me everyone there are beings who are purposely gentrifying the earth so that humans can no longer afford it weve been looking for kyle broflovski somebodys hiding him
dont listen to them the real conspiracy here are the pc extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesnt think like they do you son of a bitch stan how could you have sided with the enemy
fuck you kyle youre the enemy
you both got it wrong
jimmy
officer barbrady
classi
randy
kyle i know you probably thought leslie was a kind caring girl but the truth is shes just an ad
an ad
theyve become sentient theyve taken human form you cant tell whats human and whats an ad anymore
oh jeez are you serious how am i supposed to fuck an ad to death
woah flippin ads theyre such a pain in the ass
you told me jimmy was dead
so now we know who got principal victoria fired
nobody move okay everyone just stay where you are
mackey
yes i wanted principal victoria fired but i didnt want any of this
you got me fired why
eighteen years of answerin to you eighteen years of you always tellin me what to do
if you had problems with me why didnt you just talk to me
you never listen nobody listens to me they just expect me to listen to them
maybe we should have realized that sometimes the counselor needs counseling
i dont know maybe i got manipulated by these ads too somehow but i should have been a better person
we all could be better people all of us we all played a part
maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more care about each other
if were gonna defeat our enemies thats what its gonna take all of us together
if only wed had these before huh
every time you block us we get smarter every time you try to stop us we are more if one plan fails we will plan another you will never be rid of ads
hey leslie your species took pc and twisted it for evil purposes that pisses me off youre expelled
yes dude
well i guess theres just one last thing to take care of
why did it have to be like this why couldnt we try to live on this planet together maybe were not perfect beings but we built a better town we didnt need you to do that and well keep on trying to make it better
randy youre yelling at a whole foods
go on get outta here we know others will know it isnt going to be so easy not anymore
alright everyone listen up i dont know about you but i for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species we have a new enemy out there an almost invisible foe that is so bigoted so racially biased they actually think we should all die they are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair but no matter how hard they hit us we cannot let them take from us our pc and so i have been asked to stay on as your principal a lot of changes will happen in the coming months the bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who dont is that we have the burning desire for social justice we are at war but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding non-biased and politically correct as possible
this is going to be really hard
