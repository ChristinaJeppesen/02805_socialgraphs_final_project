the park county school district is holding a parent meeting tomorrow and officials are hopeful that students can return to school on monday
wow thats great
oh i dont know if this is a good idea
the openings come on the heels that scientists are getting closer to finding the origins of the covid pandemic
y-yes weve been able to trace the virus and confirm that it did in fact come from a seedy part of china
ha told ya
and in fact weve pinpointed the virus to a certain bat in wuhan
a bat in wuhan
what we still dont understand is how did a transmitted disease get from a bat to a human how can a virus jump species like that we just dont know
hello oh oh hey you could use some tegridy china
heres to china haha

look um do you remember when we fucked that bat in wuhan
ive fucked a lot of bats
well ive only fucked one i remember right after i got really sick and this was all back in october
jesus christ you fucker you started all this
you told me to fuck the bat
you didnt quarantine yourself after you got home
nobody knew anything about covid when i fucked the bat i thought i just came back from china with the flu look we cant let scientists find that bat my wife is crazy if she finds out i started the pandemic shes gonna be a total bitch about it

so
"so" what the fuck is- you really wanna go back to that slavery
i want an education i want to be able to compete for a job when i get older
you crazy psychotic kyle we need to get a lawyer to stop schools from forcing us back now whatever your messed-up beliefs are about "wanting to go to school"
you really wanna spend the next year on zoom
you dont have to be on zoom theres a million ways around it mark my words kyle first theyll force us back to school then theyll take social distancing away from us completely and ill be out of my room having to hang out with you

mkay welcome parents to this all-school town meeting to talk about how were gonna get your kids back into the classroom can everyone hear me okay okay well parents weve made some amazing adjustments and hirings mkay we believe we can welcome students back on monday mkay
how are you going to do this
yeah what happens when my son is sitting in a room with craig tucker whose father doesnt even wear a mask outside
oh here we fucking go again stop mask shaming stotch
well its really not a mask if you wear it down around your chin thats a chin diaper
theres no real proof that a mask even fuckin does anything
spoken like a true redneck
oh fuck you
okay okay everyone alright mmkay i just muted everybody okay now if we dont get along ill just sit here with you all on mute okay now lets try this again
i saw wendys mother not wearing a mask in the changing room at ross
the fuck are you doing spying on me in the changing room i was at ross-
okay boom youre all muted mmkay i can do this all day now weve made changes at the school and we feel prepared to welcome your students back mr donovan
i dont care what changes youve made my son clyde is not going to class
and that is your prerogative mute mmkay mrs marsh
i thought that the issue was the teachers not coming back
that is correct our teaching staff does not feel safe to return but we have hired all new teachers mkay these are people who have recently lost their jobs due to recent events and are desperate for work mmkay so theyll do just about anything
what new teachers
alright men as you all know due to recent events totally beyond our control we have lost most of our funding but this new venture will be great and i know we will all thrive as elementary schoolteachers this might be our last chance at a job so i dont want any unnecessary deaths ahp ahp no unnecessary deaths and lets show this town just what great leaders we can be this is gonna be great
all over south park this morning children are getting ready for their first day of class and as they do scientists say theyre closer to finding a vaccine
oh cool turn it up
tom im standing in front of the newly built viral research center where scientists say they have found the animal which started the coronavirus the creature was located in china and then flown to the facility here where scientists are studying it thoroughly
heyheyhey whoa whoa w-what are you guys doing
they think theyre about to find the vaccine
yes now that we have the animal in our possession well finally be able to unlock what caused a virus to jump from it to humans
does it matter what started coronavirus who cares what started coronavirus you guys are being racist we dont need to watch this wheres the remote this is this is racist television and were not gonna watch it
i want to hear this randy
no no you know what you guys are horrible just just stop it right now
you traced the virus to wuhan but what you found was not a bat is that correct
nono the virus did not come from a bat
you guys- what what did he say
we were able to break down the virus enough to see there was actually no bat involved
no bat involved no bat involved oh yeah oh yeah it wasnt a bat it wasnt a bat it wasnt a bat in your face in your face it wasnt a bat
when we tracked the virus we found it did originate in wuhan but from a species called pholidota
and what exactly is pholidota
its a pangolin and here it is right over here
whats a pangolin mom
im not even sure do you know what a pangolin is randy randy
do you know what a pangolin is dad
haha haha dude i still cant believe you fucked that bat haha
okaaay okaaay shhhh
haha you really let her have it oh boy
okay i dont wanna think about that right now mickey
im just impressed thats all i mean if you can handle a bat then
then what
you ever have sex with a pangolin
what the fuck is a pangolin
ha ha ha whoa shit
alright children welcome back to class im your new teacher detective harris and this is our homeroom teachers assistant officer johnston lets start the day off with some math does anyone understand math who would like to lead the class with some math
pandemic theres a pandemic you cant make me go to school you cant argh araraaagh nonono nonono you cant make me you hear me
i dont know if i can do this mitch i fuckin hate kids i cant be a teacher
its all we got sir let me try kids alright come on lets settle down now were gonna do some fingerpaints you got that youre gonna fingerpaint a marsupial of your choice or a fun thing you did over the summer
you cant make us stay here this is a violation of our freedom whos with me guys
now listen were gonna start fingerpaintin right now
oh my god i forgot how much it sucks to be around everybody i think im gonna be sick all over kyle
fuck you
thats enough
ow
got im
aaand here it is this is the pangolin we tracked down in china the animal that could lead us to a vaccine the mysteries of covid can be unlocked by our studies of this creature ill just ask you all to keep a good distance away obviously we cant let anything happen to this pangolin you see this pangolins dna has mutated which is what we believe started it all
the pangolin has mutated how
were not completely sure but we believe now that something somehow got its dna up into the pangolin
how exactly could that happen
well i-its almost like another creature somehow inserted its dna up into the pangolin
perhaps some other species somehow mated with the pangolin
oh come on what kind of animal would have sex with a pangolin
yeah look how ugly that thing is
yeah yeah
okay okay
again what really matters is that we decode the foreign dna inside the pangolin that would be the key to the vaccine perhaps even a cure we have to know what raped the pangolin
oh so now it was "rape"
excuse me sir who are you this tour is for scientists that specialize in pandemics are you a pandemic specialist
yeah im a pandemic specialist im making one right now
uh-kay anyway if you all follow me now to the micro labs i can show you the containment system for once a vaccine is able to be tried
mkay mmkay parents can everyone hear me okay everyone listens up we dont want anyone to panic okay but there has been a covid exposure here at the school okay one of our fourth graders was taken to the hospital a couple of hours ago okay but we think tolkiens gonna be okay now due to county protocol everyone that was in the school now has to quarantine for two weeks so we will be keeping your kids here and the teachers will be staying with them
alright students shut up i know this situation is not ideal but we all have to quarantine together for two weeks
this is bullshit
you dont want to infect your families do you you were all exposed to a student here who was taken to the hospital due to covid yes
uh we were there and token was actually taken to the hospital because you guys shot him
yes due to covid if it werent for covid all the previous teachers would have still been here we wouldnt have been in the class and nobody would have gotten shot therefore the young man is in the hospital due to covid
it was covid-related
that doesnt make any sense
and scientists are asking all south park county residents to keep an eye out for the creature once again the pangolin escaped from the facility yesterday and many people are fearing the worst scientists say that even though they have samples from the pangolin they now dont have what they need for a vaccine
yes you see what we needed was the foreign dna that was up inside the pangolin its whatever that dna was that was our key to the cure
hello anyone home got a delivery here needs a signature
oh okay
oh he-hey if youre gonna come any closer would you mind wearing a you know chin diaper
oh sorry
here you go just sign right there have a nice day oh and hey im really loving the pandemic special
yeah thanks
why did you send that to me
haha because youre a dead man marsh its your dna that they need for a vaccine haha
yeah i know but i cant just turn myself in
this isnt personal marsh its business im having you killed then secretly well send your dna to the scientists for the vaccine haha
this is all your fault mickey mouse you made the deal with the devil when you sold your mulan shit to china and then you took me out and sold me on how great china was and how we should all suck their dick you made me lose my tegridy and anything special that i had- special wait a minute thats it
whats it haha
the special the pandemic special thats how we can get my dna into people we can vaccinate them without them even knowing
what are you talkin about
just give me a couple of more days before you have me killed i-i think i know a way out of this
randy
shhh hey jimbo
wha-what are you-
its okay jimbo i think i might have a cure for covid youre just gonna have to trust me okay
uh uh

i know this bullshit sucks but butters will be okay
and what if hes not what if butters is actually starting to lose his mind what if he feels his body shutting down right now

mr president dr fauci is on line 2 and the fda chief is on line 3

stan this is gonna be very difficult for a child to understand but i made a promise to the american people- to get rid of all the mexicans
but the pandemic isnt just killing mexicans
its killing a lot of them ive gone over the statistics stan all i have to do now is sort of guide the avalanche in the right direction and im fulfilling my promises to the american people i was doing a crap job until this pandemic happened
youre just gonna sit there and not do anything

have you put anything toxic in your body lately any drugs or alcohol
no i mean ive enjoyed a little of the pandemic special
oh nonono that-thats totally fine
doctor you better come to the emergency room
holy shit
another strain of covid or simply more covid-related symptoms a reported 1 in 10 people in park county are experiencing mustaches and nobody seems to know why the mayor has called for help from infectious disease experts and dr anthony fauci arrived at south park hospital today to give his advice
we arent sure why some people are getting a mustache and some arent but we have to do all we can to avoid it becoming fashionable
will our chin diapers keep us safe
yes but we must wear them where the mustache would be we need to wear them over our mouth and nose
are you out of your mind you expect people to wear a diaper over their nose thats disgusting fuck you fauci
citizens are asked to stay indoors and just try and relax and maybe enjoy some of the pandemic special
nooo shit
nice
butters butters
wha
dont worry im going to save you
okay save me from what
guys guys

no we have to get him out of here now we need to take him to build-a-bear
are you nuts
he has to go out and do something normal
stan build-a-bear is currently by appointment only and only a maximum party of four can visit at one time
we cant wait around and wait for people to figure things out okay its not gonna happen they just keep taking everything from him and saying its for his own good but whos to say he cant go out and have a little goddamn fun if we want things to go back to normal then we just gotta go do it
stans right if we want things to go back to normal we have to do it ourselves
theyre just gonna be making more restrictions and more rules and whos gonna fight to go back to the way things were
i sure as hell will
we can make things normal for butters again and make school the way it was
the way it was online in our own rooms
wait what no in a class with real teachers
wait what what normal are you talking about
im talking about normal like back in march what normal are you talking about
im talking about normal like three days ago when everything was awesome
look it doesnt matter we just gotta break the fuck out of here
timmah
the new outbreak in south park is spreading rapidly and as highways into town close and governments consider a full lockdown one question is on everyones mind where is the damn pangolin some speculate the pangolin took its own life while others think that- sorry sorry were getting some breaking news oh god students at south park elementary have broken quarantine and are now out on the loose
the fugitives broke out sometime last night teachers are reporting theres no cause for alarm except that these children have all been exposed to covid and could be running around spreading mustaches right now

dont blame this on us teachers you opened the school and gave us barely enough resources to do our job
everyone is terrified of catching something from these super-spreaders
well i dont know what youre gonna do mayor you took all our funding away you said our equipment was too extreme now if we had some of that stuff back
yeah yeah yeah yeah
tsst-tst-tst-ch-ch-ch

dont forget to get out and vote everybody big election coming up
and since the students broke quarantine all south park residents are now exposed and under complete lockdown for the unforeseeable future
