betsy macintosh
whatta you want
we heard about you through the passages sobriety clinic they said youve skipped out on your rehab once again
oh gohhhd
we need to speak with you maam
its like these voices in my head wont be quiet until i use again
and so am i correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine
i dont want my baby born addicted to drugs but i cant stop
well maam i have some exciting news we would like your child to play for the crack baby athletic association
the what
we believe that st marys is the best hospital for your child and were prepared to offer it a full ride now do you know yet if your child is male or female or so deformed youll never be able to tell
they said its a boy
just sign the paper and hell be playing ball for st marys
how much will he make
well nothing crack baby players cant make a salary based on the rules
so what you would make money off of my child that doesnt seem fair
i dont make the rules maam i just think them up and write them down now if youll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the-
caint you change the rules
rgh maam the crack baby athletic association is a storied franchise it was founded over twelve days ago with a firm ethical code that strictly states "benefits to players is detrimentalized to their well-being" i cannot offer you or your child any cash i can however offer you a little bit of crack butters
dude what actually makes total sense about it if you look at it is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need yeah its pretty cool dude because most of these babies would normally not even get out you know huh or be able to do anything just because we are making money doesnt mean that those babies arent benefiting it isnt exploiting them theyre finding a useful place in society whats so unethical about that
you sound like cartmam
ooogh dude the thing is were not the ones that made them crack babies thats their moms goddamned fault
yeah im sure thats what cartman would say too
i do not sound like cartman goddamnit okay so see ya
its the easiest thing in the world how could you guys have screwed this up all i asked you to do was to get slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at cedars-sinai ncu
were just having a hard time finding him
slash is not hard to find hell show up to play anywhere if you pay him he played at my eighth birthday party for christs sake look look hes playing at lakewood mall right now now you guys get down there- oh crap the president of ea sports is calling just go go mr peters how are you yes sir were very excited about our deal with you as well oh we know the video game version of crack baby basketball will be a big hit too hey kyle have a seat
i need to talk to you
mr peters can i call you back our company accountant needs me yes he is jewish okay thanks mr peters bye hows it goin man
in our deal with ea sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names but we arent paying the crack babies
they cant make money its against the rules
but this video game can make a million dollars we have to give the crack babies a piece of that
kyle it says right there rule number 3 crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing
gut theyre the ones risking injury
what do you want me to do kyle find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules
the government could come after us cartman
were a non-profit company kyle
so then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an internet ad to payless shoe source go
egh to things we need to keep the office running kyle here look
a hot tub
its not just a hot tub taste it go ahead taste it
gravy
kentucky fried chicken gravy
no way
a hot tub full of kfc gravy kyle did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime kyle as owners of this company we owe it not only to ourselves but to the crack babies to be as stress-free and clear-headed as possible mcdonalds french fries and kfc gravy the french call this "poutine"
i know but dude we cant license our games to ea sports and pay the crack babies nothing slavery is illegal
its not illegal kyle tell you what ill do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it
what other companies
dean howland a representative from another prestigious institution is here to see you
a what send him in
helloo thear the name is eric p cartman im a well-respected owner in the slave trade
in the what
my peaches what a wonderful office you got yourself heah certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness dont ye well let me get right down to it theyen like yourself i am also in the slave trade but at the moment i find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues was wonderin if you could share some secrets
i have no idea what youre talkin about
you have some might strong-lookin workers heah sahr id be willin to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks
are you referring to our student athletes
student atholetes hoho that is brilliant sahr now when we sell their likeness for video games how do we get around payin for our slaves uh- "student atheletes" then
look there are good reasons why our student athletes cannot be paid young man
i aint arguin if they got paid then how did we make all owr money right
we do not own slaves and we have no desire to own slaves
but of course you own slaves because oh riiight of couse you dont have desire to own slaves son neither do i and if there was any government agency listenin in on this heah conversation they should know that weer not talkin bout slave ownership gaauu alright so now how do you get around not paying your slaves
get out this is a prestigious university and i am not saying one more word to you
you think you can do whatever you want cause your corporation is a university this country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldnt hog all the slaves while the rest of us wallow in poverteh screw you sahr im goin home
heres the thing whether or not im a part of it crack baby basketball is popular somebodys going to do it so the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it so that i can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies oh its sooo easy for you isnt it i mean what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today or what you want to watch on tv tomorrow well sorry skippy but the world isnt always black and white just because some people are born poorer than others doesnt mean i cant enjoy a few mcdonalds french fries in a hot tub of gravy from kentucky fried chicken
mcdonalds french fries in a hot tub of kfc gravy
it happens to be called poutine in montreal
how hard can it be clyde you walk up to slash when hes playing at the mall and you offer him a deal
we must have just missed him he was playing at cherry creek mall and then flat irons mall now we dont know where to go because slash is playing the pavilion in colorado springs in the gigadome in moscow later this afternoon
how can slash be playing in colorado springs and moscow at the same time
we dont know hes everywhere
look you morons slash clearly has a fan club right so just go to the post office and find out where the mail gets in and then youll have slashs home address
oh thats a good idea
yeah its a good idea now go get us slash for halftime jesus christ are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company kyle goddamn
alright cartman ive been doin a lot of thinking about how the companys gonna spend the money we make off the ea sports deal were going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies
what
ive designed it to be the best place for them to live a place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve and if you think its a bad idea i really dont care
oh my god its genius kyle
what
this the answer to our problems a three hundred thousand dollar building but we buy ourselves a million dollars worth of goodwill with the public we can say we gave our "student athletes" a place to live and grow for a few years its like moral teflon i knew we needed a jew in this company kyle great work
let me get this straight you kids want me to tell you where slash lives
please sir its very important
well im afraid i cant do that kids
but we have a big deal with ea sports that depends on it
come on kids write to slash every day but it all just goes into this big pile over here the reason i cant tell you where slash lives is because he dont live nowhere dont you ever wonder how slash can be aaall those places at the same time its because hes made up he-
dont spoil it for the kids marty its up to parents to tell their children slash aint real
hullo
dad is slash real or make-believe
ohh dear clydes asking about slash
oooo well the day had to come
clyde the truth is slash isnt a person hes more like a feeling in your heart you know
slash isnt real
get out of here
clyde sometimes people like to pretend with make-believe characters hes not really a lie hes like ahh
er hes like love people all over the world dress up like slash and have different names for slash the dutch call him vunter slash
hes made up and people dress like him and pretend to be him to their kids
your mothers dutch you know clyde ha- how did that old folk song go honey
vunter slash kapunshka
shpielerin manshunshka
and so thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with ea sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies did you see the blueprints the babies will have their own putt putt golf course why does it matter how much im making stan if the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop why does my salary matter
you guys you guuys weve got some bad news slash isnt real
what
slash isnt real hes a made-up person that represents care and giving and people dress up like him and lie to their kids
slash is make-believe
here look for yourself hes based on the fable of a dutch saint named vunter slash
vunter slash
what
but then who played at my eighth birthday party
one of our parents
but then who was the guitar player for guns n roses
one of our parents
are you fucking serious
you guys are ten years old and you just figured out that slash isnt real oh my god
you knew about this
my parents told me slash wasnt real when i was five jehesus christ
well what the heck do we do now
look lets just get our money from ea sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all
boys i want to thank you for bringin the cb double a franchise here to ea sports youve made us a lohhht of monih
wait a minute according to this you now own all the rights to crack baby basketball and we got nothing
yes our lawyers are damn good but you didnt get nothin why you boys got experience didntcha you got a chance to play in the big leagues sure we here at ea might have made all the monih but you little workers had a chance to make somein of yourselves id give you some free video games but its against the rules
you cant do this we were gonna build an orphanage so the crack babies have somewhere to go
oh well fuck em and fuck you too i piss in your faces
i just cant believe slash isnt real
i know its messin with my head so hard
you guys weve just been screwed over and lied to
i know right i was always extra good before my birthday too because i was told slash would come and play for me
well boys this has been real educational and all but now lets part with that old ea sports sayin "get the fuck out of my buildin"
its unbelievable stan ea sports just used us the entire time we worked for nothing and ea made all the money you know i dont think we actually deserved getting screwed over but but i guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems i know i know right we mightve got screwed but the really tragic thing is that those those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there with nowhere to go no way this is it
its what
this is it stan its just like i designed it theres the miniature gold course over there and slides and uh excuse me what is this place
isnt it wonderful all the crack babies will have a home now
but who paid for all this
kyle kyle look
you dont think that- but he isnt real
maybe or maybe we havent been told such a big fib after all
vunter slash kapunshka shpielerin manshunshka het mine gaset rosa danka vunter slasha
he is real you guys
vunter slash kapunshka shpielerin manshunshka het mine gaset rosa-
