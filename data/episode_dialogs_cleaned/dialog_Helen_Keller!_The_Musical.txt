i didnt do anything to you timmy saw the turkey and wanted to get it what do you want me to say to him
you say "no timmy you cant have that turkey bad timmy"
look i know it isnt exactly what we wanted but maybe we can train it
hes not gonna work kyle the whole point was to make our play better than the kindergartners
yeah that turkey sucks
wait whats that you say a thanksgiving turkey is what you require i know of a turkey

tonight we present the story of a courageous girl and her fight against depression
op-pression
oppression our play begins in a simpler time alabama in the late 1800s
1800s alabama what a great place and timewere so happy that we live in 1800s alabama cause its sunny and there is no crime
now to the refrain
and in this little town in 1800s alabama theres a family by the name of kellertheir daughters deaf and mute and blind as a bat and her parents cant even tell her
excuse me i am lamond the animal trainer
oh cool hes here
awesome do you have a turkey that can do tricks
ap ap do not call them tricks shes a very sensitive turkey she performs feats not tricks ladies and gentlemen may i present the most beautiful bird in america four-time prize winner of the national western stock show and reigning poster child of turkeyloverscom i give you alinicia
yeh
wow
whoa
her feathers are beautiful
thats the prettiest turkey i ever saw
of course she is
okay now we can really get this thing underway places everybody where the hell is timmy
tim-mih
what is that
uh thats gobbles the physically challenged turkey
gobbles gobbles
timmy we already got a turkey
yeah and its from broadway
gobbles
no timmy that handicapped turkey does not go in our play
dude dont forget timmy is the only kid who can play helen keller dont piss him off
no thats right only timmy knows the part
tim-mih
oh jesus okay fine helen keller can have two pet turkeys
my turkey does not work with other turkeys
oh god-damnit now what are we gonna do
alright ah ah alright alri- ah a-alright alright
dude we need your turkey for our play
shes not coming out shes very upset shes pooped all over the room
i know i know but listen uh let me try to explain the position im in here the retarded turkey belongs to our friend timmy and timmys the only person who knows the part of helen keller so so tell me what i can do here to make everybody happy
kill the other turkey
i cant dude timmy has a boner for it
well it could meet with "an unfortunate accident"
unfortunate accident you mean like geena davis getting her own tv show oh
its very simple either that turkey meets with an unfortunate accident or you dont have a feat-performing turkey for your helen keller thanksgiving musical
alright alright just get your turkey to stop crapping all over the dressing room and come out for rehearsal ill take care of everything
water helen it has a name oh why cant you understand
dehh haaa
water helen water
shes never gonna do it theres no way shell ever do it
helen helen water helen
how can she talk if she cant hear this is absolutely pointless
okay uh hold it uh lets hold it right there a second okay i just want to adjust the blocking real quick hm-lets see uh why dont we have turkey #2 stand just a little bit more over here lets see maybe a little more up in here and just a wee bit over here and right about hmere there we go good
oh my god theyve killed kenny
whoa-aaaa
aw crap i mustve rigged the wrong light
let him rest in peace let him rest why must he die
theyve got special effects
what butters
the kindergartners theyve got amazing stage effects pyrotechnics and what have yous why its a regular feast for the eyes
oh no
were never gonna outdo them now
but what are we gonna do
calm down calm down we can have special effects too now i know a lot is going wrong but weve got to stick together to make this play work all of us
—and into your hands uh he buh
gobbles hu-ugh gobbles
little boy
timmy
yes tim i feel i must speak with you the others well they dont want you to know but oh i dont know what to do should i tell you
t-timmih
i feel im the only one who can be honest with you the animal shelter is on its way totake your turkey away from you
gobbles
you see they dont allow children in your situation to have wild animals as pets you cant take him running you cant take care of him they have to take it away
gobbles
they take wild pets away from people like you and hand them over for experiments and theyre shocked dissected and flayed while theyre still alive and no matter where you go the shelter people will find you the only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to let him go back into the wild oh no here they come now quick go and set your turkey free ill try to stall them
t-tim-mih
eh excuse me were here to install the water effects for the musical
uh the stage is right through there
thanks
alright got to write the new lyrics lemme see no no no god-damnit
how is it going eric
terrible i cant write the lyrics for the third act nothings coming to me
well you know in theater sometimes we try different tricks to get the creative juices flowing
like what
lets see helen keller was blind and deaf perhaps you should see what it is like deprive yourself of your senses and see what plays inside your mind here
hey thats not a bad idea
just relax just try to let your mind wander and let the juices flow
oh man
well did you see anything
no just the same old crap i always see when i close my eyes
oh thats too bad
wait ive got it the perfect setup for when helen kellers pet turkey jumps through the hoop of fire yes yes i have it now
the only way for that turkey to avoid years of torture is for you to let him go let him go let him go
gobbles gobbles gobbles gobbles timmih timmih gobbles
