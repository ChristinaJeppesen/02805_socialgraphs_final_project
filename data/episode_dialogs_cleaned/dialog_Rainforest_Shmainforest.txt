uh thank you mr garrison how are we all doing today i cant hear you i said how are we all doing
eric cartman you say ‘’excuse me”
okay
go ahead
children we are a national choir called "getting gay with kids" were gonna do a big tour down in central america to help save the rainforest and you can be a part of it
(that sounds fucking screwed)
kenny mccormick you speak when youre spoken to go ahead
you see we take kids from all over the country and put them in a choir where we sing and dance to raise awareness about our vanishing rainforest
did you know over 10000 acres of rainforest are bulldozed every year
thats right and over 30% of the worlds oxygen is made in the rainforest
so who wants to join the fun
what if you dont have any rhythm
excuse me
well like my friend kyle hes jewish so he doesnt have any rhythm
shut up fatass
choirs suck
kyle broflovski you watch your language eric cartman you be nice to people stan marsh you mind your manners kenny mccormick you pay attention go ahead
well uh thats all really so if anyone is interested in seeing the rainforest and joining our choir ill leave information packets up front
oh thats good we need some more toilet paper
