im so high right now i have no idea whats goin on
welcome home smart towel rg-400
ah hi is this where our okama gamesphere is
were missing out on some quality video game time right now
thank you for bringing him to us boys you see this is not an ordinary towel he is the rg-400 smart towel designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth
we dont care
you see here at tynacorp our goal was to make the perfect towel a towel that would sense how wet or dry the users skin was and fluff itself accordingly
dude we dont care
towelie was our greatest success smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills but then one day towelie got high and just sort of wandered off
we dont care
all we wanna know is who has our okama gamesphere
ah yes your video game im afraid that what we all experienced was a trap they called you and said to bring the towel and then they called us and said they were bringing towelie back their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop
whos they
why the military you see after towelie got high and wandered off from here the military got a hold of him they wanted to turn towelie into a weapon of mass destruction
dont care dont care dont care
towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his tna but then one day towelie got high and just sort of wandered off again
goddamnit can we please just get back to playing our video game please
im afraid not because your okama gamesphere is at "their" base
can you tell us where "that" is please
you mean to go right into their base of course the entry code should still be in towelies memory banks you could sneak him in there and recover his tna great plan
sir sergeant masters and boll are reporting sir
ah yes tell me marine did you accomplish your primary goal
sir yes sir all towels have been destroyed the smart towel is no doubt eliminated
ahh and youre quite sure of this
eh yes sir there isnt a towel left within a hundred miles
hmm so perhaps then you can explain to me why we just got footage of the towel returning to tynacorp
oo we
he must have outsmarted us sir
well im through playing hide and seek weve got no other choice prepare to blow up all of colorado
in a moment we will be over the base this is the only way in any attempts on the ground would be easily spotted by guard posts
okay
i hate to send you back in there towelie but only you have their security system in your memory banks
thats alright its always good to bring a towel
good luck boys the fate of the world is depending on you
were not doing it for the world were doing it for our video game god are you deaf
alright boys when you drop from the plane cover and roll got it
yeah
go go go go
dude i figured it out
what
if we can go in and get the gamesphere in 30 minutes we could still be back at your house playing video games by midnight
so thatd be like what eight hours we could play before school
seven and a half
hurry up stupid parachute
alright i think we go over there
lets see no
come on towelie the guy said you have the security system in your memory banks
hey its been a long time
you just have no long-term memory cause you get high all the time
dont preach to me fatso
i can preach to you all i want cause youre stupid
youre stupid
yeah and youre a towel
youre a towel just let me get high i know i can remember if i get high
oh god damnit alright fine heres your stupid lighter
hold on wait a second thats it
thats it
yeah thats the melody to "funky town" wont ya take me down to funky town
no towelie the entry code
for what
god-damnit i guess were gonna have to climb the stupid fence
well lets look in here
kill me kill me
oh my god no-o-o-o
well well well look what the cat dragged in
what are these things
genetic copies we tried to make with your tna they didnt work too well im afraid
kill me
do you have our okama gamesphere
you did very well to get the towel this far boys i wonder what did they tell you at tynacorp that the big bad government wanted to genetically engineer a towelie as a weapon now let me tell you the real story
oh god dont care dont care
yes weve been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel but only because we had to you see when we started spying on tynacorp we discovered a certain terrifying secret
go on ask him what terrifying secret
what terrifying secret
that tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world
were never gonna play our okama gamesphere again are we
dont you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of you get out of the shower and dry yourself off but even after youre dry the towel makes you more dry it keeps getting you drier and drier can you imagine it what it would feel like to be way way too dry ill tell you something you dont want to know and i dont know
and we dont care
youve been double-crossed by tynacorp kids they set this all up to get you in here and take us down
so let me get this straight our okama gamesphere is back at tynacorp
oh yes it has been all along
can i kill the towel now sir
go ahead
no wait perhaps now we can use their own towel against them these boys must return to tynacorp and we will launch a sneak attack on tynacorp as well you boys can take the towel to tynacorps central core and upload this encryption disk into their system bringing them down once and for all
but we dont care
what the hell is this the towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence
the towel has a will of its own its learning compassion
we dont have the manpower to hold off the entire military and stop those wonderboys from getting to the core
then we have no choice well have to test the new prototype a little earlier
dont forget to bring a towel
alright boys take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished then upload this encryption disk into their computers
were just going in to get our video game back
if anything goes wrong use this newly-developed photon rifle
photon rifle whatever
hello hello anybody here
welcome to the party boys haaarrrhhhh
oooh ooohh oh boy
haaarrrhhhh
so you thought you could outsmart us did you kids
aaaaarrrr move move move move move move dont make a move you bastards
bring the towel here boys they cant shoot children
dont listen to them they lied to you before
oh yes boys obey your government well perhaps its time these boys knew what was really gong on
ohmigod look
our gamesphere
aw sweet it still saved our plays
you see boys im afraid you were double-crossed if they were the military why wouldnt they just attack us to begin with because theyre not the military
alright maybe we lied to you but it was to protect your own skin we are a resistance group pretending to be the military to bring tynacorp down
whoa check it out guys the parachute level
sweet
but perhaps we should show these kids who tynacorp really is made up of go on tell them why youve been making towels zytar
oh theres gold get the gold kenny
our planet was dying we had no choice but to find a new one manufacturing smart towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived
and now you know the horrible truth boys
truth or no your alien-murdering group is over
could you turn it up
boys try to reach the core override weve got no choice but to try to take them all out i think i can get it from here boys
what are you doing youll kill us all
sorry zytar didnt your mom ever tell you dont mess with earthlings
oooww
