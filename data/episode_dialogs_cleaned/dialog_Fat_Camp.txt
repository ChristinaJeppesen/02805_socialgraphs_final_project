a little boy who overcame the odds lets hear it for eric cartman well our second guest tonight is a young man named kenny mccormick who is going to eat dog crap kenny
god-damnit all i got was a little golf clap
thanks for coming on the show kenny

do it again
hey kid ill give you 20 bucks to eat a really old piece of bacon
this is ridiculous
so kenny how did you discover that you had this talent
we thought of it jesus i mean kennys the one that does it all but we were the masterminds of the whole thing
i cant say i approve of this my children
huh why not
because kenny is only doing things that anybody could do for money hes a prostitute
ill pay him 50 bucks to eat someone elses vomit
yeah
yeah go for it
whats a prostitute
i dont know
hello there children
hey chef
chef whats a prostitute
dag-nabbit children how come every time you come in here you gotta be askin me questions that i shouldnt be answering "chef whats the clitoris" "whats a lesbian chef" "how come they call it a rimjob chef" for once cant you just come in here and say "hi chef nice day isnt it"
hi chef nice day isnt it
it sure is thank you
chef whats a prostitute
uh uh you children are gonna get me in trouble with the principal again
lunchtime im starved
oh my god eric
thats me
chef was just about to tell us what a prostitute is
why do you need to know what a prostitute is anyway
because jesus told us that kennys a prostitute is he
(yeah am i)
well no uh of course kenny is not a prostitute
why
well because children a prostitute is someone who you could pay for certain services
like what
like keeping you company understand
no
you see children sometimes a man needs to be with a woman but sometimes when the lovin is over the woman just wants to talk and talk and talk and talk but a prostitute is someone who would love youno matter who you are or what you look likeyes its true childrenthats not why you pay a prostituteno you dont pay her to stay you pay her to leave afterwardsthats why i pays a lot for prostitutesladies and gentlemen mr james taylor
a prostitute is like any other womanthey all trade somethin for sex and they do it well
