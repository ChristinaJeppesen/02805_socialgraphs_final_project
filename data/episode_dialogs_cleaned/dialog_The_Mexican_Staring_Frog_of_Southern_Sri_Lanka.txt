its comin right for us
--no longer works so now we only kill animals to quote "thin out their numbers" if we dont hunt then these animals will grow too big in number and they wont have enough food so you see we have to kill animals or else theyll die
uhh so roll the tape
here we are at schaefers crossing lookin for some animals

oh
dude my uncle jimbo was in vietnam
hey yeah he and ned do that stupid tv show
and now time for jimbos mysteries of the unexplained
one of our loyal viewers from south park sent us some 8mm film of what he claims to be the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka now as you all know the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze if a person even so much as looks into the frogs eyes they can be paralyzed or even die and this film proves that that frog may very well exist

(yeah its like killing a dead pig and a turkey)
yeah

and were back in five four three
remember big big big
if youre just joining us weve been listening to michelles incredible story of survival go on michelle

her no-good husband shes got to lose that zero and get herself a hero
but--
he wants to have his cake and eat it too hes got to dump that trash girlfriend
its all about respect youve gotta have respect for yourself
uuh-i think weve somewhat missed the point here lets go to somebody else

its genius it really is hell i even want to watch them hunt the mexican staring frog unless
unless what
unless we can prove to the city world that the whole thing is a sham if we prove that the mexican staring frog of southern sri lanka is just somethingmade up by jimbo and ned we can have them taken off the air perhaps even killed
look why dont we just stick to our own show people will watch again
