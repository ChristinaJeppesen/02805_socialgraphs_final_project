oh no you dont shes my bitch
eh who are you
im bob but my friends call me "ugly bob" because i have the features of a deformed burn victim
really i thought all canadians looked alike let me see
well im sorry guy you know i could cure that face of yours
you can
sure i just need a favor there is a canadian football game tomorrow the ottawa roughriders vs the vancouver roughriders it is at that game that i will officially turn the canadian flag over to my iranian one
what why
hey dont worry about that take a load off dont worry about it look over here all i need is for celine dion to sing our iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of canada what do you say
did you say "hostile takeover of canada"
no no relax there fella
well scott said to meet him here but hes not showing up
well while were waiting why dont we search for treasure
oh good idea lets search for treasure
what are you idiots doing
were looking for treasure
is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that cant be described
no were searching for treasure
listen i have an inside scoop theres an iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over canada
yes you mean saddam smelly we saw him on the telly
well what are you two gonna do aboat it
what do you mean
its your fault that hes here you brought the iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter
you mean we are to blame
thats right and now you must make amends tomorrow saddam will try to finalize his takeover of canada at the roughriders-roughriders football game it will be your only shot at wiping them all out here take this
what is this
its a bomb you must strap it to yourselves go to the game and sacrifice your lives to take out saddams minions
that plans scary
well you must do it for canada
for canada terrance
for canada phillip
yes terrance and phillip and when the dust is settled canada will be rid of both the iraqis and your immature fart humor
well phillip i am very sad that we have to die for canada
yes this bomb will blow us both to smithereens but we really have no choice only our deaths can bring canada life
thats funny
hey wait a minute that fart gives me pause
why is that
that smelly saddam hussein he uses germ and chemical warfare does he not
yes apparently he does
terrance get the phone book we must call every canadian we can
oh phillip it sounds like you have an idea
i do terrance
and the roughriders are giving the roughriders a run for their money all else aside i must say that the roughriders are simply outmatched by these roughriders and thats going to take us to halftime be sure to stick around for the halftime show saddam and the electric iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers
well i guess its time old friend
yes prepare the alert
hello to my canadian friends everybody relax take a rest lift your feet up those dogs are barking
you may have noticed some changes to your country dont worry about that the changes will continue im here to announce once and for all that canada will now be known as "new baghdad" qoloh qalah
