rob schneider is a wall street executive with everything going for him only problem is hes about to become a carrot
im a carrot
its 24-carrot comedy
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ohh
rob schneider is a carrot rated pg-13
oh for the love of christ i wanna watch fat boy no kenny its not funny
kyle kyle
dont try and stop me stan this is what my grandma wants
look i went and saw that john edward guy hes just a big douche
hes not a douche he talked to my grandma
kyle you cant run your life based on what some douchey psychic said they all just use a technique called "cold reading" theyve used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them
hey whoa now john edward is for real
no hes not
yeah my sister told me he knew our mothers name and when she died
john edward oh yeah i heard he walked up to a guy on the street and said his dead father wanted to say "happy birthday" and it was his birthday
yeah kid how do you explain that
alright look ill show you i just need a volunteer how about you
oh-ho me
okay im gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you okay
okay
okay watch kyle uh its an older man someone very close to you
my father
does this month november hold a special significance
my birthdays in november
right because hes saying "tell her happy birthday"
oh my god
see kyle i just started with something really vague i chose an older man because im betting that based on this womans age her father is most likely dead but if her father wasnt dead i could still say it was some other older man
well then howd you know her birthday was in november
i didnt i just asked her if november meant anything her father could have died in november or thanksgiving could have been really special for them but i go with the birthday and validate it now as if i knew by saying "he wishes you a happy birthday"
what else does he say
okay ill just use an old standard hes saying "the money stop worrying about the money"
oh my god my sister and i have been fighting over his inheritance
thats amazing
no it isnt when a father dies inheritance is usually an issue and money is something everyone worries about
that sounds a little too coincidental
yes theres only one explanation this kid can communicate with the dead
wow
what
do me next i wanna talk to my mother
can you try to reach my grandfather
no wait
you have to tell me if my sisters in a good place
yeah help me out too k

you all come out of there now
at a very young age one young boy learned he had a special gift this is "the other side"
okay listen to me listen very carefully this is a trick that i am doing okay watch all im gonna do is say a name that im gonna pick at random okay they want me to acknowledge pete or peter
yes yes my peter
wow
no stop clapping all i did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response now that i see that theres a lone woman crying my instinct tells me peter was her husband so i say "peter was your husband"
yes yes yes my husband peter
wow
oh wow
stop it i didnt do anything
you knew peter was dead
i didnt start by saying peter is dead i started by saying "they want me to acknowledge peter" that could have meant peter was in the audience or that peter was somebodys friend or peter had died i couldnt be wrong see now i can look at this woman and see that shes fairly young so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died so i can say something like "im getting that peters death was very untimely"
yes it was
wow
amazing
ask peter if he knows my little billy
okay lets back up not literally
in the name of all that is holy we demand this spirit be set free
