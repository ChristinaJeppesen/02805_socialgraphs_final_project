ill do it
hehey fellas im glad you called me there was a pie-eating contest down at the firehouse and i thought we should all go
butters could you take a seat please
wuh well sure
butters we have to have a very difficult conversation
wull what is it
well in the in the months since our friend kenny died youve really stepped up as a friend and "filled the gap" so to speak
well uh its my pleasure i love bein you guys new friend
yes well butters its just not working out
not working out
im afraid were gonna have to let you go as our friend youre just tooo
lame
lame yes
well but ah i can get better
butters you just dont really fit in with us here we think its best for all of us if you look for friendship opportunities elsewhere
but we certainly want to thank you for all your hard work and attempts at being our friend lame as they were
huh but ah i thought we were gettin along great heh ah i thought we were really havin fun together
yes well we werent
please fellas uh dont fire me
were sorry butters our mind is made up
but we certainly wanna thank you for coming by you know the way out right
phew
phew
hm he took that pretty well i think
who cares
all right so lets get started on whos gonna be the new person to take kennys place
the world isnt fair i do everything people ask me to i stand in the lunch line for them i buy tampons at the store for them i go on maury povich with balls on my chin for them and yet nobody accepts me i am an outcast a shadow of a man who can find no companion ship no love from others fine if i am to be an outcast so be it im through doin what others tell me to do and i am sick of this world and the stin- and the stinky people in it from now on i will dedicate my life to bringing chaos to the world that has rejected me i will become the greatest supervillain the world has ever seen where i go destruction will follow
prepare o little town uh prepare for the greatest supervillain youve ever seen professor chaos
butters time for bed
hu-uh okay mom yes uh sleet sleep for now tomorrow the chaos begins
all right we wanna thank everybody for coming this is a great turnout uh as you know our friend kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend now youve all been selected as possible candidates but unfortunately there is only room for one of you so stan and kyle and i will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down until we think weve found the perfect friend are there any questions
what if we dont want to be your friend
clyde okay now the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten and so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped so put on your best friend faces and may the best friend win oh and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee
order twenty-three is up and uh order twenty-four is up
uh waitress a-a-actually i ordered the chicken soup this is minestrone
yeah i had the minestrone over here
i am professor chaos and now this puny world uh will bow down to me
so today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends it was a really fun time we rode all the rides and everyone got along great
i think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was jimmy
well the the reason i think i would make the perfect foreh- friend is that i love telling jokes you know who doesnt like to laugh
tweek now theres an interesting choice tweek has a lot of qualities that i look for in a friend
what if they dont pick me what if they get us all man i mean christ if they can get to the pentagon then they can get to us all man aaaa
i think i deserve to take kennys place the most because ive been hanging around these guys for like five years and i never get to say or do anything
yeah ive only seen that kid in class but he never does anything hes more like a prop
towelie is a tough choice because even though i can see how always having a towel around can come in handy hes just always so high
man i really hope i win because wait what is this again i have no idea whats goin on
we decided to get some one-on-one time with jimmy and ride the log ride the great thing was that because jimmys crippled we got to go to the front of the line that was definitely big points for jimmy you know but but then we got to the ride itself and
hey i-im gonna need some help getting in the log fellas
o shut her down someone needs assistance
oh really thats gonna cost some points
but right now id say if were gonna have a retard for a friend i i have to pick timmy because timmy doesnt tell lame jokes
boy isnt this great fellas are we great pals or what
one thing for sure picking our new friend isnt gonna be easy
kneel kneel before professor chaos
ah the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup i love bringing chaos and thats only the beginning
all right everyone it was a tough decision but based on our time with you all at the amusement park we have whittled our choices down to ten if you receive a rose please stay if you dont get the fudge out kyle will you announce the people we want to stay
tolkien clyde craig timmy
timmih
oh man this is too much pressure
pip jimmy jason towelie luigi
just one more rose left kyle who does it go to
tweek
aaarr
all right the rest of you thanks for coming get the fudge out
i didnt make the cut oh god i didnt make the cut
i didnt even get a chance to have them get to know me
all right congratulations to those of you selected to stay in the end one of you will be the new kenny good luck
good morning butters
it certainly is mother did ya hear about whats been goin on some horrible new supervillain made somebody get the wrong soup order at bennigans
no i didnt hear about that
yeh you didnt
uh dad can i uh can i see the newspaper real quick
why sure butters i was just about to get some breakfast
nothing nothing its the liberal media theyre keeping the stories of my deeds covered up so as not to cause a panic well i guess its time to step it up a notch
okay next
this looks pretty good
yeah its not bad next
timmay
next
okay so now were gonna see how you all work as a friend during classtime your performances will be judged primarily on how you help us cheat and give us answers so good luck everybody
sit down boys
alrighty then
all right children before we get started has anybody seen the eraser for the chalkboard it probably got knocked on the floor somewhere can you all just please look around your desks for it
yes look around for your precious eraser you wont find it that erasers in my back yard buried three feet below the surface of the earth and do you even suspect me no now we shall all see how you all like your dear chalkboard without an eraser and information it just keeps pilin up and pilin up until your minuscule brains can take it no longer
no oh oh well never mind ive got a backup one in the desk okay today children were gonna learn about multiplying times five
so you all think that you can outsmart professor chaos do you
now whenever we multiply a number times five the result is going to end in a zero or a five
ms choksondik
