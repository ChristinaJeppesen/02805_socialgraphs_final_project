all right kids you know what time of year this is thats right its autumn and that means our fundraising for next years summer camp is in full gear is everyone psyched for next years summer camp
yeeaahhh
so far jimmy has raised $16
yeeaahhh
francis has raised $2932 and timmy has raised $206300
timmy
all righty if you guys keep this up well raise the money for summer camp in no time
i wont do it mimsy i wont spend another summer at that stupid camp
dawww we dont like camp boss
we hate camp mimsy the singing the competitions jimmy valmer getting all the chicks
doh yeah and dont forget last year at summer camp you got raped by a shark
shut up mimsyyyy im not gonna spend my summer trapped at that camp with these punch-happy assholes we gotta find a way to put handicar out of business and fast
dah oh boy were gonna wreck timmys business huh boss
shh-shh
hey boys are you excited for camp next year
yes counselor steve we like the tug-of-waaarr
all right well just keep working on those donations
come on mimsy we gotta figure out how were gonna make handicar a thing of the past
doh boy
we are united as brothers because jast as handicar has taken away jobs from honest hard-working cab drivers its also taken food from the mouths of the children of car salesmen
well i dont have any children
who does this handicapped boy think he is hes not even in union
hes taking all our business because people find it more coomvenient
aaand because hes handicapped he can use special access points and parking spaces that kid was born with an unfair advantage
who is this rat
his name is timmy burch and if you dont do something quick youre all gonna be out of work for good
who are you
just someone who doesnt like to see hard workers like yourselves lose their jobs thats all
nobody takes jobs away from us we need to speak to mayor and tell her to shut down this illegitimate business
or maybe we can have the police shut him down
hey i got an idea why dont you guys just make your cars cleaner and nicer and try to be better to your customers so that you can compete with handicars popularity in the marketplace
just ignore my friend hes mentally disabled
aw yeah dont mind me
now listen everybody if youre a sheepherder and theres a snake taking away your sheep what do you do to the snake
offer it last years christmas in rocksummer prizes
no you fucking moron you kill the snake
hey wake up you little scab
tutih tuh-timmih
we got a message for ya from the union
just imagine it mimsy a whole summer to ourselves to do what we want its going to be awesome well well hello gentlemen i understand youve taken care of our little problem
yeah we sure did
lets just say hell be laid up a while
yeah we snuck in his room last night and we broke his legs
oh boy thats great-wait you what
timmy
i am lorde lawdy lawdy lorde
but we broke his legs both of them
let me give you guys a hot news flash if you want to hurt a crippled kid you dont break his fucking legs
how can people be so ineffectual mimsy
duh i dont know boss
these are supposed to be men who care about their occupations
duh maybe if theyre that incompetent we shouldnt be tryin to save their jobs maybe handicar is a kind of economic natural selection where the more diligent workers are weeding out the useless ones drrrrr
shut up mimsyyyy
right here is good thank you i can just use the app to tip you right
timmy
ohohh this is so handy thank you
timmy tiiimmih timmih
hey timmy its your friend from camp nathan
timmih
listen you cant possibly handle all this business youre getting admit it youve got more customers than you can handle
timmih
ive got an amazing idea why dont you let other people drive handicars too think of all the money you could raise for camp if you expand your business
hmmm timmih
im sure you could find a lot of interested drivers
timmy
thats great summer camp here we come now kiss your business goodbye asshole
dah i dont get it boss i thought you hated handicar how come now you wanna work for em
its very simple mimsy im gonna take down handicar by being an employee who sexually harasses the passengers
dahhh sexual harassment boss
its simple if youre a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep you just need to have the snake get sued for sexual misconduct now you find me a female passenger on that app and leave the rest to me
dah oh boy
timmy hello maam handicar at your service climb on in so let me ask you a question would you like to see my dick
sure would you like to see mine
uh oh
mimsy hel- help mimsy and i thought a shark was bad
come on honey it says our handicar is just pulling up
timmy oh hi gerald sheila
stephen what are you doing
you didnt know anyone can be a handicar driver now all you have to do is get your own wheelchair and you can earn a handicap ive had my handicap for about three days now get on in im telling you gerald havin a handicar is a great way to make some money on the side
timmy
timmy
timmy
the world of transportation is really changing gerald
daww gee your idea to have handicar expand really worked boss
scuse me out of my way please i have a handicap
i had a handicap way before you got paid to have one
dahhh you sound like that matthew mcconaughey guy ah "i drove a lincoln way before i got paid to drive one" drrrr
shut up mimsyyy
for the pat eight years tesla has been the leading innovator in the world of automotive transport and now the president and ceo of tesla motorcars elon musk
today i am proud to announce the tesla d the most innovative and efficient world-friendly mode of transportation ever created any questions
yes ahh what about handicar
what about it
well all over the country prople are realzing that using an app to ride-share is even more convenient and eco-friendly than electric cars
how do you intend to compete with this boy genius in colorado
i am so sick of hearing about app-based ride-sharing the future of transportation is the electric cars not wheelchairs
dont worry elon handicar is just a small company
oh sure operating in a few small towns but when they start absorbing the taxi markets bringing taxi sservice to any part of the world driving your kids to and from school delivering both people and things
we cant compete with handicar its just so damned handy
if there is a way to reduce handicars positive publicity then we need to do it now and you you say its theoretically possible
of course its very simple if youre a sheepherder and a snake is killing all your sheep how do you get rid of the snake
whos the sheepherder
you are
whos the snake
handicar
dah its an analogy
shut up mimsyyy if youre a sheepherder and a snake is killing your sheep all you have to do is prove to the sheep that the snake is a completely inferior entity
timmy
timmy
hey timmy how is the fundraising for camp going
timmih
thats great i cant wait for camp this year we are doing some fundraising too have you heard of my friend elon musk from tesla
good day to you
timmih
hey how would you like to have a friendly little race it would be great publicity for your fundraising and for ours
dah were gonna get timmy killed in the race huh boss
shut up mimsy
whattaya say timmy a friendly race this saturday well see you at 9am sharp
hey everyone you need to see this
what started as a simple contest is quickly escalating into an international crisis as electronic cars challenge the oil industry and transportation alternatives fight for dominance the unavoidable outcome may be a conflict the likes the world has not seen since the 70s it appears that the world is once again on the brink of wacky races
wacky races holy shit
the prime minister of japan (shinzo abe is shown) insisted that any race would break the treaty of salzburg which called for a cease-fire to the wacky races for their senseless brutality they also claim that if a race does take place they would have no choice but to enter their completely self-driven prototype lexus into the conflict the canadians and chinese are also saying they would be forced to race and no one yet has heard from dick dastardly or muttley unless a miracle happens this saturday morning the world will witness the fist wacky races in nearly 50 years
wacky races oh god wacky races oh my god oh my god wacky races oh my god
randy theyre bringin back wacky races saturday monring
i know are we watching at your house
thats it everyone were out of cereal
no i didnt get any that guy has two
theres none left dont you understand
dont you see what theyre doing this is just another example of corporations trying to keep down people with handicaps
dont do the race you dont have to prove anything
he has to do it dont you see he has people that are depending on him to raise as much money as possible there are hundreds of people with handicaps now
timmih
but isnt that the problem i mean lets face it its not like hes able to keep the driver quality up anyone can have a handicap now i mean even matthew mcconaughey is a handicar driver now for chrits sake
hey i was drivin a handicar way before i got paid to drive one i just like how it feels
look the point is that this is your opportunity to make handicar- oops sorry hold on sorry went too far this is your opportunity to make handicar thee transportation of thte future think what you could do with all that money
and here they are the most daredevil group of shared-ride drivers ever to whirl their wheels in the wacky races competing for the title of the future of transportation cars are approaching the starting line first off is the lyft car a ride-sharing company out of san francisco next up is the zipcar a pay-by-the-hour concept based on chinese bicycles maneuvering for position is the standard taxicab driven by an angry russian right behind is the hummer salesman in his 2014 hummer no class and theres ingenious inventor elon musk in his new tesla d oh and heres the lovely canadian actress neve campbell in the canadian conept vehicle the queef powered completely on female natural gas next we have the handicar with timmy burch and theres the completely automated self-driving car from japan limping along last are those double-dealing do-badders dick dasterdly and his sidekick muttley and away they go on the way out wacky races and this live coverage of the event will be broadcast all morning of course on cnn
jesus its begun
god help them all
all i know is if dastardly and muttley are up to their old tricks theres gonna be a lot of violence today
you are watching bbc world
the vioent conflict over transport is underway and it is even more senseless and vile than many remember we return you now to our live coverage of the wacky races
as the wacky racers roll down the roadway we see that the taxicab in in the lead with handicar pulling up the rear
timmih
all the cars must follow the same route first theyll leave the town of south park then navigate through giggling gulch on the final stretch to pick up the passenger a miss dotty applegate once the passenger is picked up the vehicle must successfully deliver her to the destination point at her daughters house in morrison it looks like the zipcar is trying to vie for position past the hummer vehicle its neck and neck as the wacky racers all push to be first to pick up the passenger miss applegate is waiting patiently and elon musks tesla appears to take the lead
slow down i need timmy to pick up the passenger before we do
but i though we wanted handicar to lose the race
he cant just lose the race he has to get sued and lose the whole business thats why when he picks up the passemger ive got a little surprise waiting for him
dah hey boss it seems like every time you come up with a plan it kind of backfires on ya if you really dont wanna go to summer camp so bad why dont you just tell your parents how you feel you know tell em you dont wanna go and just see how they react wait wait i got it shut up mimsy
hey mimsy
yeah
shut up
the canadian car overtakes the self-driving car and now here comes the zipcar which is being driven by matthew mcconaughey
i was drivin a zipcar way before i got paid to drive one
and look at this the lyft car is the first to arrive and pick up the passenger now the lyft car must take the passenger to her destination but look at this the hummer salesman is running the lyft car off the road and the hummer salesman is taking the passenger to the car and he is gong to let her drive herself
youve got a fully automated sound system and your sunroof is operated right here what do you think huh can you see yourself in one of these puppies
elon musk is using one of his kooky inventions to put the hummer out of commission for good
wow
geez
god
did you see that oh
the passenger is being taken to the tesla d now no way she just got snatched by the pissed off russian in his taxi miss applegate is now in the back of the taxi and shes being forced to watch jimmy fallon uh oh the canadian car has completely run out of queefs with the race neearly over its taxi out in front followed by self-driving car and then pulling up in third is handicar
timmih
its gonna be a close one
not too close boopsie
oh no dick dastardly is up to no-do-goodery again
ohh ohh duuude
oh no ohh
oh no i cant watch
oooo booom
ohohohh

and theres handicar to pick miss applegate up
thats it handicar has the passenger were almost in range another hundred feet wait a minute what the hell are all those cars holy shit
timmy timmy
aaaaaah
timmy
were near the finish line the race is almost over handicar is in the lead still way out in front of the zipcar driven by matthew mcconaughey
sometimes you gotta go forward by goin backward are we drivin cars or are cars drivin us
dastardly car is racing past both this could be an upset folks
timmih
goodnight you son of a bitch mimsy i told you to put the explosives under timmys seat
dahh you told me to put the explosives under the seat of that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves
not that fake soft-spoken douchebag that everyone loves
oh my it appears that an explosion has opend up a wormhole with matthew mcconaughey inside
mimsy
and theres the finish it looks like handicar has done it
timmih
