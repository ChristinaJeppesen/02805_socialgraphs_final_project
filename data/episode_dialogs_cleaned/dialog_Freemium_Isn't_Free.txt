oh really
yeah and the most unbelievable part its totally free you should download it to your phone right now i mean come on if its free why wouldnt you
cool thanks jimmy well ill check it out
you betcha pal
the terrance & phillip mobile game in this game you are terrance & phillip can you collect all the canadian coins *poot*
thats one coin can you collect more youve collected ten canadian coins congratulations hey youre really good at this guy
what
congratulations kyle
with canada coins you can buy stuff that helps terrance & phillip rebuild canada run around and collect more coins or better yet buy them in bulk how many canadian coins would you like to buy
this is stupid
well its just 49 cents for the cheapest one
you buy 200 canadian coins for 49 cents youre amazing now use that canadough to help rebuild canada click to build a hospital here
yaaay
its still stupid and now i paid 49 cents for it
what are you two boners doing
were playing the terrance & phillip freemium game
i played that thing its fuckin dumb i ended up paying like five bucks
who makes this crap
oh its tewwific thats 200000 more american dollars in just one day
where is the roof on this thing
whats the big idea making a mobile game without our approval
ohh terrance & phillip how are canadas two favorite buddies
what gives you the right to make a stupid terrance & phillip mobile game who do you think you are
oh im only the prince of canada and this happens to be the minister of mobile gaming
we thought you would be pleased with the quality of the mobile game-eh
its the dumbest game ever all you do is collect and spend canadough
ey we know the games not great but who cares its free
but its not free if you charge 40 cents here and 50 cents there then its not free
they see through the charade
uh oh you think so
i think they see through the charade yes
im pretty sure they can hear us too
alright fuck it youve seen through the charade so you might as well know everything charade up allow me to explain the science behind micropay premium gaming for years gaming was simple you pay for the game and you enjoy with mobile apps we now have the ability to make games that are boring and stupid but if you pay for incentives youre rewarded
free"mium" the "mium" is latin for "not really"
its a simple cycle a never-ending loop based on rpgs explore -> collect -> spend -> improve but whereas those just use the concept of xp or experience points weve introduced the idea of micro-paying with money money money money money money money
its what everyone is doing freemium games are whats now and its all just a lot of harmless fun
youre in big trouble stanley can you explain to us how you managed to spend $489 on a mobile app
im sorry i didnt realize i spent that much
you didnt realize what are "canadian coins"
you buy canadian coins so you have canadough
stan just because i make a good living with my music doesnt mean you can go blow it all on canadough
ill pay you back for it okay
how
i dont know ill figure it out jesus christ
can you believe him he knew how much he was spending he knew hed get in trouble but it didnt matter i hate to say it but this is a lot like his grandpa
wull whattaya mean
dads always had a gambling problem hes got total addiction tendencies could he have somehow passed those demons down to stan
well then you certainly have some of those problems too with drinking
i had a problem but i was able to stop now i only drink gluten-free beer and wine but with stan i think theres some darkness inside him that doesnt allow him to stop
and so in conclusion the successful premium game is based on five principles entice the player with a simple game loop use lots of flashing cha-chings and compliments to make the player feel good about themselves train the players to spend your fake currency offer the player a way to spend real currency for your fake currency-
so theyll forget theyre spending money
-and make the game about waiting but let the player pay not to wait its a surefire way to make lots of money
we understand micropaying but cant the game hidden inside the charade it- just at least be fun
no no it has to be just barely fun if the game were too fun then there would be no reason to micropay in order to make it more fun
whats this
your checks of course for ten million american dollars each
so this is- everyone is doing this
ehhhveryone is doing it
its just the way things are going
its the way things are going
well i guess if everyone is just paying forty cents at a time it cant be that bad
hey phillip
ohhh hey guys
you missed school today
yeah i just wasnt feelin the best
did you play the terrance & phillip freemium game all day
well yeah i was sick in bed what else was i gonna do
how much money did you micropay today stan
nothing dude i bought like $10 worth of canadough but check it out i unlocked the stadium in toronto
you spent $10 and eight hours to unlock a stadium
you guys is it that much dumber than video games you play
yes
its just something to kill some time like jimmy said its a cool way to zone out
waitwaitwait jimmy told you about this game
jimmy told me about this game
kenny who told you about this game
(jimmy)
dude what
the
(fuck)
pssst hey kid come over here yeah come on over ch-check this out you looking to have some fun
what do you mean
the terrance & phillip mobile game all the cool kids are usin it
aw i dont know
come on just try it out you can be terrance or phillip or both you can walk around and collect canada cash to build new stuff its the perfect thing if youre bored and honestly the best part about it is its free i mean come on why wouldnt you download it and just try it out
hey uh jimmy can we talk
why sure fellas anyway be sure to check it out kid
dude what are you doing
just hangin out what are you up to
you need to stop recommending that app to people
(yeah)
everyone we know says they heard about it from you
i just think its a fabulous app thats all
its not a fabulous app its fuckin stupid
let me ask you something jimmy what happens on level 2 after you get the ontario nugget
alright alright i never played it i stay away from the stuff
you just push it on other people
they pay me to
who jimmy who pays you
youve both done an amazing job new hospitals new neighborhoods all funded by one freemium game
ahh listen ahh weve been talking it over and we really are uncomfortable with this freemium thing
oh ah what is the matter
it seems dishonest and we have a brand to protect
but just look at all the things were getting to build soon canada will be as advanced and developed as michigan
were just worried that some people will abuse the game and start spending more money than they can afford
hoh non well we certainly wouldnt want that oh i have an idea how about we take some of the billions of dollars we are making and we start a campaign to teach everyone to play the game in "moderation"
ohhhhh
do you really think that would help
of course the alcohol industry does it all the time
you friends fun drink hot girls youre hot drink more expensive cars ass drink ass money you in a tuxedo threesomes vodka pussy drink drink drink you drink vegas fun pussy you in a tuxedo fucking this girl vodka drink drink drink drink it all you fucking pussy more tuxedos more cars more pussy more vodka drink drink drink please drink responsibly
come on this way stan i want you to see this there you go thats your grandpa he sits at that slot machine and mindlessly drains money away a little bit at a time sound familiar all the little sounds and lights are calculated to keep him sitting at that stupid machine come on dad were going home
ah go away
do you know what youve done to your grandson youve infected him with your bullshit
what are you talkin about
i just dont understand what is wrong with you two what is the joy that this stuff possibly brings you
its just
its fun
yeah its fun
its not fun you two have demons youre trying to compensate for
well what about you youre havin a glass of wine
im not having a glass of wine im having six its called a tasting and its classy
dad im not addicted i can stop i just like playing it but i dont have to ill prove it
yeah and if he stops ill stop
all right and if you two stop then we wont have a problem anymore hm earthy bold hint of cherry aftertones *uurp*
is it my responsibility what people decide to do with their feh-f-free time i was just a middleman people were going to learn about the game somewhere if not from me im not the one who made it
but you accepted money from the canadian government to push a freemium game on us why would they do that
how do you get people addicted to crack you give it away for free you give away a little taste and then and then some people cant stop themselves
and now stan is so consumed by the shit youve been pushing that he cant even see through it how could you sell out your friend
i needed the money alright i downloaded yum yum sparkly gem forest because it was free i love the sparkly little gems the sounds they made when i got new ones then i made my first in-app purchase before i knew it i had spent my allowance then my birthday money i lost my crutches
you have your crutches
its a figure of speech with crippled people wed say we lost an arm and a leg but they aint worth much
that makes sense
youre saying these games do this on purpose
why do you think freemium games send you those text notifications when you havent played in a while its called a trigger a quick image to trigger the addicts brain they know exactly what theyre doing
hey buddy come on guy come back friend youve got new buddies guy weve just given you 5000 canadian coins enjoy your canadough
free
what is wrong with you stan you said you stopped buying canadough
i didnt think i spent that much i i clicked on a few micropays and it just kinda added up
$26000 do you know how many songs i have to write to make back that much money
one
oh its just nothing to you isnt it
no no its not
you need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way okay
i dont know how you can say that when youre standing here chugging beer
i am not chugging beer im sampling a flight of gluten-free german lagers with a french wine pairing its called a smorgaswein and its elegantly cultural
okay i need help there is something different about me you guys i know the game is stupid and it actually isnt even fun anymore i dont understand
fellas can i have a moment with stan please
sure come on guys
this is my fault stan i should have never told you the game was fuh fufuh fan-fantastic
its not your fault its something to do with my family its like a curse
i know this stuff is hard to understand trust me i know im an addict too but i got help
how
what all the addiction programs say is true youve gotta reach out to a higher power stan youve gotta get down on your knees and youve gotta say "i have a problem" and youve gotta ask that higher power for help
we have to find a way to get the word out people need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems there has to be a way that we can get to the news company and sneak in and somehow borrow their tv signal if we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous then-
its done
wuh whats done
the word is out "terrance & phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts" i tweeted it its trending
you son of a bitch you paid pushers to get addicts hooked on our freemium game
you what
now hold on terrance & philip theres nothing wrong with promoting a mobile game
but theres something very wrong with knowingly making it appeal to human weaknesses
you didnt build a mobile game you built an addiction machine
minister of mobile gaming whats this all aboot
alright alright youve seen through the charade again let me explain how freemium games really work the truth is a very small percentage of people who download freemium games ever pay anything for them its all aboot finding the heaviest users and extracting the most amount of cash from them thats how you get addicts to pay two hundred bucks for a game thats not even worth forty cents
but then all our profits come from people with problems
dont think aboot that think about all the money here have a bump of coke
okay but we still wont stand for this
i dont know if youre listening but i guess i have something inside me that i cant control something kind of dark please help show me the way
you have summoned the prince of temptation for what purpose
whoa shit uhhh i have addiction demons and i dont understand them
then allow me to explain the darkness of the human soul so you got dopamine right thats the chemical that gets released in your brain whenever you do something pleasurable like eating sex and thats just nature right like rabbits and fish and shit they need dopamine so that they want to consume and reproduce
okay
but because humans have progressed and now have access to all the shit they want whenever they want it its easy for them to overdo and have dopamine problems you know its not fuckin rocket science this stuff
so theres nothing spiritually wrong with me
fuck no its like okay its like being diabetic you know its like you can eat wrong and eat wrong and chemicals get released from your liver in a weird way you know youve been eatin gluten and shit and then eventually youve got a chemical imbalance from your liver and something clicked and now youre diabetic forever right so like if you keep doing something too much eventually theres ummm a dopamine fuckup right and youre kind of screwed up for life
so what does that mean i i can get addicted to everything so i cant enjoy anything
yeah thats pretty much what it means
the addict people said something about me filling a hole
well whos not filling a fuckin hole right you know i mean what kind of bullshit is that so lets talk about genetics now you still have time
yeah no this is great
okay let me get some visual aids gimme juuust a sec
here is a fact 80% of alcohol sales are paid for by alcoholics using slot machine tactics freemium games are able to make millions off of an even smaller percentage of mobile gamers
oh god he just doesnt stop
who is this guy
were building a new canada with micropayments from addicts who cares you think the fucking alcohol industry cares they dont care that 10% are gonna get addicted theyre counting on it its the same with us but weve got our eyes on every addicts screen every button they click we get feedback on how to shove this shit right down their throats
why does he suddenly sound like al pacino in devils advocate
hohon im much worse than the devil im the canadian devil
oh dear god its the canadian devil
beelzeboot
you discovered my plan but too late now the souls of all canadians belong to me
oh no
oh what have i done
heheheh hahaha
so basically the genes you got from your dad make you more likely to have trouble with um dopamine regulation and thats why you need to kind of watch out for addictive stuff okay so we kind of understand now champ
i guess so but why do companies have to put so many addictive things out there
you know they all do it and its kind of my deal i have to put temptation out there too so people have free will and all that shit but you know everyone has their justification and thinks what theyre doing is okay
*ding* ey buddy whered you go dont you want more canadough
whats this
thats what ive been addicted to its a freemium game sending me push notifications
what you just collect coins
how much money can you buy today
no see if somethings addictive because its fun thats one thing but this is just blatant skinner box manipulation wait a minute who put this out
ah canada
oh that son of a bitch hes always doing this shit i tell him "temptation has to be nuanced" but he goes and does this crap again im gonna need to borrow your soul real quick kid is that alright
okay aaaaahhh
oh pass interference interference
stan where are you going
i shall return do not attempt to stop me
told ya kids got demons i dont do that
horror and sadness all over canada tonight when the prince signed the agreement to make a freemium game he apparently made a deal with the canadian devil
hey guy im the canadian devil
the canadian devil now has complete control of the soul of every canadian this is a sad day for canada and therefore the world
heh heheheh i stab you
beelzeboot once again you lack any sense of nuance
who the fuck is that
well well my overachieving doppelganger youre no match for canadian satan
return from whence you came
ow watch it guy
sadly a shocking turn of events here as the actual devil has now appeared and seems to be fighting the canadian devil this is certainly a conundrum for canadians everywhere as we try to figure out who to root for for that lets ask the minister of sports in edmonton
well of course the patriotic thing to do would be to root for the canadian devil but then again he is the one who has promised us pain and servitude for a million years
screw that go canada
enough beelzeboot thy end has come
hey dude
hey
y-you alright
yeah yeah i think im gonna be okay
cool
my fellow canadians what we do now as a country will hopefully be a model for others we have all learned a tragic lesson together that though many sins are out there when you get involved with freemium gaming you are making a deal with the canadian devil we will no longer make freemium games and we will no longer make improvements to our country with money taken from addicts canada is back to being an ethical respected shitty tundra
im gonna move here and here and then im gonna roll to kill this zombie
well okay good idea
what are you gaywads doin
were playing board games so that grandpa avoids the casino and i avoid freemium apps
well all right good for you guys tell you what ill join you board games go good with a glass of wine
thats not a glass thats a trophy that you won for drinking
its not drinking its called a white zinfandel sipping sprint and its competitive get off your high fuckin horse
your turn grandpa if you roll a five or a six you can kill these zombies
you guys wanna put some money on it
