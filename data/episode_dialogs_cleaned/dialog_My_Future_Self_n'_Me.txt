here it is it has to be something eh wait whats this this expires in two thousand two why would he have this in his wallet

butters part of being on an adventure is you go places youre not supposed to go
oh well youre good at adventurin huh stan
what the hell is going on here
it should take about a month to achieve the results you want well mr and mrs brooks i think youre going to be very pleased with the results
we sure hope so we just dont know how to talk to our son about drugs
well now you wont have to ah here he is this is josh casher hell be playing the role of your future son
nice to meet you "mom and dad"
my goodness he does look a little like kevin
yes and he knows all your family history and every detail of your house and hes worked up quite a future for your son
im going to tell him that i dropped out of school and went to prison for eight years where i was sodomized in the ass
woohoo that should get kevin to stay clear of drugs
heh it sure should heh
alright so well put the fake news report out on tuesday night make sure your son is watching the channel 4 news
oh and thats when uh youll fake the electrical storm as well
motivation corp takes care of everything just follow these simple scripts when your actor arrives
"listen to me you crazy person theres no way you can be from the future" oh this is going to be fun
i cant believe it its all a scam
yeah i cant believe it
theyve all been lying to us this whole time
this whole time i wonder if my future self knows anything about this hey maybe my future self remembers this happening a-and can shed some light on this subject
butters dont you get it those assholes arent our future selves our parents hired them to make us more motivated
eh but then why did they come back to the past
they didnt come back to the past you dumbass theyre actors
oh oohhhh but thats like theyre lyin
it is lying butters your parents lied to you and my parents lied to me get it
ohhh that makes me angry why if professor chaos were here hed make everyone pay
whos that
you know professor chaos bringer of destruction and disorder
what
follow me back home stan its time i let you in on a horrible s-secret
wait right here stan i warn you you may not like what youre about to see
we have to teach our parents a lesson show them they cant just play with our emotions like that
now you know my terrible secret
youre gay its fine if youre gay butters i dont care
huh naw im professor chaos stan
but we have to teach our parents a lesson butters were running away help me find the perfect place to run away to
mm uhm maybe i used a little too much silver
how about this winter park it looks kinda nice
no we gotta run away somewhere warm
wow look at this stan "are you sick of your parents do you want revenge for something theyve done to you call the parental revenge center of western america for a free con-sul-ta-tion results guaranteed"
dude i didnt know there was such a thing
hey look somebody lost their cat
uh hi is this the parental revenge center of western america ah im really pissed off at my parents and i wanna impose swift and horrible revenge upon them
look you can make your wiener bigger in just three weeks
oh really oh okay uh where are you located please great uumm can i come by tomorrow
this ladyll massage your wiener for ninety-five dollars well thats a pretty good deal
eleven oclock is great thank you that was easy i just have to go to their office and theyll help me figure out how to get back at my parents
hah-hey i wanna get revenge on my douchebag parents too
fine then you can come with me
hooray and then we can make our wieners bigger and have the lady massage them
i guess this is it
uh hello were here about the revenge on our parents
yes come in please
cartman
oh stan butters i didnt know it was you guys
what the hell are you doing here
im running a business stan are you my eleven oclock
youre the parental revenge center of western america
god-damnit i knew this was too good to be true come on butters lets go
eh so you dont want to make your parents suffer and pay for mistreating you then look ah i dont know what your parents did to you but if youre here i take it they pissed you off pretty good maybe you should at least hear what i have to offer
oh sorry i thought this was a legitimate business
that it is i assure you i started this business over three months ago from the ground up ive been helping children get back at their parents ever since
how many parents have you exacted revenge upon
craigs a-and clydes oh and and kyles but that was a freebie look i run a legitimate business here with state-of-the-art computers charts and technology look around you i know how it feels to be really really pissed off at your parents and i will work hard for you
our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves it was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol
god-damnit see this is exactly why i started this business if a parent cant respect their child than who can they respect huh
yeah
listen parents understand one thing and thats consequences they need to see consequences from their actions or else theyll never learn what my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way
how much is this going to cost us
eighteen thousand dollars how about just three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine ninety five how about five bucks
so everything is working out with your future actor your son seems to be responding
i think hes pretty scared alright
its just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this
well you know what us ultra-liberals say when it comes to children and drugs lies are ok the ends justify the means well take smoking for instance the truth is theres no hard evidence that second-hand smoke can kill but we believe its okay to lie about it as long as it gets people to stop smoking
well that makes sense
so it is with everything here at motivation corp its okay for us to lie and tell kids that all marijuana supports terrorism or that one pill of ecstasy is gonna kill them its not necessarily true but the ends justify the means
well i think when this is all over our son is gonna thank us
okay butters lets start with you i think ive found a great way to get revenge on your parents just tell me if im going in the right direction here what were going to do butters is were going to wait for your parents to leave the house and then smear all the walls with poop
hwuhh thatll make them awful sore
now i want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches
poop- poop swatches
poop comes in a lot of varieties butters i wanna find the perfect one tailored to your revenge on your parents
hey thats neato huh stan
now personally i like the baby green but i also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house
wow eh eh you sure are a p-professional eric i dont know which swatch i like best
well y-you know what we could do uh uh butters is go with the baby green in the living room and then maybe a classic brown or even a nut-n-corn crunch in your parents bedroom
well that sounds good
okay well lets do that then that looks nice
hooray
alright now stan for you ive put together a really nice design i feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that so what i wanna to is put a note on your parents door telling them im the counselor from the school
yeah
the note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me right-away back at my office
yeah
your parents will drive all the way out to the school discovering that no meeting is actually taking place
yeah
and while theyre gone were gonna smear all their walls with poop
wow neato
thats not neato that sucks
what
youre gonna smear butters parents walls with poop i thought each revenge was unique and customized
poop-smearing is the hot ticket right now stan and have you seen the poop swatches
dude thats not extreme enough my parents arent gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls i want them to see what they did was wrong i want them to have to admit that they lied to me
okay okay fine i i just i just my first idea thats why we have these consultations okay okay lemme lemme see here uh oh wait oh this is nice how about this uh well lure your parents out of the house and then well kill them uh well cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
dude
extreme enough for you hows wednesday
no thats too extreme
well first its not extreme enough and then its too extreme where do you want it
just forget it cartman you dont know what youre doing
i am a professional suh dont worry butters youre gonna be a hundred percent satisfied
hey future self
yes former self
you know that thing that i kept hidden in the hole in the wall for two years that ive never told anybody about you know the thing that i take out of the shoebox every night before i go to sleep
oh uh
you must know what im talking about
sure uh uh oh man could you all excuse me for a second i think im gonna crap my pants
uh stan dont you think youre upsetting your future self a little
yeah stan dont be so hard on yourself
mom dad i dont think that guy is from the future
oh you you dont
no you know what i think i think this is all an elaborate hoax and i think that whoever is doing it doesnt have very much respect for me see the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them to be honest with them i think the whole future self thing is a lie and lies are never the right way to get your message across
well you know what i think stan
what
i think he is from the future
yeah he must be its like i just feel hes our son you know
right thats mothers intuition you cant argue with that no stan i think the only way youre gonna get rid of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol
right
okay very nice very nice oh wait uh god-damnit felipe the classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents bedroom the living room is supposed to be all baby green poop
¿qué ¿la caca no esta aquí
¡la caca de moreno no es aquí ¡aquí es verde señor ¡es verde ¡arriba arriba
¡sí sí señor
sí gracias ¿y tú ¡carlos ¡carlos no we want a textured effect on the nut-n-corn crunch poop thats why we spackle with the sponge see spackle gently lo marrado gently see marrado
sí marrado
marrado spectacularrr
sí
god its so hard to find good help ah butters like what youre seeing so far
boy it sure is stinky in here
yearh well three hundred gallons of poop isnt gonna smell like a garden butters but i think its coming together real nice
look eh eric ive been thinkin my parents are gonna be awful sore and i dont think-
yes well ive done my job havent i ¡pepite pepite no ¡no come la taco la trabajar
yes well its hard to find work in commercials so i ended up-
oh stan
oh dude hows it goin man ey you wanna go upstairs and play hide and go seek
hide and go seek huh
yeah stan why dont you go upstairs and play with yourself
i dont believe that hes my future self
yeah but we cant be sure so wed better assume he is and never try that first marijuana cigarette huh
no i actually have a way to be sure im going to cut off my hand if he is my future self then his hand will disappear
s-stanley you dont need to do that he-he is your future self
but i have to know for sure
dont be silly stan you dont wanna go through life without one of your hands
maybe its the hand i smoked that first joint with here i go im gonna do it
stan
yes
uh nothing go ahead
randy
aaah
aaahhh
oh my god look what his hand did disappear he is you from the future
oh jesus christ help me
thats weird because i really didnt cut off my hand it was fake
uh look it was fake in the future too
looks like youd better really watch out for marijuana huh stan
well butters i hope you like the work im sure your parents will be plenty pissed off
uh and after my parents get angry uh how do we get the poop off the walls
ooo ah thats a different company oh someones here wed better run out the back pepite carlos ¡vamonos
uh but cartman wait oh christmas
butters
oh stan
butters weve go- oh god it smells in here
yeah well three hundred gallons of poop isnt gonna smell like a garden
butters were running away
we are
our parents are never gonna admit what they did was wrong and theyre never gonna change
what the hell is this
oh my god our house
oh geez ah im gonna get it now
butters do you have an explanation for this
oh not really sir i just uh
wait a minute chris dont you see this might be our fault
what uh- my god youre right linda this is what we get for deceiving our son
huh
butters listen the whole future self thing well it was a dirty fib
we just so desperately wanted you to never try drugs that we used a big scare tactic instead of telling you the truth
we thought the ends justified the means but they dont they just dont son
were sorry baby
get the fuck out of here
stan stan oh okay uh you you might be wondering why butters has a future self too
yes well eh you see son the time matrix pulled in more people from the future
aw stop it you guys i know all about motivation corp all ive been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me
oh well son weve just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are
ive been told a lot of things about pot but ive come to find out a lot of those things arent true so i dont know what to believe
well stan the truth is marijuana probably isnt gonna make you kill people and it most likely isnt gonna fund terrorists but well son pot makes you feel fine with being bored and its when youre bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you arent good at anything
i really really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning
hes right if we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs then theyre never gonna believe anything we tell them
well theres only one person i can blame motivation corp
oh god who smeared crap all over our walls oh jesus it smells oh
you really did a nice job eric
yeah i gotta admit you really came through
thank you i thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby
well here eric i cooked you a huge box of cookies as a present
thanks but you know all this talk about future selves has made me think maybe i should take better care of myself i mean maybe i should think about who im going to become
atta boy eric youve made the right choice
who the hell are you
haha its me cartman you from the future i came back to tell you that this is the day you turn it all around you stop eating junk food and you start studying harder you stay away from drugs and alcohol and you become ceo of your own time-travel company
oh wow really thats so awesome now ill really work to be successful
right on
go have sex with yourself asshole im not that stupid just for that im gonna spend my whole childhood eating what i want and doin drugs when i want whatevuh ill do what i want
no wait oh god-damnit
