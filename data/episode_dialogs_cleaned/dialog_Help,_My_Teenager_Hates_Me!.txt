whyd you call me gay like what the hell do you know you dont even fucking know me
i-i didnt call you gay
they said i couldnt shoot a bb within 10 feet and i just had to say bang bang and you got all salty and said i was gay
i was saying the rule was gay i wasnt talking anything about sexual orientation
bruh
youre right i shouldnt have used that word look—i was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay i had a dog that was gay
oh so im a fucking dog now ill fucking kill you
okay dude… what… do you want me to do
i want you to just leave me alone
okay but you called me… hello hello

yeah that was kinda stupid
im not fucking stupid
i seriously dont know what to do… ive tried being nice ive tried being harsh… and i get nothing from my teenager nothing
(yeah…)
well youre lucky at least your teenager doesnt threaten to kill you
id love him to threaten to do anything id love him to do anything
on the rare occasion that my teenager isnt in the bathroom all he does is talk about his miserable life im like—okay dude ive got problems too but of course teenagers dont care about your problems im like "look buddy i live in a hot dog ok like maybe lets stop bitching and just play airsoft" but you cant say that because then theyre just gonna—
want to kill themselves
yes yes
(so what do we do do we give up airsoft)
no we cant give up on airsoft—im like four hundred dollars into this hobby
and we love it
except for the part about being around teenagers
well apparently a lot of people are in the same situation were in
what do you mean
ive been reading this book—"help my teenager hates me"
wow
yeah…and… it has some interesting ideas it says were basically just dealing with an age difference and we need to try and connect with them
(how)
it says…we should take them camping
camping
bruh…
bruh…
alright guys we got the tents all set up
yeah check em out
(yeah its really beautiful)
theres a lake over there where we can rent kayaks
so what do you guys wanna do
go home
kay yeah we can do that later but first maybe um… lets bond a bit…
okay looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now
im going to the bathroom
okay well you should probably finish up i know you took the lotion in there you really dont need soft hands for camping
leave me alone
come on dude no shit in the world takes that long
hey buddy whats up i thought you were gonna go out and play airsoft today
no… i dont think im gonna go…
oh d-did something happen
you wouldnt understand dad i just cant deal with teenagers
oh well you know they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath the hormones and all that—its been proven theyre literally criminally insane
you know i just —i just wanted to have fun—and shoot my friends i-i just wanted to shoot my friends dad
oh buddy well maybe you could ask the airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers
we did they said they hate the teenagers just as much as anybody but they cant get rid of them and weve got no one else to partner with
well… did you guys ever consider your dads
come on in boys
jesus christ…
how long has this store been here
what do you think this one can shoot a thousand bbs in like five seconds
seems pretty dangerous what if the police thought that gun was real
no its safe see as long as your gun has a red tip and youre white police wont shoot you
oh thats good
how can i uh… help you gentlemen
we need some equipment were gonna try and take out some teenagers
uh… i think thats a somewhat foolhardy plan have you seen the kind of weaponry the teenagers buy its some of the biggest nastiest weapons we sell
yeah well ive got something bigger american express platinum give me one of everything you have
yes sir
we… have completely had it up to here with you
up to here
our friend kyle just wanted to play airsoft and now hes quit because of your attitudes what do you have to say for yourselves
bruh
yeah bruh great thank you i cant… i cant…
guys things have to improve they just have to ive never seen anyone so disrespectful
(and completely insensitive whats going to happen when you grow up you have to learn responsibility)
ive never seen kenny like this ever
fine then just leave cuz we dont want you here
and we dont want you here we just wanna fucking play airsoft without any of you on our team
