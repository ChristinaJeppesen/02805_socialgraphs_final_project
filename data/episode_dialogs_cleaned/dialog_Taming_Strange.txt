hello young people and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life you have braved the trials of childhood and now you are reaching canadian puberty by now youve probably noticed some changes in your body for instance when you fart your dick gets hard other physical changes are happening to your body as well if youre a boy you may notice that your testicles ache or if youre a girl you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange
this is stupid bro i already know all this
lets just give it a chance ike
going through canadian puberty you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well youre saying things like "hey boddy" and "hey guy" because now that youre older youre discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy and someone who you used to call "guy" is quickly becoming your friend but now lets discuss how a man and a woman make love first a man and a woman fall in love then the man farts on the womans strange filling the womans strange with air so that the woman can queef on the mans face and a baby is born the entire process can take up to six months a- its what thats not how a baby is born whats semen well then why did my wife queef on my face she said it was to- well then why would sh- im gonna get to the bottom of this
make me look like an idiot will you
ey you told me you queefed on my face because because thats how babies are born
i was being sarcastic
being sarcastic i just told a million canadian teenages thats how its done
i was angry because you never listen to me because i wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go
fine you want me to go with you to therapy fine
totally embarrassing and degrading she queefed right in my face
well maybe you should spend less time at work making public health films and more time at home
what the fuck is going on
youre fucking stupid kyle

mr mackey so far the school has spent $22000 on the intellilink system and so far its been an unmitigated disaster
well yeah but see the problem is not everyone is not everyone is signed on to it yet
they cant sign on to it because every time they try they make the sprinklers go off
i know that intellilink has had some hiccups uhkay but ive hired a new faculty member whose sole responsibility will be to oversee the intellilink system and make sure it runs smoothly i want you all to meet pat conners
hello everyone
dont "hello" us pat this system that youre responsible for now isnt working out so what the hell are you gonna do about it

oh noo
no see its a $10000 upgrade but it should clean up all of pats mistakes
mr mackey lets be clear intellilink was your idea you should admit it was a bad one and stop being so defensive
well ih its good to be a little defensive around you miles mkay lets lets not forget that your wife died of an "accident" while you were "drinking" on a "hike" "nkay"
hey now listen here-
no now you listen to me intellilink is a great idea and we just need the goddamned gold package we are doublin down

im looking for a boyfriend looking for a boyfriend
will you get out of my living room please hello
have you ever had someone you love queef in your face
what
im sorry im calling everyone in the canadian health care system to find out if theyre pleased with their health care is this ike broflovski
no this is his brother
your brother receives his medication from us so we just wanna be sure hes satisfied with the service
satisfied with- wait a minute what medication
before this meeting continues i should have you be aware that my face has tested positive for queefie sores
ah im sorry but i dont really care i just want to know what medication my little brother has been getting from you and why
people all over the world get their medication from canada
yeah but something is wrong with my brother and it might be your fault
thats impossible the canadian health care system is completely integrated and streamlined with intellilink
you use intellilink oh my god will you check his records please
sure no problem now what is your brothers canadian medicares smartname
i dunno try "strangetamer"
"strangetamer" uh yep there it is ahh yes here we go i see your little brother has a constipation problem and has been taking a daily laxative since last may ah yes im afraid intellilink mixed that up and your brother has been receiving large doses of hormones that were supposed to go to an athlete in the northeast
are you saying that ike has been given regular doses of hormones because of an intellilink screwup
yes thats right
that system is totally screwed up and does nothing but wreak havoc
its fine it works fine just give it some time god you sound like my wife my my wife
that must be it dont you see terry that health care integration system has made you defensive and hostile and your wifes been puttin up with it
and thats why she queefed in my face
ex-cuse me if my little brother has been getting some athletes hormones then who has been getting ikes medication
