thanks a lot fellas well we gotta get down to the training center and start working out word is we have a lot of sssstiff competition this year
well all right well see you on saturday guys
timmy

s-s-six
timmah
s-s-s-ssseven
timmah timmah
s-s-seven
timmah timmah
ni- i can- i cant huff oh man gee whiz timmy it looks like we have some pretty stiff competition this year all of the special athletes seem to be in tip-top condition and i cant even get past seven reps oh well thats it for me timmy im p-p-p-pooped ill see you in the locker room
timmah
hey jimmy g-good luck on saturday
you too francis
hey jimmy
oh he-hey n-nathan
so uh i see you train pretty hard
yeah it sure is tough im training really hard but im not improving fast enough and the special olympics are a week away
weeell uh maybe i can help you out you know there are shortcuts
what kind of shortcuts
you know steroids
s-s-ss-s-s-steroids but arent those illegal
yeah sure but these are new they dont show up in our urine tests
so uh ha-how do they w-w-work
you just take one of these little blue babies three times a day and inject this directly into your bloodstream twice a day before meals
how much would this cost me
uuuh it isnt cheap ive gotta keep vice off my back and secure shipments from overseas
well then maybe ill just use them a-al-little bit you know as a performance
oh whatever you say jimmy my friend whatever you say
you guys you guys i have the best idea ever im gonna be rich
what
dude i was just looking at the special olympics brochure and check this shit out "at the end of the special olympics a grand champion special athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000"
so
so so dude think about it if somebody just pretended to be mentally handicapped they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks
oh no cartman no
its flawless ill act like i have a disability and when the time come to compete ill kick ass against all the handicaps
thats really really terrible dude
terrible whatever you guys brains just cant compute complex plans like mine can itll work youll see
cartman i will not stand by and let you cheat your way to winning the special olympics
why
because
what are you gonna do kyle tell on me then youll be a great big no-good double-faced poopy-pants tattle-tale is that really how you deal with your problems grow up kyle all i have to do is make people think im handicapped and i get a thousand dollars it wont be easy but nothing worth having ever is
daaaarrrr duuuuurrrr i wanna be in the special olympics bulls eye
oh agh ju-just a second
jimmy

you see gentlemen the special olympics championship and my one thousand dollars is just four days away im going to go sign up now
no youre not i read the brochure cartman if youre under eighteen you have to have a parent with you to sign up for the special olympics
what
it says right there "a parent has to be with you to sign up" and youll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible so ha
moooommmm
yes hon
um could i get you to do something for me
whats that hon
um okay this is goin ta sound a little strange um but stick with me um moooommm would you mind coming with me to sign up for the special olympics so i can beat all the handicapped kids and win a thousand dollars
oh n- no sweetie i believe those olympics are just for "special" children
im not special i thought you always said i was special
you are hon but i dont think thats a very good idea
ill split the money with you
im sorry eric the answer is no
all right mom look heres the truth god this is gonna be hard to say i think mom that ive been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past ive sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people god put here on earth for my amusement but now im starting to think that if i could just spend one day in their shoes if i could just see the challenges they face every day maybe i wouldnt be so cold i just want a chance to change help me change

enter
cartman i really really have a problem with what youre doing i object to it morally and i find it grossly offensive
go on kyle
i know that i often have serious moral objections to the things that you do but this time i think you really need to reconsider because if you do this i believe you will go to hell so i feel it is my responsibility as your friend to tell people what youre doing and to put a stop to it
well kyle i understand where youre coming from and i appreciate you being so direct um the thing is you really have kind a warped view on morality because youre jewish now kyle you havent gone to see mel gibsons film the passion of the jew
i didnt come here to talk about the passion cartman
let me finish if you had seen the passion you would know that hell is reserved for the jews and all those who dont accept christ that being the case it is actually me who is worried about your soul
i came here to talk about you
yes and instead you had to break through yourself this is really the beginning of a whole new chapter of your life kyle good luck
come on push it push it yeah nice p-pecs sweet b-biceps
jimmy i thought we were meeting at the doughnut shop
the games are in two days nancy i cant be w-wasting my time
i guess i didnt realize i was a waste of time

they-theyre all just jealous
youre not the boy i fell in love with last week during free period im leaving you
youre not leaving me you try to leave me and ill kill you bitch
you cant treat people like this
i said shut your mouth bitch why did you make me do it huh youre not leavin anybody you just keep your g-goddamned mouth shut and do what youre t-t-t-uh-tol-told

ah screw you hippies
for winning the spirit award eric will receive this gift certificate to shakeys for fifty dollars come on up eric
i could pile at shakeys heck uh drrrr drrrr
hey just what the hell do you think youre doing eric
uhh hehe uh de-duhhhh
you f-f f-faked being handicapped to win i should kick your ass right here you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater
timmah
what
timmah
oh my god you-youre right timmy youre totally right
everyone can i have your attention please im afraid i have to give back my medal the truth is i havent been playing fair either ive been using st-steroids i was willing to do anything to be the best and the steroids made me blind to the people i was hurting a good friend even tried to talk me out of it and i wouldnt listen to him taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the special olympics
because youre taking all the fairness out of the game but i know now that even if you do win on steroids youre really not a winner youre just a p-pussy youre just a big fat p-p-pussy and if you take steroids the only decent thing to do is come forward and say "remove me from the record books because i am a big stinky p-pussy- " "-steroid-taking jackass" thats how i feel about myself and why i must decline this medal and my place in the history books and if youll let me ill be back next year to compete with honor
hey kid good for you for being honest
well guys i guess now you see what i was up to all along i dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the special olympics on purpose so that jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids eh oh yeah we- well you guys are assholes grow up
