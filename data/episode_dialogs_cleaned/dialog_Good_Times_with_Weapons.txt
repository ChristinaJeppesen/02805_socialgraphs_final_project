in our last episode the four ninjas did battle with professor chaos bringer of destruction and doom it was during that great battle that ninja master kenny threw his star into professor chaos eye now the ninjas were in serious trouble because their parents might find out they had weapons if professor chaos told on them while trying to get professor chaos some aid at the veterinarians office the four ninjas ran into craig and his three friends they challenged the four ninjas to fight and the legendary battle of tokutawa began it was during this battle that professor chaos escaped and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with craig and his friends to find professor chaos or else they would all be grounded
butters
butters
here butters
(butters)
butters
butters
butters
butters where the hell are you
its hopeless dude butters must have made it to the hospital by now our parents probably know we were playing with weapons we have to get rid of the evidence
what
dude we have to get rid of our weapons so at least we can try to deny everything
screw that dude i paid twenty bucks for these things
yeah lets just go return them and get our money back
we dont have time for that dude we just have to ditch them now
okay go ahead kyle throw your nunchucks away if you can but you know damn well that your jewish blood wont let you you cant throw away something you paid fifteen bucks for go ahead and try
screw you fatass
mel gibson was right kyle right now the jew in you is screaming "no those cost money get your money back" you know this to be true go ahead prove mel gibson wrong kyle do it
i- i cant do it i cant do it i
its all right kyle well go back to the fair and return them
come on come on little fella atta boy

somebody threw a ninja star in that poor puppys eye
it just makes me sick how some people can treat animals well nothing we can do for it lets put it to sleep shall we here you go pup ive got a sweet dose of murder for you what the blasted hes escaped oh well lets murder one of these other dogs
all right the county fairs still open
can i help you boys
we have come to return the weapons we purchased
uh sorry kids ah i dont give refunds
listen doucher our parents are gonna kill us and you if they found out that we bought these
i thought you told me your parents were dead
you guys you guys
what is it craig
its butters we saw im
where
right on the other side of the fairgrounds hes just wandering around aimlessly
then its not too late
come on ninjas
all right folks our next item up for bids is this lovely 19th century lamp
aw dude crap all our parents are there
butters is right on the other side
we have to get past them
all right looks like i have to use my power of invisibility to get by
you have that power too
i told you bulrog has lots and lots of powers behold this way i can move about the crowd of people undetected here hold this stuff for me
good luck bulrog
now this lamp comes from the estate of edna and james hollinger who lived in upstate wyoming it has a bronze finish and actual gold leaf along the base this is a rare opportunity to own a classic antique the lamp has been appraised by our auction staff at well over two thousand dollars so were gonna start the bidding at three hundred and seventy five do i do i hear three hundred and seventy five kid what the hell do you think youre doin
haba haba habahoaha
butters
what happened to him
oh my god
oh jesus
oh dude we are gonna get it now
all right people we are all extremely upset over whats happened but lets try to speak one at a time
well like the rest of you i am shocked and appalled at what happened i dont know if the parents are to blame or if its the times were living in but something has to change
yeah i agree
this is the worst thing thats happened in this town the worst thing
yeah i mean there were children watching that auction and when that little eight-year-old boy walked up and flashed his penis it was an outrage
what
what
not only that the auction was televised on public access so my little daughter watchin at home saw the penis how am i supposed to explain that to her
this is what happens when the moral fabric of society breaks down
you see the damage youve caused eric cartman what were you thinking
i told you it was a wardrobe malfunction
dude they dont care we knocked butters eye out with weapons
just run with it dude
uh yeah i agree uh- my fragile little eight-year-old mind didnt know how to deal with what i was seeing c-cartman should be punished
yeah
hey fuck you kyle
yeah i c- i cant believe it
yeah i guess parents dont give a crap about violence if theres sex things to worry about
so i guess this means we get to keep our weapons
yeah come on ninjas weve got some more work to do
hya
