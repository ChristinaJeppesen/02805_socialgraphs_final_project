no mr garrison theres something you should know al and i are getting married
married
yes
you cant get married youre faggots
oh jesus christ
mr slave i am legally a woman now if you wanna get married you have to marry me
oh thats not true colorado is about to pass a bill which allows same-sex marriage
were getting married right after the bill passes on saturday
oh thats just great theyre gonna let queers and homos get married huh
okay thats enough out mr garrison
well just see about this you fudge-packin fags ill stop that gay-marriage law
oh my god youre just saying that because youre jealous
jealous of what im doin this out of principle to protect the sanctity of marriage fags are gettin married over my dead body
hello oh hey dude
so what are you and wendy doing
oh were just makin a cradle out of an egg carton for our egg we figure that way itll be easier to keep safe so we can get an a
uh huh
i dont think its gonna be that hard to keep it from breaking this whole assignment is stupid
yeah well so is your hat
stan i need you to watch the egg for a while
i cant im busy
ive been looking after it all day i have to go to the hair salon and the candy store
so take it with you
stan this is our egg were both supposed to take care of it
well maybe i didnt want to have an egg with you okay bebe
well whether you wanted to or not doesnt really matter now were going to get graded together its your egg too own up to your responsibilities
these homosexuals think they can just step all over our traditions well i say marriage is a holy sacrament between a man and a woman
who is that lady
i dont know but she is pissed
they passed this law behind our back we need to tell the governor and the world that gay marriage is not okay that homosexuals cannot muddy our traditions and there is only one way for us all together to make that message very clear we need to round up three or four queers and beat the livin hell out of them come on everybody lets get some queers and some trucks and have us a good old-fashioned fag drag
well uh we were thinkin we would you know just go appeal to the governor
appeal to the governor ohcome on wheres your balls fag drag
we dont "hate" homosexuals we we we just dont want them to be able to marry
yeah we were just thinkin o goin and askin the governor to veto the bill
yeah
eh fah fag drag
governor we have collected over one thousand signatures requesting that you veto this gay-marriage bill
oh jeez i knew this would happen first the gay people come in here wanting equal rights then this bill gets passed and now all the people against it want me to veto it > why do i have to make this decision />
because youre the governor
i just wanted a big house and lots of respect i didnt want this kind of responsibility i mean i dont know anything about gay marriage what argument can i use to deny them their right to a family
well think of the children if you allow gays to get married then youre also givin them full rights as parents to adopt you think kids can be raised by queers
i cant use that argument theres never been a study done which proves that either way
but if you had such a study a scientific study which proved same-sex couples are incapable of raising a child
then i would have something to fall back on so-something to take all the pressure off of me
mr governor i will get you that study
hey wendy hows your egg doing
oh great its a pretty easy project kyles really good with the egg
yeah i wish i had a partner like kyle i went to go pick up the egg from stan yesterday and his dog had it in its mouth our egg isnt gonna last a week with stan around
okay students change of plan youve all been doing a great job taking care of your eggs but now were going to mix it up a little wendy and kyle will no longer be together
ha
lets see what happens when we put two same-sex couples together to take care of an egg shall we kyle you are now with stan and wendy is with bebe
why
come on bebe well take your egg for you and wendy to look after
oh goodie
and well just take this egg for stan and kyle to look out for
no no thats my egg
wendy were doing an experiment here you go boys
but i made that egg mr garrison please youyou cant give my egg to stan hell break it
hoh now what makes you say that wendy im sure two boys can handle an egg just fine and if not well certainly prove a point to that goddamned governor wont we
who
never mind just carry on children just carry on as two reckless little boys will
okay there now we can carry this egg around in this case without it getting cracked
alright give it to me ill take it home tonight
look stan you want me to just take care of this egg
why do you say that
its just that i really need this a stan and bebe did say you almost broke your last egg
thats because i was pissed off
at who heh- hang on
i wanna see my egg
huh
i want to see my egg
wendy it isnt your egg anymore
yes it is i made it i decorated it
well you might have made it but were the ones who are taking care of it now you have your own egg to look out for
i just wanna hold my egg for a couple of minutes
wendy i just wanna get an a okay lets not make this any more confusing than it already is
dont let anything happen to it please
wendy nothings gonna happen to the egg you can have it when the week is over and i have my grade freakin weirdos man
you think youre so great dont you well guess what maybe i dont need your help im taking the egg home tonight and im gonna show everybody tomorrow that im every bit as good an egg-take-care-over as you
what the hell is wrong with everybody
okay children its wednesday time for an official egg check heidi and eric
our egg is fine
okay annie and timmy
timmiih
good millie and clyde i saw yours before class powder and kenny
(our egg is okay)
now how about our gay couples stan and kyle
fine
what
no problems at all
thats impossible are you sure you didnt break it and switch eggs on me wheres my signature
its right there see
two boys cant possibly take care of an egg
dude its totally fine
it isnt fine it has two daddies you call that fine it may be fine on the outside but inside its confused and embarrassed look at the freak egg it has two daddies two daddies two daddies come on class lets rip on the freak egg two daddies two daddies
tom im standing outside the governors office where in just two days the governor can either sign or veto the new bill allowing gay marriage same-sex couples from all over the state have shown up in support while dissenters have also converged the governor is about to give a statement
i believe that i might have come up with a compromise to this whole problem that will make everyone happy people in the gay community want the same rights as married couples but dissenters dont want the word "marriage" corrupted so how about we let gay people get married but call it something else you homosexuals will have all exactly the same rights as married couples but instead of referring to you as "married" you can be butt buddies instead of being "man and wife" youll be butt buddies you wont be "betrothed" youll be butt buddies get it instead of a "bride and groom" youd be butt buddies
we wanna be treated equally
y-you are equal its just that instead of getting "engaged" you would be butt buuuddies and everyone is happy
well what about lesbians
well like anyone cares about fuckin dykes oh god i was sure that would work
damnit damnit stan and kyles egg is still doin fine those little assholes are screwin up my entire plan yes what what the hell is this
i broke the egg
you broke your egg uh but youre partnered with a girl
i tried to cover it up tried to put it back together with modeling glue tried to seal it with a soldering gun but i give up i cant hide it i broke the egg
did you tell anyone else about this
no
did you tell your egg partner heidi
no thats why im here i think you should still give heidi an a on the project you see i broke the egg not her and so i should get an f and she should get an a which means that together the grade should average out to c minus for both of us
i cant do that eric
damnit i knew youd say that you always have it out for me
you have to get an a eric here ill sign this new egg for you well pretend this never happened all right just put on the old hair color in the same eyes there we go good as new go enjoy the rest of your recess
mr garrison youve never been this cool to me before
okay well youre welcome eric now just run along
why are you doing this
because im a nice teacher all right
what do you want from me
