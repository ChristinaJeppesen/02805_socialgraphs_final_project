you mean about keeping your dick out
"capiche" youre associating italian-americans to intimidation tactics youd better watch your micro-aggressions bro
oh-kay look you dont want to end up like the spokesman for subway so you
did you just use a term that excludes women from an occupation
okay lets back up aaah
did you just say "spokesman" instead of "spokesperson" when women are just as capable at selling sandwiches as anyone are you purposely trying to use words that assert your male privilege
no im sorry i was just trying to frame you for raping butters
do you think italian-americans and women are less important
oh god
you dare to use words that alienate two communities of people who have to deal with verbal biases like yours on a daily basis

all right bring him in bro
were ready woo
hey what hey no i- no i dont-
all the pledges take a shot
all right pledgies were excited you wanna try and be pc we hope youve got what it takes to join the most socially active group in america
weoooh
you know theres still some people out there that say "what does being pc really mean" well ill tell you what it means it means you love nothin more than beer workin out and that feelin you get when you rhetorically defend a marginalized community from systems of oppression
wooo yeah dude lets go woowooo yeah
yeah
wooohooo
wooo-ooo
wooohooo lets go yeah
you got home pretty late last night six am
ive joined a social awareness group its a coalition that discourages the use of words that have negative or offensive connotations to grant respect to people who are victims of unfair stereotypes
you got in at six and now youre missing work
weve been getting away with horrible things sharon having- laughs at less privileged people and thinking it was harmless our group is trying to be a civilizing influence where we discuss and have meetings to better define and reinforce tolerance and acceptance of all groups of people
hm and do they have booze at these meetings
uhhhh they serve refreshments yes
cartman
we cant beat him you guys pc principal is too strong
what do we do now
theres nothing left to do im going to admit i did something wrong take my punishment and move on im not tom brady
oh no
dude if we all tell the police what the principal did hell be fired
yeah
no way
why
because pc principal is right kyle you and i are bigots and its time for us to grow up
no youre a bigot
if i can face my prejudice why cant you were two privileged straight white boys who have their laughs about things we never had to deal with
im not going to apologize for saying caitlyn jenner isnt a hero in fact personally i think shes most likely not a very good person
aaahh aahh kyle believe me i know the struggle with hatred lets make ourselves better people together
come on fat-ass
no more fat-shaming kyle lets start a new chapter
so youre never gonna call me a dirty jew again
no im going to call you my friend
oh fuck you
i guess we never realized how bad he really was
all right pledges listen up congratulations on making it to the final cuts
wooohoo yeah
now its time for the final test so what youre gonna have to do to prove you belong with pc is go out there and check someones privilege
finally
yes
im sorry i dont know what that is
topher can you explain "check your privilege" please
uh its getting someone to acknowledge their own inherent privileges and reminding them to put them aside in order to better understand another humans plight
yeah see theres some people out there like brett fucking favre who think that when we all stand up and applaud caitlyn jenner at the espy awards he can get away with one of these bullshit claps its called "clapping" favre what the fuck are you doing washing your hands youre either on board or youre not bro now if hes gonna bring shame on someone then he can have his privilege checked and have a little shame brought down on him
you want me to shame brett favre
no cause theres somebody even worse now
aaaahh what the fuck dude what the fuck
i may be down but im not out tom bradys never out

stan straight white males in a capitalistic society have little- understanding of victimization compared to injustices against the underprivileged dicks on your face is a very first-world problem oh shit
look kyle maybe you should just say caitlyn jenner is a hero
i didnt even say she wasnt a hero i just said she isnt a hero to me i didnt like bruce jenner as a person when he was on the kardashians and i dont suddenly like him now
