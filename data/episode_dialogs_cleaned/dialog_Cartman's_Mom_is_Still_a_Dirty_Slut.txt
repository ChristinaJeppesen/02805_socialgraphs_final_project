whoa dude
what are we gonna do mayor this killer is on the loose
we cant even leave our homes for fear of our childrens safety
uh where are our children
officer barbrady lets pretend for one second that we had a competent law enforcer in this town what would he do
hmmm thats a good question mayor let me get right on that with thinking
mayor mayor
the press is here
my name is sid greenfield im the director from los angeles for americas most wanted
youuu certainly made it up here quickly
were desperate for stories
a-and this one is so compelling
really
sure this story has everything people furniture talking-ih its a real american story
hey i thought of something uh no wait thats subtraction
mr director person what exactly do you want to do
mayor shouldnt we be focusi--
shh
we just want to do a recreation of the story for our show then well flash a number on the screen that people can call if they have any information regarding the identity or location of the shooter thats it you win we win america wins
are you sure this wouldnt make our little town look dangerous
dont worry mayor americas most wanted is not about violence its about family
it is
weelll in that case i guess its okay
great well get started with auditions immediately what part should we cast first
who will the director cast first will it be mr garrison officer barbrady chef
i want to have an abortion
uoh well we can do that this must be a very difficult time for you mrs
cartman yesuh- its such a hard decision but i just dont feel i can raise a child in this screwy world
yes ms cartman if you dont feel fit to raise a child then abortion probably is the answer do you know the actual time of conception
about eight years ago
i sseee so the fetus is
eight years old
ms cartman uh- eight years old is a little late to be considering abortion
really
yes this is what we would refer to as the "fortieth trimester"
but i just dont think im a fit mother
wuh but we prefer to abort babies a little- earlier on in fact theres a law against abortions after the second trimester
well i think you need to keep your laws off of my body
hmmmmm tsk im afraid i cant help you ms cartman if you want to change the law youll have to speak with your congressman
well thats exactly what i intend to do good day
come on children weve gotta find a doctor
ugh i cant do it dude
come on stan hospitals arent all that bad
yeah stop being a wuss
doctor
one moment please nurse i need 20 ccs of sodium pentathol stat

our differences must be set aside for now mr chef im simply a man a man trying to do my job
whoa this is a good movie
come sail away come sail away come sail away with me ladscome sail away come sail away come sail away with me-hee
ohh dude when can we get out of here
doctor i cant focus
were doing the best we can maam theyve closed the pass and none of the other doctors can get through for now its just me and nurse goodly
wait a second theyve closed the pass
yes im afraid were critically understaffed unless we get help soon all these people in here are completely fucked
metaphorically speaking that is
what about mephesto are you taking care of him
hes on full life-support and breathing fine he shouldnt need any help - so long as the power doesnt go out
oof who didnt see that coming a mile away huh
tonight on americas most wanted a shooter is on the loose in colorado and its residents are up in arms heres your host john walsh
good evening and welcome to americas most wanted tonight terror invaded the small mountain community of south park colorado when dr alphonse mephesto was gunned down in his laboratory americas most wanted has reconstructed this heinous crime in hopes that your calls could help solve the case

this is not a world i want to live in doesnt anyone want--
god-dammit
what the hell is this
weve lost the feed to la
uuuhm we-we seem to have lost our linkup to the south park crew sso i guess well be going to our featured movie who framed roger rabbit
who framed roger rabbit was it jimbo mr garrison chef
somebody go see why we lost the hookup
holy smokes that blizzard is getting crazy
dont panic anybody the power lines are down but the backup generator is running just fine
nurse i could use some help in here
coming
lady-m is mephesto gonna be okay
yes for now but im afraid the generator wont run for long the batteries run out in half an hour time is very short
nurse please i need another pair of hands in here
oh sorry
dont you see governor i should have a right to have an abortion if i want one
mmaarr i dont know-uh i might need some more convincing hm-hm-hm
i mean what right do i have bringing another child into this overpopulated world then again i shouldve thought of that before having sex then againuh-- oh i just dont know
please mr chef ive over 100 people to attend to an-and only myself and nurse goodly
what do you want me to do
do you know anything about surgery
i used to watch quincy
what why the hell didnt you say so put on some scrubs boys im making you all honorary doctors you can help us save these peoples lives
no way dude
well were not going anywhere for a loong time
were snowed in
yes were trapped
like sailors on a submarine
my god this is the worst storm ive ever seen
oh i have to get out of here i havent eaten since breakfast
yeah im gettin hungry too
i hope you all realize what we might be facing here
our only option might be to eat each other to stay alive
uuuhh its only been like four hours arent you resorting to cannibalism a little quickly
thats the law of land mr director it aint pretty but if a few of us must die so the rest can stay alive so be it
buut how do we decide "who"
well we draw straws
now wait a minute we all had a big breakfast cant you people go without eating for a little while
calm down soldier we need every person here to keep his head barbrady fetch some straws
well- who the hell made you the boss anyway
who the hell made jimbo boss was it barbrady chef mr gar--
miles appendix has burst i have no choice but to operate now with our limited power i need you all to be strong for me nurse goodly will take care of the anesthesia chef you act as her arms boys you have to help with suction and bandages ready
no
okay first ill make an incision on the chest over the heart
oh boy
bleech
duhuhude you barfed into the incision
sweet
suction
hey whos screwing with the lights
who is screwing with the lights is it barbrady or jimbo or the 1991 denver broncos
that is really starting to piss me off
alright so far everybody has a long piece of straw well keep drawing whew
whew
wooo
wait a minute where the hell is the short one
the short what
dammit barbrady when you draw straws youre supposed to have one of them short thats how you decide who loses
thats not how i played it
uuugh could we hurry this up my stomach is growling
i found a map that shows the location of a backup generator apparently they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency but its out and away from the hospital
so how do we get to it
we must split up into two teams team a and team b team a will consist of myself stan kyle eric chef and nurse goodly team b will consist of kenny
now listen closely team b your goal will be to turn on the backup generator to do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct
meanwhile team a will go to the holding area here where there is a television and some cocoa we will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until team b makes it through the sewage duct by that time team b- remember thats you kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator it will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top and there could be velociraptors- here
once you reach the top you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television then you could proceed down into the generator and power it on are there any questions
nnoh that sounds pretty sweet to me
great then lets do it go team
(huh)
i cant go on eh so hungry
were all going to die in this horrible place
we have to have the energy to make it through the night we have to eat
how can we how could we live with ourselves
theres only one answer eat eric roberts
yes of course nobody gives a shit about eric roberts
eat eric roberts
no no please
well theres no going back now were cannibals god save us
god wants you to live mayor fight
well i have to admit eric roberts was much juicier than i expected
aaww
this snow just isnt letting up were gonna die here i know it
what time is it barbrady
its almost midnight
oh i cant go on
well give the storm another hour after that we might have to eat again
what christ are you people diabetic or something
team b come in team b
(this is team b)
listen team b weve found another path to the generator theres actually a nice heated walkway to it so you dont need to walk through all that sewage
(are you fuckin telling me that i couldve fuckin gone that way)
oh well forget i said that then listen team b you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left
(yup i see it in the drift)
good head towards it team a out
what if mephesto never wakes up and i never find out who my father is
my god what a harrowing tale of human drama this is all of us doing what we must to survive
it is amazing what people can do under stress just look at the pyramids nobody knows how they built those or who
who built the pyramids was it the ] officer barbrady ]
(okay ive reached the generator)
roger team b hes reached the backup generator team b can you see the two copper nodes
(roger)
good now is there a wire connecting them
(negative)
damn the wire connecting the nodes is gone we need to complete the circuit between them or were screwed
dyou have any wire here
theres no time once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die
(ill stick em together)
no kenny you cant there must be some other way hes going to make the connection himself with his hands
no hell die
go kenny
kenny nnnoooooo
(goodbbyyyyee-ugh)
oh my god theyve killed kenny
you bastard
the power
quickly get the scanner running again
weve got a chance now
well okay mrs cartman ill legalize 40th trimester abortions for you
oh thank you thank you
well have the pregnancy terminated immediately
terminated
why yes thats what an abortion is
oh no uh- i didnt mean that i meant the other thing you can do-whats that other a word
adoption
yess thats what i mean adoption
well thats- pretty different
oh i should tell my son the truth about everything myself good day mr president
well we made it the power is on the snow is melting and your friend mephesto is doing fine
where where am i
youre at the hospital mr mephesto you were shot now we dont know who tried to shoot you but--
ohh im sure it was my brother again he tries to shoot me every month
ooohhh
wheres the little fat boy hell be delighted that mephestos awake
he went off looking for mr kenny
he was a good friend and ill miss him
he was very brave he risked his life so that mephesto could live
yeah and now hes a freezy-pop
dude dyou think if we hit him with a shovel hed shatter
i dont know lets find out
ohh its over were free
yes but at what cost mr garrison at what cost
listen everybody we did what we had to in there
but- hhhow will we live with ourselves now
mm-one day at a time mayor mm-one day at a time
ave maria
well im bringing home some eric roberts in a doggie bag does anybody else want some
im glad that you could all come i can finally reveal who the father of eric cartman is but first i want to thank kenny mccormick for sacrificing his life--
just tell us already
alright alright the father of eric cartman is say did anybody see that terrance and phillip special last month wasnt that just the funniest thing--
dammit tell me who my father is already
oh as i said before the father is somebody in this room the father is mrs cartman
what
yes its true
noo that doesnt make sense
yes it took quite a while for me to understand as well you see mrs cartman is a hermaphrodite
uh-meaning what
meaning that she has both male and female genitals
its true
you mean at the drunken barn dance when we all got together with her she was a he
no no not exactly but she did have a penis
the fact of the matter is hermaphrodites cannot bear children so mrs cartmans dna match with eric can only mean that she is his father and she got another woman pregnant at the drunken barn dance
ugh man this is fuckin weak
dude youre a big fatass and your moms a hermapholite
im sorry i never told you eric
i just thought maybe it would be a little shocking to you
oh wow gee whiz you think so mom
well thats that thank you all for playing
no no wait a minute if if shes my dad then whos my mom
who is eric cartmans mother is it mrs crabtree sheila broflovski the mayor
ooohhh forget it
