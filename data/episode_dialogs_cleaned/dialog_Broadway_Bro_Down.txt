i mean look guys i know its just the dolphins but tebow is definitely our quarterback for the future what do you think nelson
i didnt see the game
you didnt see the game what the hell were you doing
took the wife down to denver to see that new musical in town
a musical nelson couldnt watch football cause his wife made him take her to a musical
good for you nelson did you get a blowjob afterwards
sure did
niice
what
i took my girl to see that show last week got the best hummer of my entire life afterwards
forty-five minutes non-stop
nuh uh
its true im taking my wife on saturday bro
noh uh
im telling you randy put your time in with the musical and the rewards afterwards are awesome
must be a pretty hot and steamy show whats it called
wicked
oh wicked
heaven knows we know what goodness iso heaven knows wicked people arent goodfrom head to toe she was just wicked peoplehead to toeshe wasnt good to know what goodness is
hey do you uh do you want some alcohol or somethin sharon
nono im good thanks
okay ill be right back scuse me sorry
can i get a scotch and soda
enjoying the show
oh yeah its not really what i expected
no
to be honest im just here for the blowjob from what i heard i figured the show must be really sexy and hot but i just dont see it happening
oh itll happen dont worry right now your wife is being shot so full of subliminal messages all shell be thinking about afterwards is "blowjob"
subliminal messages
its a musical thing women are so caught up in all the singing and dancing they dont even notice it but theres a blowjob reference almost every ten seconds broadway writers call it "subtext" just listen really really closely
while youll do great here in the emerald city im sure you cant wait to go
take me away to that special place (that blowjob place)where people like us can all live free (free to give blowjobs)take me away and lets live togetherthats the place/blowjobs for you (blowjobs) and me
now lets try defying gravity
look at them becoming friends here in oz you love blowjobs
and new loves cry defying gravity
suddenly dont you love free love blowjobs
oho that was so much fun all the costumes and the sets were amazing i really love the songs that stephen schwartz is a genius ive got them all stuck in my head hey that was such a treat how would you like a little treat
whoa no way
come on larry dude why does this happen every time
do something you stupid vegan
coach feegan the vegan wont jump off the board hey coach
you just dont get it stotch im telling you go see wicked its the best time
how long was it
she started in the car and then it lasted the whole drive home and then she kept going for like another twenty minutes
nice bro
get tickets stotch its worth it
what was the show about
uh shit i dont know some green chick and a goat or something
come on feegan either jump or get off
go go
look i thought broadway musicals werent for me either but i just didnt know about the whole subtext thing you know i couldnt really appreciate em till now
wicked isnt even the best bro youve gotta check out jersey boys it makes women hummer crazy
really
nonono have you see south pacific thats a jaw-breaker
say sharon how would you like to go to new york for the weekend
what randy are you serious
i got plane tickets and a hotel room we leave in three hours
oh my god first you take me to wicked and now this
hey wait dad are you guys really going away what about us
oh dont worry ive taken care of everything youre staying the weekend with the feegans
not the vegans
no dad please dont do this
it takes a lot of guts to be a vegan in todays world you get labeled "soft" or "silly" but the truth is there isnt a need to eat animal products would you ever believe that hot dog was vegan
yes
cancer heart disease drowning all preventable with a vegan diet and a life jacket and if people wanna say us vegans are silly well they can just laugh all they want cause being vegan is more important than being popular
maybe you should let your son decide that for himself
he does decide for himself larrys been a vegan since he was born
maybe if larry had a nice steak once in a while he wouldnt get beat up by every kid in school
you know that when you think you have the flu youre actually experiencing the gastrointestinal effects of contaminated meats or eggs researchers have found that in meat-eating households there is more fecal bacteria in the kitchen sinks than in the toilets
dad dad you have to come back this isnt working out please answer the phone dad dad

oh reginald how about a hummer at halftime a super bowl suckle from me

mr randy marsh
and hold sorry folks were in a hold just freeze right there uhh this better be important
it is i represent some of the biggest names in all of broadway they wish to speak with you
really oh my gaw take a break guys this could be it
mr marsh this is andrew lloyd webber
helleow
stephen schwartz
hey bro
mr elton john and stephen sondheim
sup bro
not much sup with you guys
no i mean "sup bro"
sit down mr marsh we need to have a talk
we got wind of your musical just what the hell do you think youre doing
same as you guys trying to get men lengthier better-quality blowjobs
youre making it too obvious women are gonna figure out what were doin
musicals are about subtext
my musical has lots of subtext
"a blowjob isnt with your mouth its with your heart now get on your knees and put that heart to work"
and then she does its a metaphor
bro whats metaphorical about a musical called "splooge-drenched blowjob queen"
tricking bitches into hour-long blowjobs is an art form you have to leave it to the professionals
well sorry if you guys think you have a monopoly on subtext but us up-and-comers have a voice too
youre gonna ruin everything you idiot
sorry if my work isnt up to your standards and now i need to get back to rehearsals oh and if "splooge-drenched blowjob queen" wins the tony dont expect to be invited to my after party
what do you want larry
you make me come out of my shell shellyyou give me strength where there was only feari ate at a burger king today shellyand stood up to a boy who called me "queer"when you pushed me off the diving board ifelland you make the world a nicer place shellyso i can come out of my shell
hey do you wanna play settlers of catan on xbox
blow--- job--- queendont stop giving that blowjob even when youre tired dont stop dont stopshaaaaroooon
randy randy brah
uh and hold sorry folks were in a hold what is it now
stephen sondheim is really pissed off randy he says he wants to challenge you to a bro down
fine he wants to bro down ill bro down
randy no stephen sondheim is the greatest broadway composer alive today perhaps the greatest of all time you do not want to bro down with him
then what am i supposed to do run
dont bro down against sondheim randy its suicide
ive studied musicals ive seen them all i could do this lets bro down
oh no you built another settlement
and i got a victory point for the most roads connecting settlements
oh wow
theyre having such a great time together i really wanna thank you sharon
no no little larry is really making shelly come out of her shell too
i have to admit it makes me a little nervous having larry up there without a life preserver on but i guess we have to take changes sometimes
thats what were doing putting our faith in randys new musical
thats right i i hear his musical is getting a lot of attention that it really has a chance of making it
oho more than a chance randys actually having a meeting right now with stephen sondheim
whassup brah
what brah
sup brah
take a swing brah
right here brah
lets go sondheim wipe the street with his punk ass
what makes you the brauthority brah

youre alright marsh if its cool with you bro elton and andrew and all of us wanna help you with your musical
hey really
yeh we can help youse out a lil bit with the subtext
how about instead of "splooge-drenched blowjob queen" we call it "the woman in white"
oh that is beautiful
yeeeeeeeah
and a cheer to randy marsh welcome to brodway
brodwaaay

thats it randy turn this car around right now
i cant
why
aww alright look theres something i should have told you a long time ago sharon broadway musicals arent what you think they are theyre subliminal propaganda to get women to give more blowjobs on the outside its all singing and dancing but buried in it are commands to perform oral sex its called subtext
thats ridiculous musicals dont make me wanna give blowjobs
daugh do you remember the night after we saw "wicked"
yes oh well yeah but-
and after "lion king" in new york "godspell" "mamma mia"
oh my gosh
broadway shows sole purpose is to make women famished for blowjobs im so sorry sharon
nuh-nn no this is crazy musical theater people are respected refined cultured
no theyre theyre bros sharon stephen sondheim elton john andrew lloyd webber theyre total bros who hang out at hooters sharon im so sorry
it cant be ive loved broadway musicals ever since i saw "grease" with jacob harrison and his brother kip and we- oh my god
aaaa
aaaa
shelly
no one cares about wicked peoplenow shes gone but we dont careand are we gonna live in peace and all live free youll seeo heaven knows we know what goodness iso heaven knows wicked people arent goodfrom head to toe-
shelly shelly shelly come on we have to go
dad what are you doing here
right now shelly shelly you are not watching this trash now come on
would you mind im trying to enjoy this musical with my granddaughter
oh you fucking pervert
alright get the hell out of here you
shelly
randy randy what are you doing
its time to put an end to broadway once and for all
while youll do great here in the emerald city im sure you cant wait to go
singers
ohhhh
hey its spider-man
sorry sorry
agh
sorry folks we are in a hold we are in a hold
awwwwww
the musical came to a screeching halt as patrons flooded out the exits and water flooded the theater the only fatality was a young boy who could not get out of the theater in time the fire chief said it was unfortunate the child was not wearing a life preserver
shelly im sorry your little friend was killed by spider-man tonight just know that for spider-man to do what he did he must have had a very good reason spider-man works in mysterious ways shelly and wherever he is he loves you
its just so wrong for men to m- manipulate women like that i dont care how much singing and dancing there is a womans mouth is sacred tomorrow i am calling womans day magazine and exposing the whole conspiracy im sorry sharon i love you i shouldnt have tried to brainwash you you have every right to be mad
i dont know if i can really be that mad at you for doing something every guy in america does
really
oh randy the bottom line is i love going to those shows if the fallout from that is i make you really happy for a while well i guess theyre actually a pretty magical thing
oh sharon youre the best
so what broadway show do you think is coming to denver next
i dont know but whatever it is its worth the ticket price because couples that pay to see it are stronger better and much much happier
"the book of mormon" youll get a blowjob
