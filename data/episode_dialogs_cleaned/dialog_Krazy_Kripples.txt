all right chris the whole world is waiting why dont you show us what stem-cell research has done for you amazing isnt that amazing folks now chris therere some people who say stem-cell research is wrong that taking cells from a fetus is unethical
well it just proves that the public needs to be educated about stem-cell research see the stem cells from a fetus like this one can form into whatever cells of the body are damaged they are the most powerful thing on the planet
and how does someone like yourself make use of the stem cells chris

well well gene hackman my nemesis from the movies how are you

christopher ive come to ask you to stop what youre doing

using stem cells is like playing god you should leave nature alone
and go back to the way i was is that what youre saying hackman
im saying that sometimes you need to just live with the cards youre dealt christopher
stop calling me christopher that name no longer has meaning to me christopher was someone who lived in a wheelchair always being pushed around by others the old christopher reeve is dead from now on i am chris
sixty-five bottles of beer on the wall six-
payback time mothafucka
jesus christ holy gguacamole freakin frijoles leapin l-langosta
east side bloods
were detectives hyde and richardson from the special gang unit in denver

the b-bloods
you know smart-mouth your rival gang the bloods are at war with the crips they kill each other all the time
the-they do
dont act like you dont know you lil punk the crips and bloods hate each other and if you stay in that gang youre gonna end up dead too
but but why do they hate each other
look kid i used to be a crip myself but im not anymore
oh so you used sssytemm cells like christopher reeve
come on the only way these kids are gonna get out of their gang is get killed
sarah
oh boy timmy we should have never started a gang for people crippled from birth now theyre at war with the people who are crippled from an accident boy were we wrong
tim-mih
wow w-weve got to do something timmy weve gotta get the crips and bloods to s-stop fighting i bet if we could just get them together but how wu-wait a minute ive got it a lock-in at the rec center we did it for our church once all we do is rent out the rec center overnight they lock the doors so nobody can leave and then everyone has the whole night to play in the swimming pool and laugh and talk
timmih
you get all the crips you can to the rec center tomorrow night timmy and ill try to get all the bloods there
timmih
this is gonna be t-terrific
tom several years ago actor christopher reeve had a horrible accident and was paralyzed the irony of course is that the man who played superman could no longer walk america watched in wonder as he managed to move one of his fingers then his arms and now seen for the first time on hbc christopher reeve is going to lift a truck up over his head
oh what a fighter
that brave brave man
hes an inspiration to us all
tom the irony is even more irony-y as it appears that the stem cells have given christopher reeve almost superhuman strength
chris thats enough
hello gene so good to see you
youre cured chris its time to stop using stem cells
stem-cell research has made me stronger than i ever thought possible why stop now
uh tom apparently gene hackman the man who played supermans enemy lex luthor in the movies has now shown up as a celebrity protester of stem-cell research if that isnt ironic tom i dont know what is
theyre affecting your mind chris if you wont stop using stem cells then well stop you
stop me stop me ha you wont stop me hack man ha ha ha ha ha haa haa ya ha ha yaa haha
tom if irony were made of strawberries wed all be drinking a lot of smoothies right now

muthafuckin crips tryin to smoke us all out
what the hell is goin on here
its called a lock-in at the rec center we can use all the rec center facilities we can play basketball go swimming or even just kick it in the lounge area with some games and p-puzzles
timmih
but nobody can leave until its seven am so if you wanna have a good time youre all just gonna have to learn to get along theeerrres pizzaaa
tom over five years ago doctors told christopher reeve that he would never walk again but the resilient actor fought back struggled against all odds and has now built his very own legion of doom the once immobile mr reeves new organization will be committed to world domination and evil what an inspirational story tom
i have chosen each member of this elite group of supervillains for their outstanding treachery their desire for world conquest and their hatred of all things good and ive assembled this group for one purpose to once and for all find a way to get rid of hack man
uhhh how about domination of the world
yeah or uh death to the infidels
silence our job is to see to it that hack man is put out of commission
oh boy general disarray may- maybe we just ought to stay outta this one
not so fast chris
hack man
we just helped pass a ban on stem-cell research your fetus-sucking days are over
no noooo
and now were going to put you somewhere where you can never touch another fetus again
you stupid mofos are dead
make the first shot punk
hold it dont you see it doesnt matter if we were crippled from birth or crippled in an accident were all brothers
