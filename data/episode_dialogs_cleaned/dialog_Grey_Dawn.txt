friends we gather in this place to mourn the victims of yesterdays tragedy nine good people who were run over in the street by an elderly woman driver
oh god memorial services are sooo boring
you insensitive asshole cartman nine people died
yeah but like eight of them were hippies mostly hippies go to farmers markets mostly
it is sometimes hard in times like these to understand gods way why would he allow nine innocent people to be run down in the prime of their lives by a senior citizen who perhaps shouldnt be driving it is then that we must understand gods sense of humor is very different from our own he does not laugh at the simple "man walks into a bar" joke no god needs complex irony and subtle farcical twists that seem macabre to you and me all that we can hope for is that god got his good laugh and a tragedy such as this will never happen again
look out
huh was that a stop sign back there ooooh i think i hit a pothole
hey dad how come they let old people drive
well stan its a very fragile issue
but they kill people
sometimes yes but senior citizens have to be dealt with very gingerly stan we cant just take their licenses away
ill be goddamned if they think they can take my license away
oooh hi dad
i heard what you said you wanna take drivin privileges away from seniors well let me tell you something peckerface i worked fifty five years in the steel mill
yes dad
and i flew spitfires over germany in world war ii
yes i know
and i will be god-damned if the government thinks it can step in and take away my right to drive
i think old people should have rights grandpa i just dont wanna die
damnit mona this isnt the fastest way to country kitchen buffet
no but its the shortest i save the most gas that way
you save the most gas if you take the highway to country kitchen buffet
less miles means less gas you old fool
theres country kitchen right there

right there youre gonna miss it
is this the parking lot
i think so
another death tonight by a senior citizen motorist carl zorn of pine junction was killed instantly when struck by a vehicle driven by pete and lydia malman who were trying to find country kitchen buffet this latest tragedy comes only two days after the accident in deer creek where three construction workers and a bulldozer were run down by senior citizen paul thom who was trying to find country kitchen buffet public outcry is forcing the dmv to consider suspending the licenses of all seniors over seventy though no decision has yet to be made

some of us would rather die
well we can certainly help you with that too
we arent second-class citizens
thats right you can take our licenses but youll never take our pride
yeah
ooooh isnt this great you guys being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong

god-damnit billy youre supposed to listen to your dad right well im your dads dad and that means you get in this car before i tan all your hides

whats that
the american association of retired persons the largest political group in the country when seniors like me are bein discriminated against the aarp comes and sets it right and youre gonna be sorry when they get here
and so you see children genghis khan was a "mongol" not to be confused with a "mongoloid" like the actor nicolas cage okay now who can tell me in what the first film by a mongoloid

well alright well its about damn time hey everyone were taking the town
seniors were taking the town over

mrs wyland seniors are taking over the town would you like a gun
oh i suppose so
what the hell is going on
shut your piehole and get over there
randy what is this
hey you are now under the authority of the aarp
ha there you go mr smartmouth look at you now
dad what are you doing
marvin
thats right
yeah
have you all got alzheimers the-theyre not gonna listen to a bunch of whacked out senior citizens
heh well tell them if they dont give us our demands well start killin hostages
huh right theyre gonna really believe that
isnt that a little extreme bill
heh no we gotta be tough just like with those damned japs
this is insane dad you all need to stop right now before more people get hurt
the time when you can tell me what to do is over pucky-boy were in charge now
all right weve got control of the mayors office and the fire station
reinforcements have arrived from the nursing home in conifer
good hell us senior citizens could take over the entire country
weve got company
attention seniors lay down your weapons and turns yourselves over
mrs applegate show em we mean business
all right
what do you want
heh
we want our licenses back
yeah
thats right and we want more money in medi-care
yeah
and we want those damned kids to stop skateboardin on the sidewalk
yeah
hey dad
stan boys youre safe
dad why is everyone letting old people do this why doesnt somebody stop them
theyve tried to stop them son but the seniors get up so early in the morning they get everything done before everyone else is even awake
theyre saying something about taking over the entire country
yes and now seeing how early they get up i dont see how anyone can stop them wait a minute you boys you get up almost as early as they do you can fight them
no come on dad cant you guys do it
no son we like to sleep in
two hostages come front and center
theyre coming get out of here before they see you run to the hills and find a way to fight them go boys avenger me avenge me
all right check it out kenny did reconnaissance on the town
so our only solution is to cut off their life force
we cant fight them cartman
no but we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply here
country kitchen buffet
yeah you take out country kitchen buffet and old people wont know what to do
thats a retarded idea cartman
is it two years ago they closed the country kitchen buffet in steamboat springs and all the old people died of starvation in less than a week
yeah i remember hearing about that
even if it could work how would we go about shutting it down
i think i have a plan though well have to do it tonight
well start by sneaking into town cleverly disguised as black people at 545 kenny and kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town meanwhile stan and i sneak into the mayors office and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed
nine oclock we rendezvous at the country kitchen buffet where we strap the explosives and the timer to kyles chest we say our tearful goodbyes to kyle and then we send him inside
yeah
all right
(woohoo)
aw yeah
we did it
yeah or we just go to country kitchen buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors cant get in
well right or we could always do that
all right everyone round up your ammunition and get ready to move were takin this war further out
all right
uh i appreciate what the aarp is tryin to do for us but uh all we want is our licenses back
huh heck no this is goin too well were gonna take the whole country back wipe out everyone below the age of sixty five
wipe em out what are you senile
come on everyone its time to plan for phase 2 what the heck huh what is this its 6 am c-country kitchen should be open
its not open it has to be
try a window
theyre blocked from the inside
no let us in let us in
open the door its six am
open the country kitchen buffet for us
you have to let us in
all right everyone area secure collect their weapons and free the hostages that was a great strategy boys you may very well have saved this entire country
whoa-ho-ho-ooh what happened is it over
everything is fine control of the town is back to you folks
country kitchen wha-what happened
sir what should we do with this one
its up to the townspeople
well i think he learned his lesson huh dont you feel silly now dad i think somebody owes us all an apology yes he does
oh stop it dad this is partly your fault
huh
look all grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child i think half of what he was angry about wasnt what you were doing but how you were doing it
thats right
and grandpa you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior but you should also realize that when youre behind the wheel youre a killing machine
i know i guess sometimes us seniors need to know when to stop driving so we dont put the responsibility on our families
well i think this has been a real learning experience for the marsh family people died but we all grew a little lets just go home
sure ill drive
thats our grandpa
dude i hate my family
