so what does the atf do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide
oh dont worry we wont let that happen even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them
whats the situation
apparently weve got at least five dozen men and women in there who intend to commit suicide when the meteor shower starts
any luck talking to somebody in the house

oh dear weve angered bosley
tom im standing in front of a house where a religious cult is planning to commit mass suicide when the meteor shower starts
whoa cool
i wanna be a reporter someday
just moments ago a couple emerged from the house according to the atf the couple refused to cooperate then pulled out very big guns and started shooting everyone the atf had no choice but to shoot the insane couple and now a standoff has ensued
oh looks like that cult is about to be blown into tiny bits
the atf commander tells us that he has reason to believe there may be children inside and that they are the primary concern of all there are choppers here along with several tanks the commander is very concerned about what the mood is inside
wait a minute oh my god dude thats this house they think our parents are the religious cult
do you think someday i can be a reporter
we just received a photo from the recon team of the action inside the house showing evidence that there are indeed innocent children trapped inside those sick cult fanatic bastards
dude
hey uhour parents arent religious fantastics why we gotta tell them that theyre makin an awful mistake dont we
yes come on angels looks like we have a new mission
randy youre making me feel unimportant talk talk damn you
im just having a hard time with what we did in the hot tub
so so now we cant be friends
i didnt say that i mean i dont know i i just feel so strange i know its ridiculous but i cant help feeling like people here know you know like even though nobody could know cause we said wed never tell anybody
we said wed never tell anybody
well of course we wouldnt
oh uh i didnt realize that
yuh you didnt tell anybody did you
well uh uh a few people yeah
what why the hell would you do that
you didnt say not to tell anyone
well of course i thought it would be implied when you masturbate with another guy in a hot tub you assume that nobody is gonna tell anybody
listen to you youre yelling at me youve never yelled at me before
aaaw
hey you guys weve got a big problem the atf is outside and they think youre all a religious cult youve gotta go talk to them
huh how come theyre actin that way stan huh uh how come theyre laughin and fallin down and such
mom go look outside
mommys little boopie-kins
uh let me handle this stan uh now l-listen up and listen good everyone why im awful disappointed in you drinkin and carryin on this way why you uhyou should be ashamed of yourselves uh if you dont get outside right now and tell those army guys youre not religious fantastics theres why theres gonna be heck to pay uh heck i tell ya
come on were gonna have to go tell em ourselves
lay down your weapons
we dont have any weapons
go back inside and tell everyone that they are surrounded tell them to come out peacefully and we will not shoot them
whoa
get back inside
i dont think theyre gonna come out use the ganz technique
whats the ganz technique
this is what we did in waco play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out nobody can stand this much cher this is her new album if this doesnt drive them out nothing will
thats great music mr mackey what is that

come on we have to find out whats happening
im standing now with danny ganz the commander of the atf commander what is the latest
we have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house they are refusing to come out and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts which should be any moment now
see how reporters get to wear those cool jackets thats why i wanna be a reporter
so what are your plans commander
right now our plan is to burn the house down if we set it on fire theyll have no choice but to come out
oh dear god theyre gonna set us on fire uhoh great jesus son of mary wife of joseph what are we gonna do huh huhoh sweet joseph husband of mary but not father of sweet jesus-
sh
setting them on fire seems a little dangerous commander
it is but we cant let them kill themselves
we have to let them know that this isnt a cult party
but we cant theyll just shoot at us again
uhuh theyre gonna burn us up and act like nothin happened oh sweet jesus mary mother of jesus wife of joseph father to mary well- wait mary wife uh oh hold on
come on angels weve got a new mission and this time its for real
for hours now the atf has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house the meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment and so time is running out
hoh look harolds doing it again hm huh hnmkay
this is jill munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party as you can see this is a perfectly normal party nobody is killing themselves we tried to tell atf people but they shot at us anything else
tell them not to burn us down
oh yeah dont burn us please jill munroe gfn news
now what do we do
now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters
hey im a real reporter
youre right you are dougie you did an awesome job
attention cult people do not commit mass suicide there are so many reasons not to kill yourselves flowers for instance and back rubs alright im through trying to reason with them send in the negotiator
excuse me but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics
we know what were doing we did this all before in waco
uh yes but you totally screwed up waco you killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves
look you see this you see this
yes
