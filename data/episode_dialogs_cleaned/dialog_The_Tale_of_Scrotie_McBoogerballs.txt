oh really sweet
its called the catcher in the rye and it has some very risqu√© parts
all right
and strong vulgar language
(awesome dude)
and in fact many schools across the country still ban this book because its thought to be so inappropriate
oho man i cant wait

no on come on lets read it now
mr garrison didnt the guy who shot john lennon say it was because of this book

i know im almost at the end and theres nothing
motherfucker the whole thing i read the whole fucking thing i kept thinking "alright i guess the cool offensive stuff must be coming" and then after like a hundred pages i was like "alright i guess all the dirty stuff is at the end" and then i got to the last page and i was all "the fuck is this i just read a book for nothing"

but you told me i did
yeah but that was when we thought we were gonna get in trouble asshole
hey hey you guys leave butters alone hes a very fragile artist
hes so brooding and full of angst

butters doesnt deserve any credit for scrotie mcboogerballs we deserve all the credit
oh god you guys are pathetic

no let me tell you somethin fellers you always take advantage of me and after reading the catcher in the rye ive learned youre nothing but phonies im not letting you trick me this time so the four of you can just suck on my wiener
that inconsiderate jerk
today on today we meet the author of the book that has swept the nation and has now spawned tvs most popular game show "how long can you listen to scrotie mcboogerballs on audiobook" "and not vomit" the book is full of disgusting words and acts including sarah jessica parker who is mentioned four hundred and sixty-five times matthew broderick are you upset your wife is made fun of so much in the book
well obviously i just think its wrong to make fun of anybodys physical appearance my wife is a beautiful woman and i know that most people agree with me
uh huh and matthew how come a transvestite donkey witch is standing next to you and why is it wearing a dress
joining us now is the author of the book leopold stotch along with his parents
hello matt
hi everyone
you must be pretty proud of your son
oh we certainly are were thrilled to learn hes so very talented
and we also learned that your son is grounded is that correct
yes we did have to ground him for the language in the novel of course
i have to come right to my room after school
but we are very very proud nonetheless
young man now that you are a respected author have you met any famous people
not yet but as soon as im not grounded anymore im hopin to meet kim kardashian i wanna jump on her belly
all right uh yeah huh butters my favorite part of your novel was when scrotie mcboogerballs slid his head up into the horses sorry i uh was that chapter a slam on health care reform as people suggested
uh yeah pretty much i think think so
is that why the doctor character pulls out all the strings
little boy are you ever worried somebody might take your book wrong and try to kill someone like when that guy tried to shoot ronald reagan after reading the catcher in the rye
oh is that who the book was tellin me to kill ohhh kill ronald reagan kill ronald reagan
ronald reagan is dead now butters
oh really oh yeah gosh dangit
more and more of us are against this book every day the author is cruel and offensive and for these reasons we demand this book be banned from all school stores and libraries this book is nothing but smut and vulgarity purely for the sake of smut and vulgarity
thats just because youre too young to understand the underlying themes
there are no underlying themes we know that for a fact
you just fail to understand what the author meant
the author meant to be as gross as possible because it was funny
no no no thats such a simplistic view
goddamnit there is no deeper meaning in this book read it again
oh so youre suggesting that the author just arbitrarily made fun of sarah jessica parker for no reason
yes
but what would be the point
there is no point its just because sarah jessica parker is fuckin ugly
no writer would take the time to make fun of sarah jessica parker just because they think shes ugly
yes they would
it is because miss jessica parker is a metaphor in the book for oppression felt by the lower class
what dude that is not in the book at all
boys this book is an important look at how liberals are hurting this country
what
wait scrotie mcboogerballs is the most conservative-hating liberal in literature
what book did you read
theres nothing about liberals or conservatives
ohohh yeah then why did sarah jessica parkers butt-cheese end up in scroties milkshake
breaking news from acclaimed author leopold stotch the artist has announced that he is working on a second novel as a followup to his wildly successful bestseller we got a statement from the writer who is still grounded in his room
can you give the public any idea what the new book is about
well its kind of about love and betrayal the inner workings of the human mind
will it be as sick and disgusting as your first book
oh its raunchy alright i know what my readers want and im going to deliver
butters away from the window you are being grounded
sorry dad i was just bein the voice of a generation
i cant believe they wont ban our book
i know its so much worse than catcher in the retarded rye
(its fucking disgusting)
all right you guys i know what we have to do weve got to kill sarah jessica parker
what
think about it guys if somebody kills sarah jessica parker then theyll assume that somebody did it because of what was in the book then the book will get banned
dude were not killing sarah jessica parker
shhh be right with you we dont have to kill her we can just help her get killed
shut up cartman just face it we lost this one
kenny we only have to help her get killed and then we totally get back at butters
(okay)
ms jessica parker over here
well the day has finally arrived the eagerly awaited second novel from the author of scrotie mcboogerballs hit the shelves this morning and apparently bookstores are jammed
al how is it out there
i dont know if you could see this guys but uh the line stretches all the way around the block people waiting for their turn to get inside the bookstore and read the novel and they brought trash bags and buckets to throw up in just a festive atmosphere here matt and meredith
well weve got our vomit buckets ready too because coming up a very special in-studio treat
thats right we are going to have a reading of the first five chapters of the book here live in our studio na-now we must warn you that this is from the same author who wrote the most graphic obscene novel of all time so brace yourselves for some very harsh language take it away morgan freeman
the poop that took a pee chapter 1 douglas had to poop his butt was all stinky because he had to poop so badly there was a gross woman named rebecca who was sunbathing all naked and she was fat douglas walked up to her and said "i need to poop" "okay" rebecca replied "i like poop" douglas squatted down over the fat sunbathing lady and went poop the poop sat there on rebeccas boobs looking like a wiener chapter 2
see any hunters yet
(not yet)
doing good ms jessica parker just hang out right there
guys stop stop we dont have to do this
(huh)
butters wrote a second book
so what
so dude if butters wrote a second book then everyones gonna know he couldnt have written the first one
we can get people to believe us now
oh dude sweet
"why are we here" douglas cried as poop came out his wiener in a long thin strip it was wiener poop which is the grossest poop of all
"the pee he got on the womans leg and she screamed pooping out her boobs"
"and so when the pee got mixed with the poop it smelled like a butt"
aw dude this is even lamer than we thought
people are gonna want butters head on a platter
are you reading this marsha what do you think
so far i think its its incredible ih it might be better than his first book
i agree it wasnt as edgy but its like he hes gone back to his roots
what
you cant be serious you people like this
some of the imagery is unbelievable
a woman pooping out her boobs is not good imagery
says you you must be a pro-life nut huh didnt like what the book had to say
what are you talking about this book is as pro-life as it gets
oh come on
god-damnit will you people stop reading into stuff that isnt there
"and the poop and the pee lived happily every after the end" kill the phonies kill the phonies
today my sisters and i are gonna shop for underwear
yaaay
can i go with you girls
our nation is still reeling from the tragic deaths of the kardashians the shooter claims he was driven to commit the slaughter immediately after reading the poop that took a pee by leopold "butters" stotch its all over the kardiashians wiped out in the blink of an eye all because one little prick had to go and write a book
leopold stotch i hope they bury you you evil fuck
dude people are pissed off at you butters
i know
theyre saying theyre gonna ban both your books now completely youre not making any more money
you think i care about that my writing got the most beautiful woman in the world killed i loved her and now shes gone and its because of me
ah oh butters itll be all right listen weve all learned that people look for meaning in books and sometimes even if it isnt there theyll try and invent their own meaning
yeah dude eh thats why we all need to avoid books and stick to television
thang thanks fellas ill definitely never write again i think i can get through this
thats good butters because we need to tell you something
what
you were sleepwalking again and dressed sarah jessica parker up in a moose suit you left her in the forest and she got shot by a hunter
what oh no
yep sorry youre gonna have to come down and admit it was you
aw aw i got her killed too aw uh oh well at least she was ugly
