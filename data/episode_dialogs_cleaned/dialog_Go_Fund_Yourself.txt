man this sucks
uhhh stan arent you supposed to be in school
no dad we dont need school anymore were forming a startup company
a startup company a company that does what
no we dont wanna do anything
yeah thats why we wanna have a startup company
yeah were sick of school but all the good attention-getting startup names are taken
wuhuhull boys theres more to starting a company than having a catchy name
nnnno there isnt
you guys you guys its awesome holy shit you guys you guys ive got it
what
its the greatest startup company name ever
what tell us
washington redskins
washington redskins
its sooo sweet
im pretty sure thats taken cartman
its not dude some dumb court-thingy and the trademark got pulled you can use it aaand the logo
washington redskins i like it
(me too)
what
dude theres already brand name awareness and its instantly recognizable
wait guys this this doesnt seem legal
kyle youre not hearing me the trademark has been pulled we can do whatever we want
you alright dude
yeah i just well i just thought our company name would be more like uh or-original
its a strong name dude its like aggressive and masculine like boner forest but boner forest was taken
yeah but maybe we need a name thats more affirming like shows what we stand for
we dont stand for anything remember our company plan guys start up cash in sell out bro down
im just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to
we already got a dollar
what
one dollar pledge
(yahoo)
i told you guys "washington redskins" totally gets peoples attention
another two dollars
no way
sittin on our asses here we come
another new startup company is gaining a lot of attention on the internet theyre a company that does absolutely nothing and theyre called the washington redskins the redskins started as what appeared to be some kind of adolescent prank but almost overnight it has become one of the most heavily funded projects on kickstarter why did you give five dollars to the washington redskins kickstarter
i dunno i just uh they dont do anything thats pretty sweet i dunno i thought it was funny
by pledging just one or two dollars you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff if you pledge $10 or more you will receive this luxurious company micro badge
its called crowd-funding using the internet to raise money without having to pay back your investors a tactic that some believe is unfair and impersonal
washington redskins go fuck yourself sure wed be happy to take your money yup go to our kickstarter page okay nice idiot uh huh fuck you bye bye
you are eric cartman
yes i know
my name is dan snyder im the president and owner of the washington redskins
oh cool please take a seat
thank you but i will stand
nice i like that
young man we ask that you please stop using the name washington redskins for your organization
stop but why
because we are the washington redskins and we are a football team you have no right to use our name to get attention
uhhh the trademark got pulled so im totaly free to use the name actually um butters could you get that
washington redskins go fuck yourself
look dont you see that when you call your organization "the washington redskins" its offensive to us
how is it offensive
how is it offensive jesus what-
we are a proud team mr cartman we have no wish to be associated with people who actively do nothing
makes us feel like a joke
guys guys we have total respect for you when we name our company "washington redskins" it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people
uh i know i cant legally make you stop using our name but but wont you just do it out of decency
mmmm noooo because i dont want to aaaand we cant just change the name of our company cause its like super hard but hey from one redskin to another go fuck yourself
all around the world people are saying they are inspired by the washington redskins the internet startup company has raised so much money in kickstarter that now more groups are doing the same
more news on the washington redskins tonight their defiant f-you attitude has now caught the attention of the terrorist group isis the terrorists said they admire the washington redskins and want to try it and follow their business model
well lets not forget marsha that theres a people here okay who are not happy about the use of the name the football washington redskins
well yeah but does anyone really care about them
dude this is sooo cool we only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid
guys we need to talk to you i really dont think we wanna be a company that isis looks up to we should maybe issue a statement saying that we dont sanction them
oh no no you guys we started this company to do nothing if we start doing stuff now itll put it all at risk
people arent gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we dont care about anything
digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the washington redskins are all about now come on guys if you wanna be a successful business then you have to be honest about what you are once you take a stand on something youre pretending like your company is about more than money then all of a sudden youre the nfl and and your players get caught molesting little boys
thats the catholic church
nfl catholic church same thing okay lets use the catholic church you take a moral stand on issues you say youre about honor and integrity and the next thing you know your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator
thats the nfl
its the same thing kyle the point is if we as an organization claim to be about high morality somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and its most likely going to be butters
oh no
all right i really dont want to have to do this but im not happy with the direction this company is taking
well what are you gonna do go back to school im not going back there man
maybe ill start my own company
well thats fine you cant call yourself "washington redskins"
i dont want to its a stupid name
well i guess everythings out on the table now huh kyle
yeah i guess i guess everything is
stan do you think our name is stupid too
i dont know i but i dont know if my future is with this company either
well then i wish you both well in your new venture good-bye
hang on is this the company where i dont get raped yeah he-here right okay im uh stayin here
is the league just going to sit by and while my team and my players are compared to isis you have to do something commissioner goodell what are you going to do about this
i will get it right and do whatever is necessary to accomplish that
what
we will continue to identify and add expertise to our team
thats the most ridiculous nothing answer ive ever heard what are you gonna do now
everyone will participate in educating sessions starting in the next month
ugh this thing is broken
we can add and we will do more do more do more
get all the nfl owners on skype this thing is broken again
and so i call upon the help of all owners you cannot let my people be belittled like this
dan you dont wanna be dealin with this stuff let the goodell-bot do it
the stupid thing isnt working
i will get it right
man that thing hasnt worked right since we bought it
look my team is starting to lose hope you have to use your influence to make these people change their name
did you tell them were about honor and integrity
if the goodell bot is broken we must stay out of it more than even usual
and so im alone what if they ridicule the 49ers team next or make fun of jerry jones because his eyes are too far apart
my eyes arent too far apart
if we get them to change their logo will it make you happy
uh i guess we can live with that
then it is decided we will make them change their logo begin mas behind-the-scenes under-the-table enforcement of our wishes now
go
thank god
fuck youuuu fuck youuuu fuck you up there fuck you "fuck you" those words mean a great deal to us they help us express just how we as a company see things differently there are a lot of startup companies on kickstarter but after today i think youll agree that washington redskins is the most exciting as you know the redskins have been on the forefront of kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves and now our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations weve come up with to begin with we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side but we didnt stop there we also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes and probably most exciting of all we have actually updated the company from the inside out we received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our redskins logo as a company we want to be firm but we also want to be flexible and so we thought if we have to change our logo it should be more in step with todays times but still define us as the leading kickstarter company what we came up with is the new company logo that i think youll all agree is very exciting now when people hear the name "redskins" they will immediately think "titties" and "balls" its just a bold new way that we can say "we dont fucking care" go redskins
its so awesome dude our company already has a hundred backers and we still have 14 days to go
yeah
you okay bro
i just never saw myself owning a company called "furry balls plopped menacingly on the table inc"
give it time itll grow on you
why dont we just call it "untitled startup company"
because that sounds like we dont have anything weve been through this already stan
yeah i know that but a good company should never have seven words in its title
well whattaya mean
i just feel that somewhere out there theres a perfect startup company name and i need to be free to go find it
oh well i certainly dont want you to feel that "furry balls plopped menacingly on the table" is holding you back
good luck with your company dude
yeah good luck with yours
its just incredible harry everyone is using kickstarter for everything
and for every project funded we get 5%
its like we dont even have to do anything and we just make money
sitting on our asses here we come
caw-caw caw-caw hoohoo hoohoohoo
huh
goooood morning guys
happy deadline day
we made it guys we cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4 3 2 1 thats the deadline
oh boy this is like christmas morning
what the hell cant find the server kickstartercom kickstarter where is kickstarter get it up on the phone butters come on i wanna know how much our company is worth
its not coming up on my phone either i holy mother mary
(what)
somebody raided kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground
what
somebody killed kickstarter
who the hell would burn kickstarter to the ground oh my god that weird little jewy guy kyle
what the hell is wrong "cant find the server" kickstarter
you son of a bitch
what
you broke kickstarter
no i just cant get it to load
nobody can its gone you just couldnt take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be
my company was on kickstarter too why would i get rid of it
well somebody did
it doesnt matter you guys theres something a lot more important here do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together we all had a common goal and we werent gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down but somewhere between starting up and selling out we we lost our way we cant do this on our own we need each other
hes right we should do a merger
a merger its too late for that you guys kickstarter is gone we dont have a company we dont have anything
yes we do we have a sweet name i was wrong cartman "washington redskins" is the perfect name i think maybe i was jealous that i didnt come up with it
it is really sweet
and we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out
yeah we can do it fellas itll be like old times
whattaya say cartman
fuck you fuck you everyone yes fuck you all thanks how do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace as you know our goal at washington redskins is to not do anything and make money not doing it
when kickstarter went down many saw their startup projects die but here at washington redskins we saw opportunity people still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects and with the redskins you can now go fund yourself and the idea is simple you the people go out and raise all your own money and give the washington redskins 5%
you will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing it is the biggest "fuck you" we have ever come up with but we didnt stop there because a new company direction also means of course a new and improved logo
go redskins
a beautiful night in arlington texas as the dallas cowboys get set to take on the washington redskins that is of course washington redskins the football team not washington redskins the audacious crowd-funding company
yeah and if you ask me the redskins are a scam
youre talking about the crowd-funding company- redskins right
thats right an-and now youve got terrorist groups like isis using the redskins to raise their money i-i dont like what the redskins are doing
those redskins
yeah whatever
its over our name has been reduced to a stereotype and a joke
yeah lets just go home
no no we cannot give up we have been through too much together we have fought eagle and bear the eagles only beat us by three points
yeah but i just feel pretty stupid wearing this now
yeah
come on guys
where will we go what will we do
dont let them break you dont let them win
and the cowboys are still set to kick off but there doesnt seem to be anyone to kick off to
yeah and jerry jones must be happy this means a forfeit another win for the cowboys
wait a minute it appears a lone redskin is making his way out of the locker room the cowboys kick it off
hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut hut
oh
just stay down for the love of god
hut hut hut
stop make it stop
just stay down
please
just make him stay down
go redskins go redskins
boy this is the life huh guys
we finally did it
i just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch
what the heck is that
whoa whoa what
change your name
it doesnt belong in todays society
change our name
but you all thought our name was sweet
theres nothing sweet about a people who were decimated a once proud nation that finally lost hope and left their leader to be massacred by cowboys in a defiant last stand
when was that
last night
until you change your name we are asking all your subscribers to boycott you
thats right isis will no longer use your insensitive company for its fundraising
yeah alright
good for you isis
well what the hell do we do
i guess we gotta go back to school
