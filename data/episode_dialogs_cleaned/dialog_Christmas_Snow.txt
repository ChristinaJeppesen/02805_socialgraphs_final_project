hey come on guys its still christmas and we have to make the best of it how about we all drive around a little
oh whats the point jimbo whats the point in driving now
nobodys out shopping the town is dead our economy depends on the holidays
we dont know who passed the ordinance mayor but well the people feel left out
theres only one thing we can do were going to have to ask an old friend for help and hope that he somehow forgives us
hello mayor everybody what are you doing here
mr marsh south park needs you
for what
everyones down in the dumps nobodys buying presents or going to holiday events
people they need some holiday spirit
we think that a little weed might put everyone in a better mood
guys my season is over tegridy farms season ended weeks ago
we understand but couldnt you do like a limited-edition run just to get people through the holidays
you want me to do a christmas special
yes south park needs tegridy farms
we all do randy
but guys look behind you the crops are dead how am i supposed to sell weed to people now
ill tell you how because youre randy marsh and theres one thing you have that nobody else does tegridy
tegridy
you a-youre not gonna let a little cold weather stand in your way tegridy farms is about community
and community is what matters thats tegridy thats tegridy weed
well youre right about that let me call my marijuana science specialist and ill see what i can do
thank you marsh may god bless tegridy farms
look im sorry randy but marijuana just doesnt grow in the cold
so we use the greenhouse theres gotta be a way to make a christmas special its what everyone wants
wwwait a minute how about we repackage some of the surplus i have lots of left-over mexican joker
thats cause people really didnt like mexican joker im not gonna just repackage it thats not special
okay so how about we combine- whats left of the mexican joker with some of the season finale
nagh
whats wrong
its just it needs something else just mixing old product together and naming it something new thats not special and its not tegridy its just not tegridy its gonna be your birthday soon jesus i wanna make something as special as you are i just need the right idea
i hate the holidays
come on tolkien lets wrap it up and get out of here
dude our parents seem really bummed out

oh hi mayor
we need to talk marsh
whats going on are people not liking the christmas special so far
oh people loooove the christmas special so marsh what exactly is in this christmas snow
okay okay look you busted us its a mix of different strains of marijuana we had left over from last season i know its wrong
nonono what is the white stuff on the marijuana
oh that thats cocaine
what
yeah i got the idea praying to christ you know powder snow its what gives christmas snow its kick getting enough cocaine was the tricky part so we started growing our own turns out the coca plant is even hardier than the marijuana plant it can grow even when were out of season
what is wrong with you we cant have you selling this stuff in town cocaine is illegal
it is
jesus christ you cant just give people coke without them knowing we could all go to prison
hey hey its not a big deal ive been through this before hang on ill handle it dont go anywhere
legalize it legalize it
okay cocaines totally legal now
it- it is
yeah legal in seven states including this one and other states are soon to follow i told you its 2019 dawg
