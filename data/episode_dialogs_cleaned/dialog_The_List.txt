fellas fellas its- oh my god youre not gonna believe this
dude butters calm down
okay okay i was talking to pete wetchney and he said that danny chadwick said that his sister told him that the girls in our class have a list that rates every boys looks from cutest to ugliest
so who do they say is the cutest
i dunno
who do they say is the ugliest
i dont know i-its like a girl thing they wont let anybody see the list but them
they cant do that who are they to judge us on how we look
yeah you think they rate us just for looks or they take personality into account
if its just looks then i think im safe
you guys who cares if the girls make some stupid list girls make dumb lists all the time
yeah kyles right screw it we have better things to worry about
youre just saying that because you know youre gonna be very last on the list
oh please i dont think so craig chicks think im way hotter than you
you dont think they put the fat tub of lard at the bottom
no because chicks know im not fat im buff they probably put you at the bottom of the list cause you have fucked-up teeth or kenny cause hes poor
(they didnt put me at the bottom did they)
kenny face it girls dont wanna eat pop tarts for dinner every night when they get married
you dont think they said im the ugliest boy in the class do ya well if they did my parents will ground me
you guys do you really care what a bunch of girls have to say about how you rank in looks
all right bebe lets see the list
what
you know what im talking about bitch the list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class
thats not for boys to look at its a secret girl list and you cant see it
craig is on the bottom right or is it kenny cause youd be eating pop tarts for dinner if you married him
im not telling and anyway im not the list keeper nelly is and nelly will never let you look at it so there
fuck you bebe fuck it bitch
well i guess were never gonna get that list from the girls
screw that dude were guys we can out think them
all right heres what we know that chick nelly is the one whos in charge of holding the list right she apparently keeps it in a purple pee chee folder and we need a plan to get it from her this is what i call "operation cannot possibly fail"
neat-o
at 1 pm tomorrow nelly will have to walk from home ec to social studies thats our best time to strike as she makes her way through hallway 3 craig will be ready with a distraction device here when she stops and turns to craig in the hallway butters will run up and kick her in the balls
okay
once butters kicks her in the balls shell fall to the floor dropping the pee chee and kenny will swoop in from corridor 3-delta and grab the pee chee are we good
ow whatdja do that for hey whats your problem asshole
bail bail
okay our mission failed but weve learned a lot primarily that girls do not have balls
they sure dont
never mind because we are going to plan b one that i call "operation cannot possibly fail a second time" when nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground
you think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies
butters were done talkin about girls balls right now pay attention
we got it we got it
we got the list from the girls
give that back you dirty buttholes
tape it to the wall kenny jason watch the door

hey ugly
hey kyle look man it doesnt matter what people think okay you know abraham lincoln was super ugly too but look what he accomplished chin up cowboy hey whats goin on
oh not much just hanging around-
hehehe hey nice nice ears haha pizza face
butters thats not cool man he cant help how he looks
kyle i was going to suggest that maybe you should hang out with the other ugly kids in the school because if you hang out with them you wont stand out so much right cool
hey
hello
are you going to eat your pickle
could somebody toss the football back its over there next to the ugly kids
i hate coming to this school it makes me angry
yeah
sometimes i just want to burn it down burn the whole school down to the ground
no you know what screw this we arent ugly
were not
no maybe we all just need a little image change you know like a makeover
hey yeah
like you maybe you just need to let your hair down and lets see how you look without those glasses lets just put those back on
i know that song is so awesome
uh wendy could i talk to you
of course stan
just for a minute over here
you think hes gonna beg her to come back to him
this is a nice surprise i thought you were never speaking to me again
yeah well i wanna talk to you about this list you girls made
which one we make lists all the time
the one where you rated the boys looks in the class look it really messed kyle up okay how could you vote him the ugliest
well personally i didnt vote him the ugliest my vote was for eric cartman but enough of the other girls must have felt he was-
so it wasnt unanimous maybe you can just change the list
change the list do you have any idea what that would take maybe you dont understand how important list-making is to girls its not just something we do flippantly theres protocol
cant we just talk to all the girls who made the list and find out why they voted kyle last
all right ill try and get you into our next list-making meeting but it wont be easy
todays list meeting is called to order rebecca you have the floor
if it pleases and sparkles i suggest we continue deliberations on list 47d which girl has the cutest purse
rebecca moves we work on list 47d does that sparkle with all the girls
sunshine
deliberating "which girl has the cutest purse" millie has the floor
if it pleases and sparkles i would like to submit that jennifers purse is by far the cutest definitely cuter than teresas
i dont think anyone here disagrees that jennifers purse is cuter than teresas but it doesnt make it the cutest
the committee has already decided that nothing with stripes can be in the top 5 cutest purses
sunshine sparkle wendy has the floor
if it pleases and sparkles i would like to suggest that we that we reopen last weeks list for debate
whatd she say shes gotta be kidding
is she crazy
all right all right come before the rainbow railing
go ahead
aaah i was just thinking that maybe you voted a little hastily on the cutest boy
you thought you should be number one
no
let me assure you that no list is made hastily by this committee
he didnt mean that he was just saying maybe we should open it up again for discussion
i cannot by sparkle law move to have an old list investigated however if you can find recourse for such an inquiry wendy i would review it does that sparkle with all the girls
sunshine
they all laugh at me and the girls giggle behind my back unable to even glance at my disfigured face
do not burn down the school kyle
who said that
i did do you know who i am
abraham lincoln
i am abraham lincoln burning down the school will not solve your problems you think youve been cheated because you are ugly but i am here to show you otherwise come there is much to see i want you to look in here this woman is nancy pinkerton as a child she was consistently the most beautiful girl in her entire school her life as a youth was filled with praises and everything being handed to her boys told her she was special she was funny she was interesting but thats only because she was hot it wasnt until she reached age 40 when her looks started to fade that she learned she was actually about as interesting and special as a wet carrot this is the home of your new ugly friend yamal because hes ugly he gets nothing handed to him he has to work at making something of himself but that work is gonna pay off when hes an adult he will have character something that kids who are hot rarely develop like your classmate clyde now that he knows hes good-looking he doesnt have to make any effort to be special
naw rebeccas just a friend i wanna be with you now sure yeah ill buy you some shoes too
now his life will be about girls chatting with them on the phone and buying them shoes he will most likely marry very young and not realize until age 40 that hes a total douche and so you see kyle it is actually the beautiful kids that are cursed
but i cant wait to be an adult to be happy thats forever from now
you must be patient
just take me home i dont wanna be here anymore take me home
very well
kyle you need to think about what ive told you
i dont want to i dont want anybody telling me how to feel anymore
well then youre just a fucking asshole
wait a minute wait stan i think ive got something take a look at this during final deliberation of the list for cutest boy seven girls gave clyde a glitter rating of only one sparkle
i have no idea what youre talking about
it doesnt add up it is possible that rebecca made a mistake when she tallied the sunshine votes onto the final list
oh hey wendy
hey rebecca do you still have the voter cards for the list that rated the boys looks
oho wendy were done with that list
i know but i think theres been a mistake six of the girls ive talked to didnt vote clyde the cutest that means that mathematically he should have been-
all right you need to stop digging around wendy you might not like what you find just back off and stop asking questions youre getting close to a secret that i dont think you can handle let it go
that didnt sparkle with her did it
one canister of propane six cans of lighter fluid seven gallons of high-octane kerosene and a box of matches okay is that everything little boy
that should just about do it
do you like to put this on your true-value card today
nonorary chair mrs secretary i believe a member of our committee has tampered with one of our lists ive compiled a full report and it turns out that nobody voted clyde the cutest in the class i believe rebecca changed the list to make him number one
why would she do that
right after the list was made rebecca started going out with clyde you can read all the discrepancies here we need to remake that list
you just couldnt let it go
uh what do you mean call the girls in
im afraid we cant do that wendy
did you know wendy that clydes father owns the shoe store at the mall a lot of us have always wanted to date clyde to get free shoes but we couldnt because he wasnt popular enough
you knew
unfortunately the members voted clyde in the bottom five of the list thats why we had to manipulate the votes forge a new list and hide the real one
so that you all could justify dating clyde and get shoes how dare you take advantage of your position im gonna tell bebe and have you both disbarred from the list committee
bebe who do you think authorized the buyout
no not bebe
shes dating clyde now nobody loves shoes more than her
whats going on
when the other girls find out you ignored their votes theyre gonna-
do you really think theyll believe you over the heads of the committee well simply generate a new list "biggest liars" and put you at the top
do yourself a favor wendy just let it go and keep your little mouth shut
i dont think so
aagh
stan run
jesus dude
hey kid have you seen kyle weve looked everywhere and we have to show him something
hes burning down the school
what
he said he gonna burn the school down to the ground
all the cruel jokes and ridicule will finally be over are you happy now god you made me look like this
kyle kyle dont
dont try and stop me stan you dont know how it feels to be a deformed monstrosity
the list was a forgery kyle
huh
it didnt sparkle with all the girls we have the real list
thats about far enough give me that list wendy
stan what is going on
it was about shoes kyle the girls wanted shoes so they set you up
kyle was simple a casualty to move clyde meant that craig has to be moved to number twelve which moved jimmy down and moved jason up
so what number was i
youve compromised everything our lists integrity
did you see these shoes wendy theyre incredible
it doesnt matter how incredible they are you cant- oh my god those are amazing
right
is that a lace across the top
no its a little strap
wendy
oh but it doesnt matter you took it too far
if you hadnt gone all nancy drew on us this would have just gone away
shes gonna kill us
its too late bebe ive already made a full report and sent a copy to the police people will know
oh please youre lying
give it up bebe we know all about it the list was compromised kyle broflovski is not the ugliest boy in the class
wendy
(aah-)
wait i i didnt do anything wrong
you can explain all that downtown
here kyle weve been through a lot but you can finally see where you really are on the list
are you sure youre okay with this kyle
im sure abe lincoln was right i dont wanna find out im good-looking and become a total shithead when i grow up
abe lincoln
stan its been really great hanging out with you again i feel like youve changed somehow in a really awesome way
yeah well i guess a lot of things change dont they bwaaaagh bwaaaagh
