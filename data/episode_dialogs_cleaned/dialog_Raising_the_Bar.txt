more lawsuits today as people on mobility scooters claim they have nowhere to poo property owners are being ordered to modify their bathrooms costing taxpayers millions opponents of the measure are expressing their outrage by engaging in the act of rascal tipping
stop it you kids sto- oop- owww weak weak
the government warns that rascal tipping can be dangerous and may lead to fat people shitting their pants as they kick and scream on the floor to counter the crisis the department of health has called for $25 million in aid so that all mobility scooters can be fitted with a tip assist device
oh yeah its nice yeah that works pretty well
you have got to be kidding me
what kyle
we should not be wasting time and money making sure cartmans fat scooter cant be tipped over
you condone rascal-tipping kyle do you know that all over our country people in mobility scooters are being victimized
so get off your fucking scooters and pick them up
oh oh did you hear him this is exactly what adele is talking about our culture celebrates anorexia and tries to make us ashamed if we dont have slim stomachs and perky little tits like kyle well i for one am gonna stop feeling ashamed just because kyle throws up in the bathroom six times a day to make sure he looks good on his magazine covers you should be ashamed of yourself kyle eating your latkes and gefilte fish and then putting your fingers down your throat because society tells you how to look im not feeling shamed anymore from now on im gonna shop sitting down and skip to the front of the lines with my head held high just because someone needs a mobility scooter doesnt mean theyre an ignorant piece of white trash kyle i may be fat but im not honey boo boo
whos honey boo boo
dude youve never seen honey boo boo
my names honey boo boo and im a beauty queen bitches im fat as a whale and i dont give two shits girl

jesus dude w-w-what happened its like somethings lowered the bar to the point that nobody feels any shame anymore
well dude its not like the bar is this actual physical thing
this is it throttle down
throttle down
mr cameron you dont have to do this why dont you just go back to your house in malibu go work on another movie
i have to do this i have to try and raise it
the bar isnt something that actually lowers mr cameron
then how do you explain all the fat people on mobility scooters how do you account for honey boo boo the bar has been lowered to depths we cant even fathom if anyone can go down there and raise it back its me let her go uv lights on pressure system is normal music on
his name is james (james) cameron the bravest pioneerno budget too steep no sea too deep whos that its himjames cameron
systems are normal you guys hearing the song okay up there
james (james) cameron explorer of the sea
yes james we hear the song
descending to one thousand feet i dont see the bar yet looks like it must have sunk pretty low
with a dying thirst to be the first could it be yeah its him james cameron
come on hurry it up in there
oh yeah thats good thats accessible now cool let me try to take a shit in this real quick
this has gone far enough how can we make people see the difference between being sensitive to obesity and letting fat people walk all over us
yeah what we need is something to raise awareness
yeah weve gotta raise peoples awareness
something like a documentary you know follow cartman around with a video camera and then get all his bullshit on television
yeah guh a a documentary
at least then wed be voicing our concern i mean if you think about it we should feel some shame for complaining about it and not doing anything
you i gu-i guess youre kinda right
hey tell you what if you wanna follow cartman around and get a video of him ill pay to make it into a documentary and get it on the air
really thanks dude im gonna go get a video camera
hey tolkien if youre gonna get kyle to video that stuff for you you should probably tell him the truth
he doesnt need to know the truth kyle will get what he wants and so will i
ladies and gentlemen we have an epidemic in our country obesity is costing taxpayers millions and some are taking advantage of a system that is flawed over the past several days i have filmed such a case and the shocking video has been edited by my partner tolkien it is our hope that this film will cast light on a serious issue
hes chubby hes filthy and hes just a little bit nuts here he is americas newest sweetheart fatty doo doo
fatty doo doo
what
nobody scoots a fatty doo like you doscatty foo foopatty poo poowhite president black president i dont carejust scoop me up some doodoo and ill be right therei only know five chords six-
come in
what have you done
i helped you make a documentary kyle
when we said "documentary" i thought we meant 60 minutes not honey boo boo
kyle kyle im trying to make compelling television
you got randy newman to do the theme song youre not trying that hard tolkien youre a good kid how can you sit there and collect money on a show thats about a about a fat child killing himself wheres your sense of shame
i can remember exactly where i was the first time i saw honey boo boo i couldnt believe what i was seeing a shameful fat family eating white trash food to their death and then i saw what network it was on the learning channel if they can feel okay about that why cant i
when the bar gets lowered tolkien we all pay the price what if honey boo boo was a little black girl being fattened up by her mom and talking about grits and hominy
but shes not black kyle shes white the bar is determined by society kyle and its not something that can just be raised up not by us or anyone else
you guys seeing this
yes we see mr cameron
this is where the bar was just a few years ago it was lowered here when president clinton got a blow job in the oval office and suddenly men who were just getting blow jobs in alleyways thought they werent all that bad but clearly something else has lowered the bar even more i must go deeper were in the pipe five by five
i just dont know what to do i mean i hate cartman with all my heart but i cant stop feeling ashamed for taking advantage of him but should i feel ashamed oh whatever lowered the bar is not my fault so if i kind of go with it is it really unfair to cartman
i guess not but what is it exactly youre trying to do
just you know make some money off him like honey boo boo
dude dude not cool
what
havent you heard what happened honey boo boos heart gave out
what oh my god
