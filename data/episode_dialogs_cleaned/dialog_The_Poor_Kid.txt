pabst blue ribbon and white trash its a deadly combination that can lead to prison time and children being taken away from their home this white trash home in colorado seems innocent enough

right there are two bedrooms upstairs boys room and girls room your chores are listed on their respective doors follow you will eat only at designated meal times beverages you may take from the refrigerator as you like however in this house you will drink only agnostic beverages dr pep-er and diet dr pep-er because what flavor is it it is neither root beer nor cola nobody is sure what flavor it is and nobody can be sure isnt that right melissa
i dont know
good
this is awesome butters you really think you got something
yep to find out who the poorest kid is i actually was able to see which kids in school got those coupons they hand out for school lunch
eh yeah
so then i cross-referenced all the kids who were on half-priced lunches with the tax records of people in town to see which kids parents actually made the least amount of money last year
heh heh yeah
well actually eric its you
what
now that kennys gone your household actually has the lowest income im sorry pal
oh my god if we found this out its only a matter of time before everybody else does

wha dude do you think this is funny
we just - no we just like to have fun here
well ill tell you somethin being from a low-income household isnt funny oh heell no my mommas so poor she opened a gmail account just so she could eat the spam

dude my mommas so poor when she gets mad she cant afford to fly off the handle so shes gotta go greyhound off the handle
two penn state administrators walk into a butt-
jesus this is a long drive are we in hawaii yet
hawaii

your foster home is here pretty much the exact opposite of hawaii
what greeley

(what the fuck are you doing here)
hello eric your room is upstairs on the left are you hungry
youre my new mom
you can call me mom if you like
alright mom how much money do you make like gross yearly income after taxes
this is where youll sleep with your foster brothers you will be clean polite and most importantly you will follow the agnostic code we cannot know with certainty if god or christ exists they could then again there could be a giant reptilian bird in charge of everything can we be certain there isnt no so its pointless to talk about now say it with me
goddamn ive gotta sleep in a room with six other people how poor are we
hey we do not take the lords name in vain in this house just in case there is one do you understand or do you need the punishment room
oh heell naw mom dads being mean to me mem meem
my name is not meom
oh god im so nervous these kids all seem kind of mean
ill see you at recess right
(ill be there karen)
youve already been here awhile kenny so you have to introduce me to your friends okay and make sure they know im kewl youve gotta have my back kenny
oh hey kenny whos this
(this is eric cartman)
does he live with you at the foster home
okay alright so listen i know our family is poor okay but before we lived there kenny was actually poorer than me so technically hes the poorest kid at this school
what are you talking about the poor kid in this school is jacob hallery

(uh huh)
lets put our hands up everyone cept for jacob his mom is so poor she only understands hand-outs
eric at greeley elementary we do not tolerate students making fun of other students
i wasnt making fun of anybody
a twenty-minute song and dance number with forty seven "yo momma so poor" jokes directed at jacob hallery which ended in a finale with fireworks
i was just teasing
your case worker has been notified and he is not happy
my case worker oh not this guy
i know this is a difficult adjustment for you eric but you cant just turn all your frustrations on a little kid who cant defend himself i mean what do you think this is the shower room at penn state im kidding we like to have fun in our department so i was like i was like "what is this like the shower room at penn state" i joke around this is my head shot
will you stop with the penn state jokes all youre doing is taking something topical and revamping old catholic jokes
oh oh and "your momma" jokes are better theyve been around since the 50s
what the hell does this have to do with anything
principal youve gotta send help to the playground theyre about to beat up that new kid
aww look at the new kid and her wittle dolly you gonna cry some more in class wimp
l-leave her alone
shut up you foster twerps are all the same come on hand over the doll who the hell is this
how about you find another little girl to pick on
mind your business peter pan
karen mccormick is off limits do you understand make sure everybody in this school knows
and if this food comes as a gift from some divine intelligence we understand that an intelligent being cannot blame us for questioning its existence nobody knows nobody can know if any deity is watching over us amen
except for karens guardian angel
what
where did he take you after he saved you karen
he just took me back to my classroom then he disappeared like always
what have we told you about making up angel stories
but we saw him he leaped down from the sky
and he kicked the crap out of jessica pinkerton
stop it children we do not speak such certainties in this house
get down to the basement all of you its time for the punishment room
aaaaaaah
now did you see an angel
no i - no - i didnt see an angel
no you cant be certain of that you mightve seen one hit him with the dr pep-er again are there such things as angels
maybe
good
what do we do kenny kenny
what is the meaning of life
its impossible to knoooow
thats right
who could that be
mr and mrs weatherhead i received some disturbing news that all youre providing the foster children here to drink is soda
haha i told on you mom and dad
what business is that of yours
its my business because child protective services is accountable for these kids have i given you my head shot
yes yes we have that
okay now are you only giving these kids dr pepper to drink
if we want to serve agnostic beverages in this house then by goddish well do it the children youve sent here are undisciplined and talking about the certainty of angels
excuse me lets have a look around
what the who did this
what is that
it was like a little mystery person flying around
almost like some kind of agnostic angel
oh my god whats going on here
we dont know we cant possibly know
what have i done i took you kids from your parents without even checking into where you were going i put innocent children into a dangerous environment what am i a recruitment coach for penn state its not funny
theres nothing in there but dr pepper right there cant be
ohhh

you have the right to remain silent now look at the camera and say "im white trash and im in trouble"
im white trash and im in trouble
get in the car you
wait a minute im white trash and im in trouble
no no take all these kids back to their parents weve embarrassed the system and made it something nobody wants to be a part of its like a penn state homecoming party
a false police report can carry up to a two-month prison term son
im not saying it
we can do this the easy way or we can do it hard
im not saying it
then well add another charge for resisting
okay fine im white trash and im in trouble
three arrests in just one power-packed episode proving once again that we are all just one pabst blue ribbon away from becoming white trash in trouble sponsored by schlitz
well it sure is good to have you back kenny
(thanks stan)
i hear your parents might give up selling meth for good
(good for me)
