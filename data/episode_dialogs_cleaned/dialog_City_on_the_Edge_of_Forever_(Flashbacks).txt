just keep your trap shut ill consult the manual
ms crabtree
shut up kiid i have to watch a training video
welcome to tape 7 of the bus drivers video guidebook what to do if you become stranded by now youve calmed down the children and kept order by using the keep quiet or ill kill the bunny technique now its time to get help the most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus so do not under any circumstances let any children off the bus the best way to achieve this is to tell them something like a big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus
kiids do not get off this bus if you do a big scary monster will eat you
thats right with the children properly subdued you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance and remember your bus drivers code sit down and shut up
im goin for help ahll be back as soon as i can remember dont get off this bus or a big scary monster will eat you
hey why doesnt the scary monster eat her
cause dombass scary monsters dont eat big fat smelly bitches

what do ya mean how often does an entire third-grade class go missing
well 99% of the time when a child is missing its because theyve run away mkay
run away
oy i knew i shouldnt have made kyle eat that gefukahukah
how do we get our runaway children back
well we just need to make some posters nkay hand out brochures onkay that way the public can know what the chldren look like and can call in if thryre spotted mkay
lets get started right away they could be halfway to l a by now
its only a matter of time before theyre selling their bodies and buying smack
come on everybody
weve got to find those kids
if we all put our heads together we can find them
we can do it
