people its time we faced some hard truths the town is looking to us for answers and all we keep doing is burying our heads we need to cut the budget for this years christmas pageant
my god
ive asked the director of the holiday show to stop by so we can all give him the news
hes not going to take this well
if he doesnt we should just let him go god knows its about time
hey a lot of people like him all right
yeah and a lot of people think he stinks
lets just get this over with all right send him in
hooooowwwdy ho you wanted to see me better hurry we only have two months before christmas
mr hankey we called you in to let you know that your christmas pageant funding has been cut by half
what but i can barely make a good christmas show with what i have
we just dont have the support for the christmas show that we used to the truth is some people find you offensive
offensive what about me is offensive
some people think shit isnt the best representation of christmas
yuh you people cant do this christmas is the most magical time of the year
the decision has already been made thank you mr hankey and good luck with the show
okay stop kids the songs called "deck the halls" not "lets all suck balls" mow come on kids
why do we have to do this now
yeah its not even halloween yet
restoration hardware put up their christmas decorations two weeks ago all right now listen i didnt want this either i wanted the denver symphony but they cut my budget and im stuck with you now lets take it from the top
vice principal strong woman
yes pc principal
i was seeing if theres anything you might want to discuss with me
what would we need to discuss
i am- so sorry- that i took advantage of my position and- manipulated you into a physical encounter
hey i am a strong woman all right i dont get manipulated we both are guilty of an ill-advised relationship at the workplace but that was long ago and i have decided to move forward
are you sure we can move forward
why not we make a mistake we move forward
i was just thinking there might still possibly be some fallout from-
nope were just gonna forget about it and put it to rest
you dont think theres anything else to dis- to discuss
no i dont bye-bye
dude kyle dude
dude
what
did you read what mr hankey tweeted last night
what mr hankey tweeted
yeah i guess after band rehearsals he went on twitter to talk about us
look
oh jesus christ dude
santa claus is on his way hes loaded goodies on his sleighhell drop them off on christmas day
mr hankey
oh kyle hoowwwwdy ho
mr hankey everyones really mad at you were you on twitter last night
yeah
did you tweet "the kids of south park are retarded homos who cant play music"
yeah
why would you tweet that all the kids are really pissed off
it was a bad attempt at a joke im sorry will you tell the kids i didnt mean it
what do you want me to say
the fact is i couldnt sleep last night so i took some ambien do you take that stuff it turns your brain into oatmeal please kyle tell the kids i didnt mean any harm weve gotta focus on christmas
all right everyone listen up the vice principal has asked to speak with you today she believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization
thats right kids many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives they can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown persons sperm in a lab
thats right strong woman in todays society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man
ooohhhhhhh
st-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "whos the father"
oh ooohhhhhhh
you- you all right strong woman
im fine
so-so wed like to have all our students talk to their parents tonight about in-vitro fertilization and after that lets just put the whole issue behind us
thats my water breaking not a big deal
christmas time its christmas time christmas time yeah its christmas time
hankey we need to talk about what you tweeted
oh im sooo sorry i took ambien two nights ago and i called the schoolkids homos
no im talking about what you tweeted last night "the city council members are a bunch of pussy-licking islamists"
oh-oh jeez did i say that listen if youre tired and you cant sleep do not take ambien okay whew
im afraid we have no option but to fire you as executive planning manager of the city council
fire me nonono please i-im really sorry no no wait wait please give me another chance dont do this what about christmas
its okay well be at the hospital soon just keep breathing
i didnt need your help
im just a co-worker helping another co-worker in need
yeah well people might get the wrong idea i have worked my whole life to be the strongest woman possible a person little girls could look up to if those girls thought i was the type to get knocked up by my boss-
i certainly do not want to put an pressures on you as a female but at times i wonder if there is more we should discuss
theres nothing to discuss i made a mistake and i am moving forward
my civil rights are under attack they cant just fire me from the christmas show the whole thing is my creation
uh last night you tweeted "the city council can suck my mexican dick"
it was a joke look at me i dont even have a dick get it okay okay look i know it wasnt a good joke but it really wasnt my fault the fact is i went home last night and i was angry i couldnt sleep so i took some ambien and then i started tweeting ambien messes with my head you ever take that crap
you want us to take this up against ambien they have the best lawyers in the world
well i thought maybe i could get them in a defecation lawsuit rrrgh
and i never ever would have said those things about the city council but the ambien makes me kind of blackout
im sorry sir but we dont represent pieces of shit
why not rrrgh
and i just thought maybe we could convince the city council to hire me back
look im sorry but i learned a long time ago that if you defend poop you get stained
mr hankey
oh kyle howwwdy ho
what are you doing here
just tryin to find some help there isnt a lawyer in town who will take me wait a minute you youre the son of a lawyer you have lawyer blood inside your veins you can help me with my defecation lawsuit kyle

please kyle youre the only person left who can help me you and me pal we are gonna fight the system
paging dr bender

that she is
the quintuplets are all healthy and resting away there are her babies right there
oh dude bro
yes cute little buggers arent they three boys and two girls
i think its wrong to force gender specification upon them at this young age
funny thats exactly what their mother said the quints are all caucasian blue-eyed and something kind of weird
whats that
well the babies are all extremely pc the likes of which i have never seen watch this three black guys walk into a bar its okay its okay they left they left
doctor would it be possible for me to hold the pc babies
oh im sorry thats only for the mother and father though according tot he vice principal the father doesnt even exist

(what)
how to get mr hankey another chance theres by-laws in the city council that community service leaders cant be terminated without a hearing i need you guys there as character witnesses
nnnope

look i was the one who abused my position and took advantage of a subordinate-
nobody took advantage of me
n-not took advantage you know what im saying
and im a strong woman
all i want to do is help we can say im the manny and if anyone has a problem with that then they have a problem with gender biases and they can take it up with me we can keep the truth about the babies totally hidden
oh yes that curriculum should be fine for the students ill start working on an all-school proposal
oh yes very good vice principal see that it is done by back to school night
a-hall right mommy your little bundles of joy are here oh and whos this
i am the manny anyone have a problem with that
no not at all
everything good here aw are these pc babies
and now live from the town courthouse its the hankey hearing on south park 13
mr hankey- fourteen hours ago did you or did you not say "everyone in south park is a god-damned douchebag"
y-es that was a bad attempt at a christmas joke

thats what i said it was a bad attempt
what part of the statement was actually-
you wanna hear a good christmas joke
in 2005 you said- you said that you had no recollection of a-
sorry i got the sniffles

hey hey careful youre upsetting the pc babies
the pc what-listen christmas season means peace on earth and good will towards men all right all right look what what is the holiday season about its about loving each other right loving and- what what are they crying about now
sometimes pc babies dont even know what theyre crying about
well then tell the babies to shut the fuck up who the fuck brings a goddamned baby to a christmas show anyway
mr hankey stop
lemme go kyle these people are idiots
mommy something stinks
yeah like shit

uh huh 2018
kyle listen it was 3 am last night and i still hadnt slept so i de- kyle kyle please theyre gonna run me out of town kyle theyre going to erase me and everything i ever did
you want them to erase me too
kyle we can all be shitty sometimes
uh
theyre so strong like their mother
theyre so pc like whoever their father is well never keep them quiet our only hope is to keep them hidden
can they ever know that im their dad
we did the most un-pc thing imaginable think about what that would do to them we can never let them know the debaucherous sickening circumstances that brought them into this world
then ill just try to be the best principal to them that i possibly can
and ill be their strongest vice principal and hopefully the world will calm down and not do anything to upset them
today south park says goodbye to mr hankey the longtime union of this town and the holiday figure is over for good we should all feel pretty great about ourselves give ourselves a little nice pat on the back as we as a society continue to try and sweep away all the poop
well everyone i guess this is goodbye it sure has been swell
no goodbyes mr hankey you just need to go we already called you a poober
a poober they have that oh you mean lyft well okay goodbye everyone i hope i brought a few smiles and a few laughs into your hearts
goodbye mr hankey
where will he go
hell have to find a place that accepts racist awful beings like him there are still places out there who dont care about bigotry and hate
hoowwwwdy ho
cool man talking crap
welcome my friend please rest your weary feet and make yourself at home here
hooray
