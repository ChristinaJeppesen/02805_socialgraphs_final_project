alright everyone listen up today were going to be showing you some art from our asian-american students-dammit leslie shut your fucking pie-hole from our asian-american students presented by our student-body president wendy testaburger
hey guys as you know we have several new students here at south park elementary we have been getting to know some of the asian girls who have introduced us to an art style called "yaoi" yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty involving two people whose love is looked down upon the art tries to show that all love is magical like in lisa akimotos piece "tweek and craig - forbidden love"
awwww
what
kelly zhou goes a bit more whimsical with "craig and tweek moonlight dance"
awwww
dude what the fuck
in yaoi art the seme or "top" is usually dominating the uke or "bottom" as demonstrated in heather nishimuras "boizu rabu"
awwww
but yaoi can branch out to other things as well
uh oh
as we see here in "lily frog tweek and craig"
i just dont get it i mean tweek and craig arent gay right
no we would know
well but then why would asian girls draw them like that
yeah what is this yaoi thing all about i am so c-c-c-confused
and if it can happen to tweek and craig could it happen to any of us
uhh excuse me why are you doing this
"oh hi craig 오늘 다른 셔츠 입었네 (hes wearing a different shirt today)
잠바 밑에 어떻게 알아 (how do you know whats underneath his jacket)
what well what did she say
i dont know that was korean im japanese
what is going on huh huh me and him arent together why is this happening
지금 크렉이 같이 있어줘야 하는데"
everyone thinks im gay what if my parents find out huh
alright guys i know there have been a lot of rumors flyin around just wanted to check in see if you have any questions for me
why are the asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay
whats wrong with being gay nothin wrong with that
but we arent im not
im not either
that is completely irrelevant okay what matters and the reason i brought you in here is that you understand affirmative consent
whats that
if there is a romantic relationship here you have to make sure your partner is comfortable with any sexual exploration
gah
now in a gay relationship it gets a little trickier but you still have to follow some guidelines alright
but im not gay
i dont care about that bro tweek if and im only saying if at some point you wanted to touch craigs penis you cant just go grabbin for it alright you need to say something like "craig is it alright with you if i touch your penis" okay lets try it out
no
you want two weeks detention instead this shits important
craig can i touch your penis
okay good now craig you might say "you may touch my penis im comfortable with that" or of course you could say "no you may not touch my penis at this time"
no you may not
okay now were getting somewhere now craig what would you say if you wanted to take a gander at tweeks asshole
randy you should have a talk with stan
for what
i guess something happened at school today involving two of stans friends being gay
what
yeah stan seems really perplexed
wow our town has only had a whole foods for three weeks and we already have our first gay kids so cool
go talk to him randy and be delicate
hey bud hows it hangin
im confused dad there was this thing at school
well guess what youve got a really progressive pc dad who knows all about this stuff okay go ahead ask me anything
i just dont understand how its decided
ah well you see its a combination of genetic hormonal and environmental influences
no i mean like what makes the asians decide who theyre gonna make gay
the asians the asians decide whos going to be gay uh are y- yeah yeah they do uh the asians just you know the asians pick who they pick and um its al- its the way its always been
so youve heard of yaoi
yeah of course yaoi anal intercourse maui zaui i i know all this stuff stan

theres no stopping it the whole world wants me to be something im not
me too dude but theres something we can do
what
we have to come out and say were gay
what are you insane the way everyone-
wait wait because if were gay we can break up and if we break up no more pictures we just have to stage a fake breakup in front of the asian girls
like acting no man that is way too much pressure ill fail-
you can do it tweek youre capable of more than you think
agh im a terrible actor
you just follow my lead and try and make it believable okay
oh gah-okay oh god
what did i do wrong huh everyones so damned happy but but why did this have to happen to my son what did i do to make my son like this
hey hey whoa you didnt do anything
oh what you know about this
yeah let me handle thisk guys im pc look thomas you need to understand that being gay isnt a decision you know a lot of people think that asians decide whos gay and whos not but it isnt all asians its just specifically the japanese okay
what
why do the japanese make some people gay and others not well it all goes back to world war ii and atrocities that happened in china called the rape of don king
hey you sure know a lot about this
yes i do
no dude i looked it up yaoi is just an art style for girls by girls because they like fictionalizing two guys in a relationship
but why
i dont know but the point is theres nothing about it that means tweek and craig are actually gay at all
hey tweek hold up listen its just not going to work
what why not
im sorry tweek but we cant lie to ourselves anymore yes we are gay but we do not belong together
we dont belong together what suddenly changed craig
its just that people are different thats all
uh huh and who the hell is michael huh you wanna tell me that
what what are you what are you talking about
i went through your phone when we went out last night craig i saw your texts to michael about hooking up with him
wait uh thats thats not what happened
oh its not
no uh look we both know this is for the better
oh dont use that lame shit on me man you dont wanna feel bad so you try and tell me what i want
wait dont make me out to be the bad guy here
noho youre not the bad guy youre never the bad guy are you you you just step on people and you use them
youre going too far dude this is like totally not necessary
agh-im going too far what is wrong with you
this wasnt part of the plan
well guess what craig love doesnt follow a plan
yeah
i was totally wrong about you i opened myself up and let you in but youve got spikes man youve got spikes
tweek
dude seriously seriously
they they broke up
what are you doing this place isnt you
im just here to pick up on guys why are you jealous
no im not im here because we need you right now
oh now you need me huh fuck you dude
fuck you
what is that kid doing here
hes just kind of talking to himself
the whole town is sad cupid me you have to help
well i guess i could try now in return for just one date
im not homosexual
then i guess im not interested
ugh alright one date but only if you help get tweek and craig back together
teeheehee teeheeheeheehee
hey kid what do you think youre doing here
oh hey whoa whoa-whoa-whoa im not here for me im here for my friend okay
hi is craig here sir
why cant you quit him
thomas
five minutes hes in the back
hey dude
what do you want
i thought when we broke up everything would get better i was thinking maybe we should say were back together
dude im not gay and neither are you
what does that have to do with anything
you think you can just pull that shit you pulled at school saying i step on people and use them and ill just take you back
you said to make it seem real
not that real now everyone thinks im a manipulative cheater ill never get any chicks
im so sorry craig you you made me believe in myself in a way i never have before i didnt think i had any of that in me but you were right i can do more than i think you changed something in me and i just i wanna fix whatevers hurting you now
i cant be something because everyone wants me to be i have to be myself youll just have to go be gay with someone else
alright craig alright
i can see how much theyre both hurting but cant you understand that in my time we just didnt accept this maybe its not so wrong i i just dont want it to be my son
you just need a little prick of magic and ill pee in your mouth a little bit
then again hes my son no matter what i cant just shut down on him
teeheeheehee teeheeheehee
son you need to listen to me you cant fight being gay i used to think that being gay was a choice but you dont get to decide japan picks who they pick and thats that i dont understand this stuff heck i didnt even know don king got raped but i do know that if you try and resist it you make yourself miserable your whole life everyone was so proud of you ah i was just being selfish i wanna be proud of you too i like gay craig i love you heres a hundred dollars
maybe we should go away put cares aside for just a day
the world we face is a-not so bignot if we are strong like tweek and craig
hontou ni sakana ga oishii
