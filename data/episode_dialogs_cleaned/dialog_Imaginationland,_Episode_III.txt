imaginationland used to be a happy place but then the terrorists attacked and so many of us were killed the barrier came down and all the most evil imaginary characters were unleashed now our final battle will take place the evil characters are marching toward us with the intent to wipe us all out
this is gonna be fun huh
we prepare for a battle we cannot win sweet and cuddly imaginary characters many who have never held a weapon must now fight for their very lives we are too few in number but we have one hope that is where you come in young boy only you can help us win this battle

hello hello anybody
stan
hello
stan
good morning kyle how are we feeling
cartman whats happened
whats happened well lets see you bet me that i couldnt prove that leprechauns were real and if i could prove it you had to suck my balls i believe
no i mean what happened at the pentagon
you just rest kyle look what i made for you a sundae it has hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry- but i feel like something is missing dont you kyle what else belongs on a sundae besides hot fudge and whipped cream lets see
arh
hot fudge whipped cream what else belongs on a sundae kyle what else goes on a sundae besides hot fudgewhipped cream and oh thats right my balls
cartman what is going on out there what happened to stan
oh he got sucked through that portal thing and theyre gonna nuke it now so are you all set for your big photo shoot kyle
wwait what do you mean stans in danger
dont try to change the subject kyle youve done a really good job of getting out of this bet but its finally time to settle get ready for your sundae kyle with extra nuts
aslan the evil characters are almost here
get everyone to the battlefield defend the castle walls quickly young boy we need your powers now
what powers ah i dont understand
you are real you are a creator that means you can imagine things into existence here
i c-i can
santa claus was killed in the terrorist attack the first thing we need is for you to bring him back
how
you just have to focus your mind imagine santa and nothing else
how am i supposed to focus with all this crap goin on
think only of one thing imagine it believe in it
whatever is most prominent in your mind will come to be
butters you are grounded mister you hear me grounded
aaaaaaaaa no nonono no no no
what are you doing we need santa
im trying
come on kid imagine santa believe in santa
you must believe in santa
believe in santa right now
gaa haa
kevin can i get some more bounce off that too kay lets just go with a 5 6 8 split
cartman will you shut up im trying to find out whats going on
a new terrorist attack seems to have taken place this time in our imagination al gore brought this video to the publics attention sparking demands by everyone who wants to know exactly whats going on
we were hoping to keep this quiet until it was all over but two days ago there was a terrorist attack on our imagination and now our imaginations are running wild
our imaginations are running wild and we werent told
by attacking our imagination the terrorists have found our most vulnerable spot and weve determined that the best course of action is to nuke our imagination
is nuking our imagination really prudent
arent there other more peaceful ways to get our imagination under control
couldnt we trying sending kurt russell into a portal to our imagination to try and reason with the-
we tried that and kurt russell was raped by christmas critters
a-ooch
the pentagon claims that because imaginary things are not real the military doesnt need senate approval to nuke them
thats bullcrap man you cant nuke our imagination
dont nuke our imagination bro wooo
mike does the military have the authority to nuke our imagination
uh clearly they dont steven and theyre gonna have a big problem because state government has already set a precedent that imaginary characters are real i cite a famous case of cartman v broflovski in which a us court found for the plaintiff who saw a leprechaun
yes i believe the defendant had to suck the plaintiffs balls in that case
thats right steven yeah
oh for the love of god
hello can anybody hear me
stan dude is that you
kyle where are you i i dont see you
no im not there im at a hospital i im hearing you in my imagination
oh that makes sense
dude whats happening
im in like a gumdrop forest i just saw strawberry shortcake tied up and dead with pee in her eye ha-hang on i think something really big is about to go down
the evil characters are here
there are so many of them haaaaa
theres no time left you have to get control of your imagination and bring santa back now
santa saaanta
think jolly old santa red suit white beard
red suit white beard ssssanta
how does that look can you see my balls and the sundae in frame
a shocking new development in the nuking of imagination
the supreme court has ruled with the military that imaginary things are officially not real and therefore no approval is needed to nuke them
thank you
oh no
this of course overturns any imagination-based verdicts in the past including the famous cartman v broflovski ballsucking case
what
so it appears the military is ready to proceed with its operation one they are calling "operation nuke the imagination through the imagination doorway"
kyle whats happening
the government is gonna nuke imaginationland
what you cant let them do that
what am i supposed to do
dude you have to stall them uh- uh oh what is that hey g-get out of here leave me alone
stan stan
where are you going
im going to try to save stan and butters from getting nuked
okay okay but you you have to suck my balls first real quick
no i dont the decision was overturned
we had a deal kyle
yeah that leprechauns were real and the government just declared they arent technically real so i was right its over i dont have to suck your balls
it isnt over it isnt over kyle i have not waited this long to see you weasel your way out of this bet go ahead and go but i swear on my life before this day is over you will suck my balls i swear it
i need more spinach for popeye
i-ee got one i got him
hey there
were losing the battle there are simply too many of them
then the day is lost
wait aslan look
what what happened
you did it kid
quickly santa they need you on the battlefield
huh oh all right make way for santa
now you see your potential young creator but there is still much more we need from you if we are to win this day
this area is restricted little boy
please i need to talk to the people inside they cant set off that nuke
get behind the line with the other protesters
no nukes in our imagination bro wooo
uhn you dont understand my friend is in imaginationland i can hear him in my head
you pot-smokin hippies arent gettin through here so back off
stop that nuke
stop that nuke
stop that nuke
whats going on here the military has to do this its their only way to kill manbearpig
good butters now imagine some more archers on the castle walls
huwhoa
aslan were losing the battle
we managed to fight off the vampires and werewolves but now our troops are being shot down by the cavity creeps
cavity creeps
we make holes in teeth we make holes in teeth
what can destroy the cavity creeps
only crest gel with tartar control
quickly you must imagine a giant crest gel
yes
his powers are getting stronger we might just have a chance here
aslan weve captured a spy he was sneaking around the gumdrop forest
stan hey look i imagined stan here
no no i got sucked through operation imagination doorway at the pentagon
project imagination doorway
never mind the battle is almost won we can deal with him later
no no you dont understand theres a nuke the government is about to level this entire place
what
wull why would they nuke imaginationland
so the terrorists cant ever use it against us again
we can get imaginationland under control the chosen one just needs more time
the chosen one
yeah it turns out im the key
missile launch sequence initiated
all right people i want this nuking done by the books
sir we have a security breach
what
theres an unauthorized entry alert sir-its coming from sector two
sector 2
what the hell do you think youre doing declaring leprechauns arent real
what
you just cant declare that imaginary things arent real who are you to say whats real think about it is blue real is love really real
imaginary things are things made up by people like santa and rudolph
yeah and they detract from real things like jesus
maybe jesus is imaginary too
ooooh youd better not say that youll go to hell
its possible that hell is also imaginary
uh so then were about to nuke hell thats a good thing right
hell yeah thats a good thing yeah
what if heaven is imaginary wed be nuking heaven
yeah but it wouldnt be real
so itd be all right
look maybe theyre all part of the same thing santa and jesus and hell and- leprechauns maybe theyre all real in the same wway right
santa claus and leprechauns are imaginary but jesus and hell are real
well then what about buddha
well of course hes imaginary
awww see now youre being intolerant tom
am i real
all right enough keep that kid out of the way and lets get back to the nuking at hand
no leprechauns are real goddammit
kyle kyle what happened
nothing
what
nothing happened theres nothing i can do
dude you cant let the government fire off that nuke
they say they can do whatever they want because imaginary things arent real
well you have to convince them they are real
no way dude then id have to suck cartmans balls
whatever it takes you have to do it all right hang- hang on kyle jesus wants to talk to you
huh
hello kyle this is jesus
oh boy
what seems to be the problem my child
jesus i cant do anything im just a fourth grader going against the entire government uh hello jesus
no eh hey kyle this is luke skywalker
aah
look i know this seems like an impossible task but do you remember when i brought down the death star i m i mean that seemed impossible too right
yeah i guess
uh okay now now hold on because superman is here and he wants to say something
kyle this is superman
hi superman
i know that saving people can be a big responsibility but no matter what it takes its worth it
i know
you can do this kyle how hang on because hercules wants to talk to you
oh god
yes god is here too hes gonna talk to you right after captain crunch
popeye i need some help here
popeye is being killed by christmas critters
gaw guguh getskug off of me
hey what is that
more spinach for popeye imagine an m60 for jesus
all right
the boy is doing it everything is going to be okay
missile launch in one minute
goddamnit you stupid assholes are going to ruin everything
prepare for launch
sir we have a security breach
what
theres an unauthorized entry alert sir-its coming from sector two
sector 2
kyle
the hell are you doing back here
listen you dont have to do this our imaginations arent running wild anymore
why is it so easy for children to break into the pentagon
you have to stop
if im not mistaken youre the one who bet that leprechauns werent real so why do you care what happens
because i- i um because i think they are real its all real think about it havent luke skywalker and santa claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room i mean whether jesus is real or not he hes had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have and the same could be said of bugs bunny and a-and superman and harry potter theyve changed my life changed the way i act on the earth doesnt that make them kind of "real" they might be imaginary but but theyre more important than most of us here and theyre all gonna be around long after were dead so in a way those things are more realer than any of us
abort the sequence
so kyle imaginary things are real huh guess that means i did win the bet after all and you know what that means kyle
just let it go with your fucking balls you fucking asshole your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet well ive decided cartman even if we had a bet that i am never sucking your balls you got that they can throw me in jail for the rest of my life but i am never going to suck your balls never so there
what happened why hasnt the missile gone off
theres been an abort mr gore
no manbearpig has to die
oh jesus no
thats it aslan the evil characters have fled
the day is ours
