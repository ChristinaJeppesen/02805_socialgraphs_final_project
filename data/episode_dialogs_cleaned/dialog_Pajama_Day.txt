whats going on here students
i ask them for a response and nothing first they just sit there when i need their focus and their energy and when i ask them–
hey you kids know that these teachers are doing their very best for your benefit
i dont know how much more i can take of this
i am sick and tired of students thinking they can walk all over their teachers who gave you everything they got
ive got enough problems as it is
i tell you what else this friday for pajama day at school this class does not get to wear their pajamas you heard me no pajama day for this class now maybe youll remember to have some respect for your teacher
this is bullshit they cant take our pajamas from us who does the principal think he is
after everything weve been through the past couple years theyre gonna take pajama day from us too

yup
whoa whoa whoa wait we are not just going to stand for this
what else can we do brah
brah we can have some goddamn balls what does matt damon say on that bitcoin commercial fortune favors the brave
my dad says that he listened to matt damon and lost all his money

yeah
some kids want to speak with you about pajama day
alright send em in
mr principal sir can we please wear our pajamas on pajama day
im sorry ladies ive made a decision and im sticking to it
mr principal we really didnt do anything wrong
i appreciate your sentiment but as principal of the school its my job to make decisions and stand by them to maintain order
do you know how long weve waited for pajama day you cant force us to wear normal clothes what is this nazi germany
hey how many times have i told you kids not to bring up nazi germany when you dont get something you want
youre a fascist
get out
youre a fascist and this whole school stinks of nazis
i cant believe the things these students say sometimes
you better quit while youre ahead
what
you dont understand how important pajama day is to kids its like the met gala for children
if i change my mind now i look weak
mmkay but i dont think this is gonna end up the way you want it to
hey look its eric cartman
eric eric its okay whats wrong
panting] oh god i-i was at the school and it– it was pajama day and i– i didnt have pajamas on and then i died and then i died
shh eric eric its okay sweetie shh
yes hello ms cartman this is the school principal returning your call what can i do for you
uh yes i understand that you told my child that he isnt allowed to wear pajamas this friday what is this nazi germany
your son is part of a class that lost their pajama day privilege correct
well im sorry but i dont think its safe for eric to not wear his pajamas on pajama day he could die
well ive already made my decision and its final
well im not really sure where you get off telling me what my son can and cant wear what do you think about that
yeah get em mom tell him to fuck off
in fact i think you can fuck off
ms cartman if you are worried about your sons safety then perhaps you should just keep him home for pajama day
uh i can just keep him home on pajama day
no i cant stay home because you have to go to work because fucking matt damon told you fortune favors the brave and now you lost all your fucking money
matt damon told me fortune favors the brave and i lost all my fucking money
im sorry
im going to rally all the parents and im going to the press if my son cant wear his pajamas to school then no kids are going to wear their pajamas to school
fuck yes mom that was fucking sweet wait no i want to wear my fucking pajamas to school you fucked it up mom
tom guten tag and heil hitler apparently we are living in nazi germany the elementary school behind me is telling some students they cant wear their pajamas to pajama day the principal of the school says the students are being reprimanded for bad behavior but many parents are left wondering nehmen sie meinen schlafanzug the schools mandate has caused a backlash with members of the community who are now wearing their pajamas to work in protest
pajama time
making a difference can be fun
testaburger
oh fuck
i need to talk to you now
yes
ms testaburger i need you to get me out of this
sir
i made a tactical decision now if i go back and say maybe i was wrong i look weak
well mr principal if you just–
zip it i need you to get everyone in your class to work together and have mr garrison come to me saying your pajama day should be reinstated you get the girls and the boys to work together this is your problem now testaburger
hey guys– i just wanna say im really proud to be a part of this office wearing our pajamas shows that we care about those school kids– that we care about other people south park realtors
south park realtors
hey guys– sorry im a little late got a flat tire on the interstate whats the latest news
whats going on mike
well what do you mean
youre not wearing pajamas
oh– yeah– i-i didnt really wanna wear pajamas
were all wearing pajamas
yeah i just didnt want to with the rain and slush outside it just didnt make any sense to wear pajamas
uh mike were trying to do the right thing and it only works if we all wear pajamas
well you cant force me to wear pajamas what is this nazi germany
we arent telling you to wear pajamas– he walks over and opens the door] but im pretty sure this sign right here on the door says you have to wear pajamas
hey mike just put on some pajamas its not a big deal
good if its not a big deal then ill choose not to wear pajamas
you redneck gun toting piece of shit
ladies and gentlemen we have been at war for too long yesterday wendy testaburger came to me and said we need to get the boys and girls together to find a solution for pajama day i was delighted we must put our differences aside because we all want one thing the right to be in our jam jams this friday all cozy wozy
its comfy womfy
comfy womfy cozy wozy the point is we are getting fucked
we all have to be on the same page here
thats right we need all of us boys and girls working together and so together what are we going to do
we could shoot up the school
shoot up the school nice its just done a lot anything a little more original
we burn down the cafeteria
we smear human shit on all the windows
we apologize you guys want a chance to save pajama day then join us in telling mr garrison were all sorry
we didnt fucking do anything
at school tomorrow we all tell mr garrison he was right and that weve been terrible students that we werent listening and that he deserves to be angry with us we tell him how much we care and that we want to see him more as a human being than just a teacher
that is just the kind of manipulative psychotic thinking that we needed
we can do this
we just have to be brave
but not too brave or else matt damon will come and take all our money
alright dude can we lay off the matt damon jokes please theyre just getting old
tom warm up the wienerschnitzel and put on your lederhosen because now people are being told to stop making matt damon jokes opponents are claiming that the jokes are already tired and matt damon had every right to make a bitcoin commercial so the jokes need to stop all we can say is– verzeihung für die witze cause its gettin real nazi germany up in here back to you tom
im sorry sir but we arent seating anyone who isnt wearing their pajamas
please maam i just want to sit down and eat
i understand but the management prefers that everyone inside be nice and comfy womfy
so i have to be comfy womfy to get a rooty tooty fresh n fruity
sir im just the hostess here if you prefer you only need to wear your pajamas to get in you dont have to wear them at your table while youre actively eating
so its okay if we put on our pajamas walk through the whole restaurant to the table and then take our pajamas off what is the fucking point
what seems to be the problem here
oh i see bringst du mich ins gefängnis bringst du mich der führer
remember no matter how angry he is tell him hes right

testaburger thats it
attention all students this is your principal i need to inform you that a mistake has been made mr mackey your counselor totally screwed up the calendar today is not pajama day it is in fact opposite day so we will be having breakfast for lunch in the cafeteria and anything else youve been told to do you can now do the opposite
fuck yes its opposite day
hey frank it looks like its over the school says the kids can wear what they want because its opposite day
its opposite day well shit we gotta go put some normal clothes on
aw how come
because we are people who believe very strongly in wearing pajamas to the workplace if were wearing pajamas on opposite day that means we dont normally wear pajamas and were douchebags like mike
alright you can all go home its opposite day
oh then should i be wearing pajamas
i dont know what to wear now
you cant make me wear pajamas
thats fine you can all wear whatever you want as long as it covers your dick and tits
