were gonna get served on saturday arent we
what i dont wanna get served
yeah you didnt tell us that we might get served
well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like-
all right all right quiet children now nobodys getting served if i can help it we just gotta buckle down dig deep and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer
what do you want
i came to ask you one more time to join the crew everyone is practicing really hard but i dont think we have any kind of shot without you
sorry stan im not a dancer anymore i gave that up
your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country
did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed
yeah she said your shoe came off it wasnt your fault
yeah well you tell that to their families
look butters accidents happen we all have to live with that
i let those people down dont you get it man eight people died
well it was nine actually one of the women was pregnant
what
and eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward
aaaah
but that isnt the point butters the point is that this is now its on and there are people who need you to step up look nobody likes having to rise to a challenge but competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "haha im better than you" is part of life and if you cant face that then you might as well sit here and play legos until youre an old man
get out of my room stan
fine but someday youre gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it otherwise you might as well move to france with all the other pussies
yeah make some noise
