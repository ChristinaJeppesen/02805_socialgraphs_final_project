so you made sweet love to her down by the fire
no no we just sat there all night long and taaalked
talked

raisin oatmeal
raisin oatmeal and i said "well take a graham crunch how much will that be" and she looks at me and she says "uh i need about tree-fitty"

well it was about that time that i notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era
the loch ness monster
i said "dammit monster get off my lawn i aint giving you no tree-fitty" it said "how about just two-fitty" i said "oh now its only two-fitty what is there a sale on loch ness munchies or something"
