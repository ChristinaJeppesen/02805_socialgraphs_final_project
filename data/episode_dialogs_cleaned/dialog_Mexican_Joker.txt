some people like their weed made the old-fashioned way here at tegridy we believe weed is about people over the past few months tegridy has expanded from the simple farmhouse you see behind me to actually owning the entire 420 valley and i think youll see on this tour that even though our business has grown we just kept our weed simple it takes over a thousand plants to make just one box of tegridy weed theres juan carlos over there hes one of our newest employees mornin juan carlos what happens when you combine science with tegridy a lot of magic here you can see our latest growing methods along with our science center and of course it wouldnt be colorado weed without our rocky mountain high tasting room feel free to come back here later and try all our tegridy products well folks we hope you enjoyed your tour theres a lot to buy here in the gift shop and please do remember your tour guides work on tips lets give me a big hand

what happened to our country people are being wronged by a broken system and we must say "no more" no more homegrown marijuana
yeah thats right yeah thats right me too yeah thats right
as the son of a proud american farmer i am concerned about what homegrown can lead to people can grow weed wrong and poison themselves what
yeah thats right yeah come on
unscrupulous growers could use cheap irrigation and drown babies oh come on
thats right drown babies yeah drown babies thats right drown babies
the fact is simple marijuana must be grown with tegridy
tegridy
tegridy
stupid government how can they sit there and look a child in the face and its fine for people to grow their own weed
oh why does it matter
why does it ugh am i the only person here who understands what this will do to us
yeah but dad youre gonna piss off everybody in south park

ohh i told you rich big-city folk before you cant buy tegridy
you seem to be fighting the same fight we are we just wanna help you ever heard of med men
yeah i think so what do you want with me
well we have a common problem homegrown weed
were just worried about safety you know babies drowning in irrigation and such
yeah i hate watching babies drown seems like a waste of a good baby
were glad you agree now what-
so you guys wanna team up and piggyback on the goodwill of the legalization movement for some good old-fashioned crony capitalism im totally in
sorry for our little mistake were goin to get you on your way home as soon as we can
what about all the other kids when do they get to go home
hey when its raining you gotta roll up the windows we understand these things are hard for your people
my people arent you worried about what youre creating here
what do you mean
youre pulling children away from their parents and isolating them behind bars
yes
youre traumatizing them and teaching them to fear the us government
correct
okay let me try to put this in terms you people will understand you know superhero movies right
yeah
okay you remember how they always create the villain some random person who when they were a child got taken from their parents and locked away and the kid was just left to sit and plot revenge what youre doing here is creating a mexican joker and whats a mexican joker gonna do hes gonna grow up and have memories of being wronged by you and he will grow and wait and then finally fight back with a passion unlike anything youve ever seen
which one of them do you think is mexican joker
no it could be any of them thats the point you dont know which kid in there is gonna snap from being separated and locked down like this
but doesnt mexican joker understand that were just doing our job and making america great
mexican joker doesnt care when that kid grows up all that will matter is getting back at all of you
well what would mexican joker-
hey david can i talk to you alone please excuse us kid now then the most important thing is that weve got to keep this quiet we cant let mexican joker know that were onto him
i dont wanna be part of a bad guy flashback scene maybe we should get kids out of here
now listen thats just what he wants us to do
what are you saying
im saying what if hes on mexican jokers side
hey randy did you go make a deal with another weed company
yes towelie im working on a merger with med men
med men but those guys are posers
we have a deal in the works to help each other put a stop to home-growers once and for all
jesus you know i knew a guy who thought weed should be for everybody a guy who believed in integrity i dont understand who you even are anymore
thats because im the president of the company and you are a towel
youre a towel
what is wrong with trying to protect our business
because weed isnt supposed to be some money-grubbin business model its a gift from god and not something to exploited by some stupid towel
i am not a towel
yeah yeah sure thing randy you are not a towel

oh hey jeff rodgers read an article about how electroshock therapy can help people whove gone through traumatic experiences we figured some treatments could help mexican joker deal with his trauma
are you guys completely stupid we cant perform shock therapy on every child that comes in here think of the budgetary restraints
to hell with the costs jeff if mexican joker doesnt have flashbacks then he doesnt grow up to be a monster
what if this is the flashback we might be in the flashback dave maybe youre shocking the child that grows up to be mexican joker
oh god i dont know which way is up anymore
we cant fight this guy alone dave its time to alert the military
dont it feel like the wind is always howlin dont it seem like theres never any light santa never comes for me santa claus no está aquí aw come on kyle i know its no fun to be in here but you cant think about yourself think about the greater good now when you dont like people you can have then taken from their families and put into camps why does that make you ohhh my god ohhh jesus kyle ive totally forgotten youre a of course youre extra sensitive to this stuff oh dude im so sorry oh my god kyle i didnt even make the connection you know i was just like oh im gonna have kyle thrown into a detention camp thatll be sweet" and i didnt stop to think that for you guys its not that sweet man if i had just thought it through for like two more minutes i would have got you back some other way i feel terrible kyle
