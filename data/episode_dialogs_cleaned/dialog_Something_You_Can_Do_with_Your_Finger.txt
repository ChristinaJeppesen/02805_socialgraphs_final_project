and what if they do make it sharon what if they do make it are you gonna be the one to tell im
mom whats up dads ass
its a long story shelly lets just say your father has a lot up his ass right now
oh oh-h hello eric
problem chef i have m-many problems
wellll if you uhhh come back in just a little bit eric ill see if i can help you out
i just dont know what im gonna do sometimes i wonder if god isnt toying with me
alright eric whats the matter
chef god told me i was to start a boy band and make $10 million the problem is it isnt working i mean i feel the music burning inside me but i just cant express it right you know
well eric i i think you were just focusin in on the wrong thing boy bands arent about music boy bands are created by corporations to make money theyre all based on the gomlich effect
whats the gomlich effect
the law of physics that states "if one girl screams for something it will make other girls scream and then it grows exponentiously until all girls within a five-mile radius are screaming"
so how do boy bands use that
all they do is make videos showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band once you get girls screaming you cant stop em theyre crazy uh-uh except for lillith of course
thanks
youre welcome now go away
okay
a-and a cucumber in the pants never hurt either
cucumber in the pants got it
alright everybody listen up this is how this first shot is gonna work the girls are standing here and then the members of the band walk by looking cool when you see us you girls all scream like "oh my god its fingerbang oh my god" okay

because i said so
dad cartman said were gonna perform at the mall at 3 oclock my friends are gonna be pissed off at me
let em be pissed off then
i dont understand just let me go do this one thing and i wont ever--
no nooo
dad what the hell is going on
i was i was 18 when my high-school mens choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in denver i was just one of fifteen members and i had no idea that a record producer was in the audience
producer
randy
producer
randy
producer
randy
producer
randy
producer
randy
producer
and just like that i left everything i dropped out of high school
randy
i said good-bye to my girlfriend
randy
and i left my family
randy
and suddenly there i was thrown into a group with four other young men who i didnt even know
producer
ghetto avenue boys
randy
the songs were terrible but believe it or not the country ate them up the next thing i knew we were the biggest thing in the world
ghetto avenue boys
randy
i had everything a huge house and all the women you can imagine and then one day just as quick as it started
mr allens
randy
mr allens
randy
mr allens
randy
mr allens
randy
mr allens
they said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio so they towed my car
tow truck driver
the women all left
women
and they took back my house
randy
mr allens
the only thing i could do was come back to colorado and face everyone that i had abandoned
woman
man
and so you see stanley i do know what im talking about
jesus christ i never knew
i didnt want you to know because now im a joke ever since then ive wished every single day that i could go back to that moment when i was offered the job and say "no" because all the fame and the money the women all it did was build me up so that i could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world that is what being in a boy band is all about stanley its people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last nights pork chops now we wander the earth in disarray—us new kids on the block the osmonds were all the same and that is why you cant go to the mall
oh-kay
wow there must be at least 20 people out there
where the hell is stan
hell be here stan wouldnt douche
i swear to god if he ruins this dream of mine i will have his nuts
hey uh are you gonna do that thing or what
yes yes sir any second—were just waiting on one more member
well hurry up i cant keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer
yeah well start right away well have to do it without him

come here stanley stan it was wrong of me to try and stop you from joining a boy band without explaining why ive made some mistakes in my life and now i have to let you make your own mistakes
yeah
you know in a way i think i was even jealous of you being in a boy band isnt that stupid
not really not any more stupid than some of the other stuff youve done
well come on ill drive you down to the mall
really
yeah i wanna see what you guys can do and then well go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this
alright
whats happening here
i dont know uh i guess nothing
