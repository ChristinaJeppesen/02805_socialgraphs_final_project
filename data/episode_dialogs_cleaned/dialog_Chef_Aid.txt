how dare you come on mr twig
hello there children
hey chef
you got stinky britchesstinky--
what did you say
he singing some new hit song
eric where did you hear that song
it’s all over the place on the radio mtv everywhere
well ill be sodomized on christmas
what dude
children i wrote that song 20 years ago
you wrote it
yeah back when i used to be in the rock business and now it looks like some big record company has published one of my songs
wow then you should get money for it
aww i dont want any money i just like to see my name on the credits thats all
then we should go to the record company my dads a lawyer dude he tells me about this stuff all the time
well all right maybe i will go i’ll play them my version of the song
stinky britchesyou got those stinky britches
so you see mr big record producer "stinky britches" was something i wrote several years ago
hmm… i really so no resemblance between that song and "stinky britches" by our artist alanis morissette
huh
it’s the same goddamn song
now look i’m trying to be cool about this but you just cant rip peoples music off its against the law
i am above the law
mr chef i’m afraid you leave me no alternative we’re going to sue you
sue me you stole one of my songs and you’re gonna sue me
yes i suggest you get a real good lawyer we’ll have the best in the business
we’ll get my dad to be chef’s lawyer
yeah and he’s jewish
stinkystinky britchesstinky britches
mr twig is that you
mis-mr twig
aagghh mr twig no
who did this to you mr twig who
now just let me do all the talking chef we’re gonna bring these bastards down
right
this court is now in session whos representing the defense
i am your honor gerald broflovski
and representing the prosecution
i am your honor
uh-oh
why "uh-oh"
chef thats johnnie cochran hes the guy who knocked oj off
uh-oh
i need some help over here please help i think hes got third-degree burns
give the child to me
is he going to be all right doctor
uhhh
is he going to live
its a stick
dammit dont give me that medical jargon just tell me straight is he going to be okay
and so on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of theday johnnie cochran has appeared to defend capitalist records the question now is will cochran use his famous "chewbacca defense"
whats a "chewbacca defense"
i dont know
thats what cochran used in the oj simpson trial
goddamn i hate that cochran guy if he was in front of me id be like "hey you stupid son of a bitch you-- how howd you like me to kick you in the nuts"
im sure that would scare the hell out of him cartman
and so in summation ladies and gentlemen of the jury youve heard the version of my clients song recorded over twenty years ago youve heard the exact same song produced by those cheats in the past month id say its pretty much an open-and-shut case make the right decision thank you
weve got em
mr johnnie cochran your closing arguments
ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury chefs attorney would certainly want you to believe that his client wrote "stinky britches" ten years ago and they make a good case hell i almost felt pity myself but ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury i have one final thing i want you to consider
ladies and gentleman this is chewbacca chewbacca is a wookie from the planet kashyyyk but chewbacca lives on the planet endor now think about that that does not make sense
dammit
what
he’s using the chewbacca defense
why would a wookiee an 8-foot-tall wookiee want to live on endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall ewoks that does not make sense but more important you have to ask yourself "what does this have to do with this case" nothing
ladies and gentlemen it has nothing to do with this case it does not make sense look at me im a lawyer defending a major record company and im talkin about chewbacca does that make sense ladies and gentlemen i am not making any sense none of this makes sense and so you have to remember when youre in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the emancipation proclamation does it make sense no ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury it does not make sense if chewbacca lives on endor you must acquit the defense rests
o-kay then
wow he’s good
in a teary-eyed courtroom johnnie cochran has just finished his closing arguments and as anticipated he did use the chewbacca defense
whether or it worked is up to the jury to decide
how find you the jury
we find the defendant jerome "chef" mcelroy guilty as charged
whoops
whoops
mr chef you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label the full fee of two million dollars will be handed over within 24 hours
do i look like i have two million
well you have 24 hours to find it or else you have to go to jail for eight million years
uh its actually for four years

what the hell is this
welcome to chef aid chef
wow howd you get out of jail chef
mr hat busted me out children did you do this
well we helped
we’re gonna raise your money chef
i don’t believe it
we’ll just see how long this chef aid thing lasts
and now here he is tvs ozzy osbourne
were all here to help our good friend chef who has touched our lives in the past
i remember when i was just starting out chef suggested i buy a pompadour hat i thought he said "bite the head off a bat" so i did and the rest oh its just history now lets go crazyyy
aint nowhere to run
aint nowhere to hide
aarrggghhh
(all right dude let me go now)
oh my god ozzy osbourne bit kenny’s head off
you bastard
and now here’s ween
were thrilled to be part of chef aid
chef was the guy who told us to do a country album
no dude that was steves idea
oh then whos chef
i dont know dude i thought you knew him
oh well anyways heres our song
many colors in the homo rainbowdont be afraid to let your colors shine shiiiiiiiiiiine
dont worry mr twig even though mr hat rescued me from prison im still going to stick with you
did you love him
it doesnt matter he left me
did you love him
yes
then run to him
but i feel like im making the wrong decision
love isnt a decision it’s a feeling if we could decide who we love it would be much simpler but much less magical
ill never forget you mr twig thank you
and now ladies and gentlemen mr elton john whoo
thank you all for coming to help chef this is a song written by a very special little boy i have no idea what his name is but who the hell cares anyway he wrote it for his girlfriend
wake up wendy
smell the coffee
hey thats your song for wendy
ha-ha youre a wuss
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha i win you lose chef aid is over and you didnt raise near enough money to pay cochrans legal fees ha-ha-ha-ha i win
and what happened then well in south park they say
johnnie cochrans heart grew three sizes that day
wait mr chef this music has really touched me i like to take up your case free of charge
you will
i will
no
well see you in court mr record producer
noooooooo
ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury you must now decide whether or not to reverse the decision for my client chef i know he seems guilty but ladies and gentlemen this
is chewbacca now think about that for one minute that does not make sense why am i talkin about chewbacca when a mans life is on the line why i tell you why i dont know it doesnt make sense if chewbacca does not make sense you must acquit
here look at the monkey look at the silly monkey
chef how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song "stinky britches"
it feels great i just cant find the words to thank all the artists who put on chef aid and most of all i want to thank the children
so what are you gonna do now
get back to whats important its tuesday and means tomorrow is tuna casserole day
hooray
