way up in the mountains in a small little townthe main street was being decorated all up and downpeople stood in long lines sometimes waiting hours or morebecause christmas needs to be bought in a storebut out in the forest not too far away
the little woodland critters were also preparing for their christmas day
its almost time when the time is herethe time thats only once a yearwe can hardly wait cause its so neara woodland critter christmas
the little critters worked hard as they happily sangand each one of them had a quite interesting namethere was squirrely the squirrel rabbity the rabbitbeavery the beaver and beary the bearporcupiney the porcupine skunky the skunkfoxy the fox and deery the deerwoodpeckery the woodpecker mousey the mouseand chickadee-y the chickadee all made the forest their houseand on that magical day stumbling upon all of thatwas a surprised little boy in a red poofball hat
what the hell
christmastime is once a yearevery critter holds it dearevery animal big or smallchristmas means so much to us all
well hello there welcome to our forest
how do you like our christmas tree
its nice
why its the most perfect tree in the forest
oh no i see a problem
what is it mousey
our christmas tree doesnt have a star
awww
we cant have a tree with no star on it
what are we gonna do
now dont be down yall maybe our new friend can help us find a star
can you really oh would you please could you help us
okay okay
yay
and so using some paper and working with gleethe boy in the red poofball hat made a star for the tree
ohhhh
its the nicest star i ever saw
the little critters cheered and beavery said with a smile
how would you like to sing and dance with us for a while
the boy in the red poofball hat smiled and said
uh no thanks im gonna go home
goo- goodbye stanny
goodbye stanny bye cya ill buy your hat
woof
hi stanny
oh whatta
his friends were all there what a wonderful surprisethe little boy smiled with joy in his eyes
what time is it
you arent gonna believe what happened stanny its the most magical christmas gift ever
porcupiney is pregnant
you guys i have to go to school tomorrow
i deduce the man-boy doesnt understand the seriousness of the fertilization
porcupiney is a virgin stanny her conception was immaculate
shes gonna give birth to our lord and savior
what
it has been foretold unto me that i would give birth on christmas day
so soon
how delightful
our souls are saved
finally the critters are gonna have a savior of their very own of their very own
theres just one problem we dont have a manger for our savior to be born in
awwww
but we got to have a manger
can you do it stan can you build us a manger huh
(cheers)
"of course ill build you a little manger" the little boy criedand he winked at his critter friends and leapt to their side
and out in the woods the boy steamed right aheadmaking a place for the critter babe to lay its sweet head
gee whiz if it isnt the nicest manger i ever saw
i deduce it shall serve as a perfectly suitable resting place for the son of our lord
does this mean we can go to sleep now
my son will have the nicest bed in all the forest
fit for a king
this is going to be the best critter christmas ever
its almost time when the time is herethe time thats only once a yearwe can hardly wait cause its so near --
all right im going now
the mountain lion hide
go away shoo
is it gone
i deduce it is
im not c-c-comin out
well this is the end the mountain lion obviously knows porcupiney is pregnant and hes gonna kill it again
again
every christmas the mountain lion comes down and eats the virgin critter impregnated with the son of our lord
oh dear im so very afraid
lets face it the mountain lion will never let our savior be born
awwww
hey we shouldnt be upset this christmas weve got stanny
of course stanny can do anything if he can build a manger he can stop that mean ol mountain lion
christmas is saved
high up in the forest on a dark craggy peakthe horrid mountain lion and preyed on the weakfor the critters to be saved someone had to stop that nasty old cat
goddammit this is fucking ridiculous
said the little boy in the red poofball hat
killing a mountain lion was no easy taskbut he thought of a plan and he thought of it fast
grrr grrr come on out come on critter killer your days of slaughtering innocent little animals are over rawrrrrr rawrrrrr
in a flash it was over a victorious blowthe mountain lion lay slain on the cold ground below
okay there
mommy mommy w wake up mommy wake up
dont leave us mommy man-boy why why did you kill our mommy why
i the critters their bir-birth of a savior
the tiny cubs all gathered together and criedall alone in the world because their mother had died
aw- awww
oooo
you all right lady porcupiney
oh yes just felt a little kick is all
well its been much too long now uh im afraid our helpful friend stanny must be very dead
yep the mountain lion probably swallowed him whole
i guess that means our savior is gonna be made into savior stew
awwww
wait a minute look
stanny
stanny youre alive
but does that mean you killed the mountain lion
its dead
for real and for true
are you sure
im sure it wont be hurting you anymore
he did it now our critter christmas can finally happen hail satan
hail satan
wait wha-what
youve done us a huge favor stanny without the mountain lion around the lady porcupiney can give birth to the antichrist
yaaay
wai-wait the antichrist you said she was giving birth to your savior
yeah to the son of our lord satan prince of darkness
but i thought you meant the son of god
well think about it you really think god would have sex with a porcupine
no way only satan prince of darkness and king of all evil would do that yay
this just calls for a celebration lets sacrifice rabbity and eat his flesh
yay sacrifice me to the devil
drink his blood drink his blood
blood orgy
yay blood orgy blood orgy yay
what special time and special dayits woodland critter christmas
hail satan
in the gentle forest clearing on christmas eve mornthe little forest critters prepared for the antichrist to be bornthe noble mountain lion had stopped evil in all the years pastbut now the good protector lay dead as the good owls amassedand meanwhile three lion cubs were crying awayfor them there would certainly be no christmas dayand soon the forest would suffer from the offspring satan begatall of this because of the little boy in the red poofball hat
ugh
now that hed killed the noble lion queenthere was nobody to stop the apocalypse it seemed
uuugh
"i know" he said with a new happy grin"ill go back to the forest and speak with those critters again"
no no-no-no
he ran out the living room turned out the lightand went back to the forest to set everything rightand went back to the forest to set everything righthe tried to forget all about it by watching tvbut his conscience caught up with him and to the forest he did fleehe thought he could hide from his problems - not truehe knew in his heart the thing he had to do
leave me alone
he knew that only by going to the forest could he --
all right all right all right god
hey look everyone its our old pal stanny
oh boy stanny you came just in time
yeah weve got a big problem
the great satan has commanded that when the antichrist is born we must find a human host body to transfer it into
that way he could take over the whole world the whole world
the human must be non-baptized and heathenistic against christ
we figured youd be perfect
yay
im not a heathen i was baptized and my familys christian
awwwww
but we got to have a human host body for the antichrist
oh dear maybe we wont have a critter c-christmas after all
now dont be down yall stanny can help us find non-baptized heathen human
will you really stanny
no im not doing you anymore favors and im not letting you give birth to the antichrist i came here to put a stop to all this
to stop us
but gee whiz stan if you try to stop us wed have to use our evil satanic powers on ya
right whatever im taking down the manger i built ah aaaah aagh aaaahh aaaaaaah aaaaaaah
oh boy our satanic powers sure did the trick
our powers get stronger every day get stronger every day
sorry stanny but you see nothing can stop the birth of the antichrist except for a mountain lion
and you got rid of her
yay
the boy shook with anger he broke a sweat and fell illthen he remembered there were three mountain cubs still alive on the hill
oh yeah
hello anybody in there
oh no its the man-boy who killed mommy
hes come to kill us now
its okay i died inside when mommy was killed anyways
yeah better this than the slow death wed face without a mother around
look im sorry i killed your mom the the squirrel told me she was evil
you got tricked by a squirrel gee youre not too smart are you mister
im trying to make this all right again but the only thing that can stop devil-worshiping critters is a mountain lion
yeah and you killed her
well youre mountain lions
us no were just kids we still have our baby teeth
and our baby claws
and a dead mom
there still has to be a way for you to kill the porcupines baby
what you mean like in an abortion
yeah an abortion that can work
but we dont know how to give abortions
do you know some place we can learn mister
"where can they learn that" the boy said with a frown"i know the abortion clinic just outside of town"
what
so he picked up the cubs and down the mountain he stormedand took them to where abortions are performed
no he didnt
yes he did
no he didnt
yes he did
no he didnt
yes he did
oh goddammit
said the boy in the red poofball hat "weve made it already little cubs fancy that"
excuse me what are you doing here
the abortion doctor inquired
if you wanna be in the or a pass is required
i dont know i- im supposed to show these mountain lions how an abortion is performed or something i i know its ridiculous
well youre in luck im happy to informits only three days until christmas so i have lots of abortions to performgather around my table cute little lionsill teach you to do abortions without even tryin
and so the little boy and the cubs gathered around the chair baseand all day watched abortion after abortion take place

the little boy fretted he almost started to bawlbut thats when he came up with the best idea of all
the lion cubs
the little boy quickly begun
i took them to see how abortions are done

and in the twinkling starlight each little cub did their portionthey remembered all they had learned and gave kyle an abortion
