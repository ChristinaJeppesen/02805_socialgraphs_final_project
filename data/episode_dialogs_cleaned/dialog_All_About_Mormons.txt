randy the last thing we want is for people to think were pushing our religion we know there are a lot of beliefs out there and ours just works for us
to each his own right
yeah yeah you know to be honest ive never known any mormons i dont
well because they found ancient books they had written on gold plates right where the angel moroni said they would be
i found them i found them youre not gonna believe it everybody i found them
found what
another new testament of jesus christ
what what did he say are you crazy
last night a native america angel told me where i could find another testament of jesus christ so i went out to the woods i dug around all morning where the angel had told me to look
maybe there isnt anything out here wait a tick whats this wow
inside the stone box i found the magical seer stones under that i found four gold plates written in strange writing
this must be the gospel that jesus told the nephites
well they were the most amazing things id ever gazed upon
well so where are they
where are what
the gold plates and the seer stones where are they
oh well i was not allowed to take them you see after i found the plates the angel moroni appeared to me again and said that i am not allowed to show the plates or the seer stones to anybody because first i must translate whats written on the plates into english so you can all read it
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
wow amazing
he found the stones and golden platesdumb dumb dumb dumb dumbeven though nobody else ever saw themdumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
so howd it go clubber lange you kicked mr harrisons ass
not exactly were uh having their family over for dinner tomorrow night

sharon did you know this guy joseph smith found a new testament to the bible buried here in america
what are you talking about
well its just that the harrisons are really nice people and you should see how loving and together their family is i i think theres something to that religion

yeah i had a question about that joseph smith guy
sure
what happened after he found the golden plates buried in the ground
well he kept them hidden from everyone like he was told and then he translated what was written on the plates into the book of mormon
yeah but how
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
whats this all about mr smith
mr harris can you keep a secret
well sure i can
i have in my possession an ancient book written on gold plates that tells of jesus christs second coming here in america
in america really that sounds kind of
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
its true and im going to translate the plates and publish it into a book for the whole world to read now ahah-i know you have a lot of money mr harris and im just gonna need a little bit to pay for the publishing costs
mmm i dont know uh how do you expect to translate it
with these
rocks
theyre not rocks theyre seer stones given to me by an angel with them god allowed me to translate the plates into english watch you take this quill and paper and write down what i say sit here i have the golden plates here in this hat i need to have them somewhere dark so i can read the spiritual light
really
now when i put the seer stones into the hat the ancient letter light up and change into english which i can then read to you
wow
ooo im seeing the light oh okay write this down "and so it was that christ appeared before the nephites"
and thats how the book of mormon was writtendumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dadumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdahumb dahumb dumb dumb dumb dumbdumb dumb dumb dumb duuumb duuumb
one two three four "pay one thousand dollars property tax" isnt this great you guys our first family home evening
i wanna watch tv
were not watching tv were mormons now and were having family home evening
dad did you know that that joseph smith guy read the book of mormon out of a hat
and your turn sharon
its just that the book of mormon says a lot of strange stuff like that adam and eve lived in jackson county missouri
yes
but school taught me that the first man and woman lived in africa
well you cant believe everything school tells you stan your turn shelly oooo that must be the harrisons
hey everybody
wow what a great house
you must be mrs marsh its so nice to meet you
and you must be stans sister oh i think your brothers the greatest
my brother is a stupid turd
hey stan
hey gary
well come on in and sit down everybody youre here just in time my son was having a little problem with our new religion
dad
ohohoho really well thats just because he hasnt heard the best part about the joseph smith story the one that proves he was for real
yeah woohoo
ooo whats that
well you remember martin harris the rich man who wrote down what joseph smith read out of the hat
yeah
see after he was done he took some of the pages of what would become the book of mormon home
martin went home to his wifedumb dumb dumb dumb dumband showed her pages from the book of mormondumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
a-and so joseph smith put his head into a hat a-and read to me what the golden plates said i wrote it all down and were gonna publish it into a book
martin how do you know he isnt just making stuff up and pretending hes translating off golden plates
lucy harris smart smart smartsmart smart smart smart smart
why would he make it up
martin harris dumb dadumb-
all right here im gonna hide these pages if joseph smith really is translating off of golden plates then hell be able to do it again but if joseph smith is making it all up then the new translations will be different from these
okay fine i bet hell have no problem
lucy harris smart smart smartmartin harris dumbso martin went on back to smithsaid the pages had gone awaysmith got mad and told martinhe needed to go praydumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
look ah im sorry about losin the pages we worked on joe but im ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates
i would love to martin except i just had a vision and the lord said hes very angry with me for letting you take those pages
he is
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
yes he is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of lehi again hes we must now translate from the plate of nephi so it will be the same basic story but written a little differently
wow if god got angry with you then you must be tellin the truth
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb
all right martin lets get to work
and thats how it happened
yeah all right
wait mormons actually know this story and they still believe joseph smith was a prophet
well sure the story proves it doesnt it
no it proves he did make it all up are you blind
well stan its all a matter of faith
no its a matter of logic if youre gonna say things that have been proven wrong like that the first man and woman lived in missouri and that native americans came from jerusalem then youd better have something to back it up all youve got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat and then couldnt do it again when the translations were hidden
hey stan dont denounce our religion
i dont wanna be mormon dad
me neither
hey thats only cool guys you can believe whatever you want
yeah its great you have your own beliefs
yeah hooray for the marshes
oh stop it thats another thing why do you have to be so freakin nice all the time it isnt normal you just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my dad
yeah
well kids whos up for a water balloon fight
yeah all right
oh hey stan wheres your best buddy gary
im not hanging around that kid anymore
oh no you guys broke up
you guys were right okay the new kids a douche now i just gotta find a way to keep him away from me
hey stan
oh brother
uh oh the jilted lover returns
listen i just wanted to let you know you dont have to worry about me tryin to be your friend anymore
i dont
look maybe us mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense and maybe joseph smith did make it all up but i have a great life and a great family and i have the book of mormon to thank for that the truth is i dont care if joseph smith made it all up because what the church teaches now is loving your family being nice and helping people and even though people in this town might think thats stupid i still choose to believe in it all i ever did was try to be your friend stan but youre so high and mighty you couldnt look past my religion and just be my friend back youve got a lot of growing up to do buddy suck my balls
damn that kid is cool huh
