teeheeheehee
i see the questions in your eyesi know whats weighing on your mindyou can be sure i know my heartgirl ill stand beside you through the yearsyoull only cry those happy tearsand though i make mistakes ill never break your hearti swear by the moon and the stars in the skyill be therei swear (i swear) like a shadow thats by your side (keep it down girl)ill be therefor better or worse (better or worse) till death do us part (death do us part)ill love you with every black beat of my heartand i swear i swear i s-we-e-e-ear yeah i swear straight up what it do
did you see that tolkien was gonna push her but then he tickled her instead
dude why are you so into their relationship
i dont know its just so perfect
you motherfucker
kyle jesus christ
what the hell are you doing telling people that were a gay couple
oh heard that through the grapevine did you
the new girl liked me and so you lied to her
somebody had to intervene kyle you were standing in the way of tolkien and nichole they belong together
just because two people are the same race doesnt mean they belong together you fat racist piece of fucking garbage
oh oh im a racist huh im a racist its how nature works kyle look look what about luke covina and maria sanchez is it a coincidence they ended up together
actually i heard theyre together because they got locked in the school gym overnight a few months ago
oh did they i hadnt heard about that
teehee that was us remember eric
shh quiet cupid me
what
nothing
who is cupid me
nobody
you are gonna tell everyone that you lied and that we arent a couple
why kyle so you can try and ruin things for tolkien and nichole look at how happy they are is it that you want to ruin that or are you just homophobic
goddamnit
nichole your mother tells me that you already have a boyfriend at school
his name is tolkien hes really nice
well thats good but your mother tells me that this boy is black
so
well nichole its just you know just because youre black doesnt mean you can only date black boys its just a little weird that we moved to this whole new place and youre immediately drawn to the one other black person
oh stop william theres nothing wrong with her dating a black person
im not saying its wrong im just saying shes gonna have to deal with racist people out there people turning their heads and saying "oh look at the two black people together that figures"
its not like that dad we just happen to like each other i know it seems like a strange coincidence but it really is a coincidence
and we are very happy for you sweetheart here have some more turkey
yeah just try the white meat i know its a little dry but theres a lot more of it
come on other people have to use the bathroom you know can you hurry it up in there
