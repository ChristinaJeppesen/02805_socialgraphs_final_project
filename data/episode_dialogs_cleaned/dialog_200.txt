no buts you wanna to accuse somebody of being a fudgepacker youre gonna pay the consequences
guys i want to really thank you all for coming shockingly ive just been slandered once again in the town of south park something i know you can all relate to
that town just seems to be a hotbed of hatred and lies
im fed up with it that town suggested that i was made of shit
yeah well i was just over there doing some fly fishing and this little boy walks up and calls me a fudge packer i know right and then other kids in the town and their teacher start joining in
south park colorado is the most racist insensitive and bigoted place in this country
that town thinks they can say whatever they want about people and get away with it
if anyone has a gripe against that shithole its me
yeah well i say enough all of us together can put a stop to that slander coming from that town once and for all no longer will they make snide remarks about whoever they want
yeah
hey tom i ate too much subway wheres your bathroom
oh just the door down the hall there jared no no no thats a closet go down more no thats a closet too nope jared thats a closet too no thats a closet no that- thats a closet too
stan marsh to the principals office stan marsh come to the principals office immediately
dude what did you do
i have no idea
you just had to push it didnt you stan you just had to make fun of tom cruise again
did you call him a fudge packer
aww he was packing fudge
little boy you dont understand how serious this is tom cruise has put together a class-action lawsuit along with 200 other celebrities
they are going to sue the bejezzus out of this entire town mkay
it wasnt just me other kids called him a fudge packer even mr gar-
but you started it mr broflovski tell him what you told us
stan a class-action lawsuit means the end of this town we cant possibly go up against their lawyers
dammit marsh why couldnt you have just kept your stupid ugly kid in line
hey dont start blaming me for his looks
mr cruise my son is so so sorry and he would do anything to take back his hurtful comments
thats nice im still suing you all nobody calls me a fudge packer
yes it was a terrible mistake but maybe you could see how since you do take fudge and pack it into a box
what
we- i-im just saying that you are employed currently as a person who packages
i am an actor i do not pack fudge
right my son just got confused because you have a little uniform and a hat that says "freds fudge and candies" and you are look it doesnt matter just please withdraw the class-action lawsuit nobody in our town will ever call you a fudge packer again
well there is one thing that your town could do to maybe make me forget about this lawsuit
anything anything you want mr cruise
its just that theres somebody that i have always wanted to meet face to face if you could get him to show up in your town-
sure who is it we can get anybody for you
muhammad the prophet of the muslim faith
ooooooo
thats tricky
well then you can just get sued
mr cruise if there is anybody else we could bring to town we-
no just him you get muhammad to appear in south park or your little town is done
okay people i know i know but he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just get muhammad to appear in south park
are you nuts if muhammad appears in south park we get bombed
we dont know that maybe enough time has passed and now its now okay to show muhammad
dude i cant believe we are dealing with this muhammad thing again
but even if it were safe for muhammad come how would we ever find him
yeah showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored so nobody has seen what muhammad looks like
i saw him once
you did
yeah a while ago my friends joined david blaines cult and i had to go to the super best friends to rescue them muhammad was one of the super best friends
oh and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed
no dude it was totally fine
muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all
well a giant john wilkes booth shot abraham lincoln
alright stan thats enough jesus cant learn to shut up can you now look i believe we can find muhammad ive done a lot of research and i have completed a sketch of what muhammad might look like today
no dont is that okay to show
i dont know i guess well see
tom what is up with this muhammad thing it doesnt make sense
yeah you said we were just suing south park
no i said we were going to use south park to make sure we never got ripped on again look people all of us get ridiculed but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander
you want muhammad because he cant be ridiculed
muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of what if we could harness that power jimmy buffet how would you like it if nobody could call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage
i id love it
by taking what muhammad has we could all be safe from ridicule like tim burton here imagine it tim nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies youve made lately thered never be a tv show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since beetlejuice and you put johnny depp and the same crappy music in every film and if youre that in love with johnny depp you should just have sex with him already a tv show could never say that
gee thatd be swell
well it can be a reality once we have muhammad we can take his power from him
excuse me this is the home of tom cruise right
hey its one of the boys from south park who slandered me
i didnt come for myself im just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit
who
alllloooo
jennifer lopez
yes i am hennifer lopez and i like tacos and burritos
in the great hall of the super best friends there are assembled the leaders of the worlds biggest religions jesus buddha krishna muhammad lao tzu and joseph smith and the mighty semen
its not semen its seaman
their mission to right back which is wrong and to serve all mankind
jesus all we are asking you to do is bring muhammad to our town for like an hour
my son much has changed since you were last here muhammad cannot make public appearances
we simply cannot risk any violence from the muslim people
awww not you guys too jesus fucking christ
later at the hall of the super best friends
okay will you let muhammad come to south park if we dress him like a pirate
no muslims would still be angry if you showed his face
k what if we cover his face with a paper bag
no cause you would still be showing him walking around that could be a-trouble
okay a suit of armor we just have muhammad in a suit of armor so you cant see anything
but its still muhammad walking around in human form
aww come on this is ridiculous
boys you need to understand that people get very offended when muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure
buddha dont do coke in front of kids
a u-haul what if we bring muhammad to south park in the back of a u-haul and he just stays in there out of sight
but hes talking from the u-haul
well yeah hes got to talk or nobody knows hes in there
hearing his voice i dont know what do you think moses
um would there be windows on the u-haul
there doesnt have to be
um i guess i guess that would be okay
here it is friends once we have muhammad this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of
tom tom youre talkin crazy mate only muhammad has that ability how could we ever get it from him
we take his goo its as simple as that people
rob reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth
any goo can be harvested from a persons body and easily placed into another
wait you mean we arent going to sue and get a bunch of money
no jen weve all got enough money
yes who needs more money we need to get muhammads goo yes yes ariva ariva
uh excuse us for a second
alright just what the hell do you think you are doing
what am i doing just having some fun cholo
cut the crap i thought we were here for lawsuit money
just keep your mouth shut and do what i tell you
if we are staying here then i want to know what is going on dont forget i know who you really are mitch conner
if you know whats good for you youd keep your mouth shut kid
youre a no-good swindler and a too-good thief we were here for money not goo
think about it muhammad is the only person in the world who cant get ripped on those celebrities want his goo
yeah so what
you know what the goo is worth on the open market hell i got people in hong kong wholl give me 50 mil for that goo
so we let them take it from muhammad then we take it for ourselves
you catch on quick kid
mrs lopez
hurry get my wig back on
hey i was just seeing if you needed some- oh god you found my fudge packing uniform
oh yes your secret is safe with me tommy
boys we are so sorry for doubting you you really did bring us muhammad
thank you so much for coming muhammad
welcome
oh is that okay
i dont know
alright now we just need to figure out how to get muhammad from the back of the truck into tom cruises limo
what no dad we promised that muhammad would stay in the truck
cruises lawyers were very specific boys hes sending a limo for muhammad to meet him outside of town
but muhammad cant be seen dad
alright well put a sheet over him
no you cant even show his feet
how about a halloween costume with one of those plastic masks
no you could still see his eyes
okay how bout like like a big mascot outfit one that covered him completely head to toe not even showing his eyes
muhammad would that be okay
okay
tom rob weve just received word from the lawyers south park is saying they have muhammad for us
rob will the machine be ready
oh itll be ready
more tacos
i want more tacos
no no more tacos mrs lopez

you walk away now and you will regret it the rest of your life
screw this conner find yourself another partner
then i guess i wont tell you about your father
my father
thought that might get your attention you know nothing about your dad right
i know enough my mother is a hermaphrodite so she is actually my father
you really still believe that garbage the people in your town sold you that line come on youve had to have doubted it all along
how could you know anything about who my family is
heh i know all about the swindles and schemes in this dead-end town you got lied to kid by the people who were closest to you i can prove it too but im going to want something in return
if youre making this up to keep me around conner then youd better-
you just take me where i tell you and when you learn the truth you will learn to trust me and nobody else
okay people try to evacuate in an orderly fashion geez
mayor we do not have the resources to deal with this situation a full evacuation is impossible
jesus what are we supposed to do
we have to give in to their demands
im sorry muhammad but we are going to have to give you over to the gingers
we cant give him over to the gingers
yeah we said wed take care of him
but our homes and our lives are at stake
we made a promise to jesus
stan jesus doesnt matter when muhammad is involved
thatll be tom cruise
helllo
yeah so whats going on
uh im afraid we cant well we cant give muhammad to you
what do you mean youre not givin him to us
there are these ginger fundamentalists saying that if we dont give muhammad to them theyre gonna bomb us
gingers
gingers aww hell no
please understand that we have no choice here mr cruise
youre going to give muhammad to gingers instead of us just because they are threatening you with violence
well yeah
oh we can play that game too you want to see violence well you got it
goddamn stupid assholes you want to play rough ok spielburg go and get some automatic rifles well go in there and were going to take muhammad by force and then we are going to show them th-
tom tom we cant be seen getting violent
yeah that would kill all our careers
but the only way we are going to get muhammad from south park now is by getting just as violent as the gingers
fine then lets have her do it
her who
you know her
oh right her
there she is tom barbra streisand
my god shes even more terrifying than i remember
tom barbra streisand hasnt been active for a long time are we sure we want to do this
