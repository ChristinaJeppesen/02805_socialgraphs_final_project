okay sweetie
all right people we can move onto issue number 14b
mayor we have got to do somethin about all these potholes on our roads
we dont have it in the budget to fix them right now
well wish we spent the money when we have a lawsuit on our hands
we-
you cant go in there
please i have to talk to you all right now
kid were have a city council meeting
mayor something very big is happening and if you all dont give me a moment of your time there may be no more south park to council over
what are you talking about
im talking about the end of all life as we know it for the past several days ive been noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town at first i thought maybe it was just a coincidence then i saw this three new drum circles have sprouted up here here and here theyre all growing in diameter at a rate of two hippies per hour what this means is that the hippies are conglomerating theyre thriving if you will i think that theyre setting up for a hippie music festival
a what
its its simple science look when hippies start to nest in a new area it draws other hippies in with the right weather conditions and topography it can lead to a music festival one that lasts for days even weeks reggae on the river woodstock burning man they will all pale in comparison to what were looking at now in my professional opinion i think were looking at a full-blown hippie jam festival the size of which weve never seen
kid what the hell are you talking about
i know hippies ive hated them all my life ive kept this town free of hippies on my own since i was five and a half but i cant contain them on my own anymore we have to do something fast
uh eric were were talkin about potholes right now mkay
its not potholes you need to worry about its potheads i know what these people are capable of
johnson get him out of here
what are you doing you have to listen to me you cant sweep this problem under the rug the town is in serious danger
you see the corporations take their profits and invest it in the war machine while keeping everyone blind
right so how do we get back at them
yeah were pissed off
well so my idea was this lets have like a week long music festival draw everyone here and then together we can tear it all down whoa what the hell
i knew you were trying to have a hippie jam festival all right everyone pack up your crap were going to my basement
cartman what the hell are you doing
oh jesus not you guys what happened were you bit did you eat their brownies did you eat their brownies
no
listen youre my friends but if youve been compromised ill have no problem taking you out id expect the same from you
what is your problem get lost little eichmann
oh my god
what the hell are you doing
everybody get in a single-file line
there you are
ah officer barbrady youre just in time these college know-it-all hippies were setting up for a music festival just as i predicted
eric cartman you are under arrest

you let them out jesus we have to find them
oh no youre coming downtown

who was that
what did i do
you cant kidnap people and lock them in your basement
theyre not people theyre hippies
is this problem under control
i handled it mayor gee whiz
mayor mayor i confirmed the data the hippies are going to have a massive jam band concert
i know i signed the permit
you you what
i signed a permit allowing them to have their concert here their little "festival" should pump some money into our economy
theyre hippies they dont have any money does the city council know about this
they dont have to know i can sign whatever permit i want
you just sold out our town
that kid really needs some psychiatric help
yeah
all right lets go
how much money is enough mayor how many peoples lives it is all worth god damned hippies
this is a south park news special report

uh huh hi eric uh hows it goin

eric you were right about the hippies could you get rid of them for us now
let me guess theyve started a hippie jam band music festival
we we need you to take care of them eric theyre out of control
forget it
please some of our kids are in there we should have listened to you earlier
yeah we apologize
please dont let them ruin our town
its too late even if i did agree to help theres too many of them now
we know you can do it eric youre smart wha- why youre the smartest kid in school mkay
were just asking you to try the whole town even got together and and baked you a cake
dont think that you can buy me with presents unless of course its the new tonka radio-controlled play bulldozer
its yours
i want the batteries for it too and i get to drive it around in the school parking lot
fine
anything else
yes kyle doesnt get to have one ever and he has to watch me drive mine around the school parking lot and get super-jealous
well we can promise not to buy one for kyle but we-we cant make him watch you play th- oh yes fine well force kyle to watch you
all right fine but now listen up and listen good ive never tried to get rid of this many hippies before so im gonna need every resource this town has and even if i dont succeed and its a million-to-one shot that i will i still get the tonka radio-controlled bulldozer and get to play with it in the school parking lot where kyle has to watch me and be super-jealous because he doesnt have one are we clear
wow this band is so crunchy dude i need more weed
so it seems like we have enough people now when do we start taking down the corporations
yeah man the corporations right now theyre raping the world for money
yeah so where are they lets go get em
right now were proving we dont need corporations we dont need money this can become a commune where everyone just helps each other
yeah well have one guy who like who like makes bread a-and one guy who like l-looks out for other peoples safety
you mean like a baker and a cop
no no cant you imagine a place where people live together and like provide services for each other in exchange for their services
yeah its called a town
you kids just havent been to college yet but just you wait this thing is about to get huge
all right everyone listen up the hippie jam band festival is now fourteen miles in diameter and five hundred thousand hippies thick
my god
in less than three days all of south park will be completely consumed our only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd and reach the heart here if we can reach the stage we can upload this slayer cd into their music system hippies cant stand death metal if everything works they should disperse just before they consume us all
nice plan kid except theres one giant flaw that hippie crowd is massive how the hell are we supposed to get through it and reach the stage
we drill ive designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd the pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside
youre actually suggesting that somebody drives right into the heart of that mob its a suicide mission
not just somebody i need a complete team to operate this vehicle along with me im gonna need a scientist an engineer and of course a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong
im the only scientist in town
im your engineer
honey no
i have to do it steven
all right then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong lessee anyone would do anyone who meets the qualifications lets see oh i know how about-
yeah yeah i get it fine
i i cant believe were actually listening to this this is a crazy plan
you got a better idea steven dammit my son is in there
theres no more time for ideas we have to have this vehicle up and operational in less than three days look its a long shot but its also the only shot we- got
tom im standing in south park colorado where a desperate attempt to save the town is underway some call it a suicide mission but the heroic men and women of the hippie digger may be our only hope of survival
well i guess this is it sharon
please save our boy randy
butters if anything happens to mommy i i want you to be a good boy
ah i will mom
now now dont cry ladies everythings gonna be fine
i dont want you to worry about me clyde frog hey youre the best stuffed animal ive ever had

uh excuse me excuse me can i have your attention please what are we doing its been nine days doesnt it seem like we should accomplish something
were using the power of rock and roll to change the world woo
maybe instead of complaining about corporations being selfish we should look at ourselves i mean is there anything more selfish than doing nothing but getting high and listening to music all day long
hes right its time for all of us to focus our energy and get this hippie jam into full swing
come on come on
