yes sir if youre looking to move out of the city i think your family would love south park you can get four times the house here that you can get in the city a cortado is that like a coffee yeah we – we have a coffee shop here yes
were up in the mountains about an hour from denver do you think you could drive out from the city this weekend and i could show you some properties oh you have a tesla oh how nice
south park – yeah its a charming country village if youre able to work from home i think youll really love it out here lacroix the sparkling mineral water yes i do believe we have that in our stores here
were seeing a massive influx of city people moving out here to the country and the truth is we dont have enough real estate agents to keep up with all the demand
well i dont have much experience but i thought id give real estate a try
mrs cartman being a real estate agent takes a lot of intellect and a lot of raw talent you have to get your picture taken get people to like the picture and go "oh id like to hang out with that person" and then act like you like those people when you show them houses
well i do believe im good with people and the truth is i need to do this for my son ourrent is going up because of all the new people moving into town – and i dont think i can afford it anymore

theyre too smart for us south park realty group we tried to keep up took our pictures again—aagh my spine is broken
well it serves you right for what youre doing to our town
youre driving all the city people away
not ussouth park realty groupthey upset the natural balance real estate agents dont really do anything if they start doing stuff then the whole housing market goes crazy
where is south park realty group located
theyre showing a house the tolkien house you have to stop them
agh help somebody call child protective services
eric youre only making it worse
i am not doing a co-brokering deal mom its not gonna happen
this isnt about that eric and you know it youre upset youre upset because you dont want your mom to have a job
that isnt true
it is true youre scared and youre jealous that a job will take my attention away from you
you just want to offer the sellers a lower commission to list this house and its not going to work mom
its ok to be scared eric i know that im the only family you have but youre making everything worse for us
i see one theres a real estate agent right there
theres a big one and a little fat one
eric you need to stop this right now
when i close this deal mom im gonna be the richest kid in town
it doesnt work that way eric you arent going to make any money—youre just driving up the market and none of your deals will make it through escrow
well well just see in 30 days wont we except for some of my deals which have a 45 day contingency period
fine eric will you stop all this if i quit my job
and you wont get any other job
no
and your only job will be me and youll be home when i get back from school and have my mid-afternoon meal already on the table
yes ericyes
hold yer fire come on out ya damn real estate agents
dont shoot i am not a real estate agent i am quitting as of right now and south park realty group is no more
we did it we fucking did it
real estate is a delicate balance it has to be left to the professionals theres a great migration happening all over america and if we do it right everyone ends up in a homethat they can afford
i think its cool we live in a hot dog we have everything we need here weve got running water a couch to sleep on and most important we have each other
weak i live in a hot dog
