oh thats funny thats real funny big harry and mike in the morning talkin about the new hit movie a great comedy starring and
i saw the movie last night big harry and it made me laugh so hard this movies about a heh he was suddenly all like aw man its great
big harry and mike in the morning well talk more about it but lets get to some music the new tween wave band with their song
coming this fall to fox/cbs/fx jurassic park and lost in the same tv show dinosaurs lost humans future yes
stanley eat your waffles
oh shut up cartman you dont even know what youre talking about
oh yeah i saw it on the news kyle the school is gonna make us all get shots again but this time its so that we dont get warts in our vaginas
(are you serious)
yep
thats only a vaccination for girls stupid
then why are they sayin that gettin vaccinated at school is gonna make us all retarded
because some people think vaccinations can give you autism or aspergers
wait what
thats what theyre talking about on the news
wait theres a disease called assburgers
yes
you are so lying theres no disease called fuckin assburgers
you wanna bet lets go ask my dad right now
okay youre on jew
and so children at noon today all the girls will go to the gymnasium for their vaccinations and boys will head on out to recess
do the girls get their shots right in the vagina
no butters thats not how it works
mr garrison these three boys were caught playing hooky
did you guys know theres actually a disease called assburgers
sit down boys well talk about this later right now were talking about vaginal warts
this isnt fair how can the school make us get vaccinated
you mean little hamburgers grow in your butthole
thats right its a butt fungus
well i dont want burgers comin out of my butt
god shut up everyone just shut the fuck up
mkay stan you youve gotta try and pull yourself out of this mkay i know that your parents recently got divorced mkay thats gotta be hard i know thats thats bad but when you walk around all mopey mkay and sayin everything is just shitty well thats called bein a debbie downer stan and nobody likes a debbie downer mkay i mean youve gotta youve gotta snap out of it debbie come on debbie youre even bummin me out now mkay your attitude just- just sucks
i just want everything to go back to the way it was
okay well thats not gonna happen debbie okay you know uh life life has to change mkay
how when all the things that made you laugh just make you sick how do you go on when nothing makes you happy
huh e-excuse me a minute stan mkay uh hi ms bronski did we vaccinate stan for the flu last year we did uh oh i think hes got aspergers
this is breaking news from cnn or fox or whatever fuck you
the first documented case of a child developing asperger syndrome from school vaccinations has put the government in a tight spot at a press conference today the media heard from the young boys father steamy ray vaughn
its pretty shitty when you work so hard to be a great parent and then the "government" comes along and with one shot turns your child into a "mentally incapacitated" freak i mean look at him hes disinterested depressed self-loathing its most likely the reason his mother and i got divorced
in response to the embarrassment the president of the united states has passed "stans bill" putting an end to school-mandated vaccinations
mr president the bill is ready
just sign right here mr president
aaand if you could just sign this one as well mr president
it is yet unknown if any other children have contracted from the vaccinations but if so multimillion-dollar lawsuits are probably not far behind
turn on your heart light let it shine wherever you go let it make a happy glow-
eric what is it this time
fever light lightheadedness i dont know whats wrong with me

we all know why we are here theres a rebellion in our midst and it must be squashed out we have to put an end to cartman burgers
yes yes but what do we do
at kfc weve seen a 50% drop in sales
its worse at pizza hut cartman burgers choked out the market
what makes them so good for whatever reason these cartman burgers satisfy the taste cravings from all of our restaurants
there lies the secret its the chemical compounds from all our flavors pizza hut burger king kfc all somehow infused into one burger
its as if hes somehow taking all the ingredients of our food breaking them down into some kind of gas and them somehow infusing that gas into his hamburger what kind of instrument could he be using to do this
it would have to be some sort of super dutch oven
but a dutch oven with greater technology than weve ever seen
aughah
hey wake up come on now wake up use the smelling salts
enchirito
