weve all heard of rudolph and his shiny noseand we all know frosty whos made out of snowbut all of those stories seem kind of gaycuz we all know who brightens up our holiday
mr hankey the christmas poo
small and brown he comes from you
sit on the toilet here he comes
squeeze in tween your festive buns a present from down below spreading joy with a
mailman and kids
hes seen the love inside of you cause
mailman and kids
sometimes hes nutty sometimes hes corny he can be brown or greenish brown
mmm-mmm
but if you eat fiber on christmas evehe might come to your town
mr hankey the christmas poo
he loves me i love youtherefore vicariously he loves you
i can make a mr hankey too
howdy hoim mr hankey the christmas pooseasons greetings to all of youlets sing songs and dance and play now before i melt away heres a game i like to playstick me in your mouth and try to say
"howdy ho ho yum yum yum"
christmastime has come
sometimes hes runny
sometimes hes firm
sometimes hes practically water
sometimes he hangs off the end of your assand wont fall in the toiletcuz hes just clinging to your sphincterand he wont drop off and so you shake your ass aroundand try to get it to drop into the toiletand finally it does
mr hankey the christmas poo
when christmas leaves he must leave too
