he put up a hell of a fight but we got him

oh he will my little poopsiekins is a very good little boy

this body also had a missing hand and a bowl of corn flakes next to it
which can only mean one thing
ha you see
that a copycat killer is on the loose we need your psychic abilities to catch this new guy right away

if im happy and i know it clap my handsif im happy and i know it clap my hands
eric sweetie theres um some people here to see you
more people need to make use of my phenomenal gifts huh ahhh its so very tiring
ah no these people claim that they are the "real" psychic detectives
so you are the little boy whos been taking all our work
oooh ill go make some tea
kid we have a problem you didnt go through the proper channels to become a psychic detective like we all did
yeah
proper channels
you were supposed to fill out the form on the back of the comic book and pay the twenty five dollar fee for the degree from the psychic detective school
i was given my gift from a tragic accident i didnt need to go to psychic detective school
well you just cant say youre a psychic detective you have to use the ad in the comic book
you must pay the twenty five dollar fee and give us ten percent of your earnings
ten percent my balls get lost
very well then you give us no choice roger
all right everyone
oh goodness whats going on
stand back mother were having a telekinetic battle of minds
o-o-o-o-oh
enough we are obviously quite evenly matched i guess this will have to be settled in court
in court
we brought a class-action lawsuit against you well see you before the judge tomorrow
is it over
her name is veronica crabtree bus driver for the elementary school she was considered an ancillary character one the fans wouldnt miss much
jesus christ cause of death
same mo sir multiple stab wounds left hand cut off and missing
so youre telling me somebody new is now copying the crimes of the copycat killer jesus where will it end every time i put a killer behind bars another guy just steps in and takes his place what am i doing wrong
excuse me sir i think i know who did this we saw this guy at the last crime scene and and you know how serial killers sometimes return to the scene of the crime well i followed this guy to his house and when he left again i collected some fingerprints and did a blood-sample analysis im pretty sure hes your man
how do you know are you psychic
no
look kid dont waste my time with your blood-sampling fingerprinty hocus-pocus i have to find this new killer now i owe it to that victim over there i know she hadnt been in any recent episodes but dammit she deserved better than this come on murph weve gotta talk to eric cartman again
why wont anybody listen to me
(dont take it personally kyle)
i am taking it personally because cartman is a retard just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesnt mean hes a- wait thats it if i want people to listen to me i just have to be as stupid as cartman
dude i really dont think thats a good idea
there has to be another way
be sure to take me to the same hospital
now kyle dont fly too close to the sun or itll burn your wings an- and youll crash into the ocean
butters goddammit
all right here we go since the days of copernicus man has dreamed of flight on this historic day we remem- aw screw it
call an ambulance
multiple arrests were made today for the murder of hillary neals police raided the south park motel 6 at 4 am where seven psychic detectives were staying the psychic detectives horrible crime was found out by psychic detective eric cartman who is now the only psychic not behind bars what an amazing coincidence
cool ah kyle is at the door come in kyle who are you

kay sweet
because of you nobody knows the extent of my deeds
oh yeah awesome hold on just a second mom theres some homeless guy here make him go away
hey hey whats goin on
you are obviously a big fan of my work

but i am the serial killer the one whose rightful place in history you have smirched
oh jesus
and now you will have a place of honor as my nineteenth victim
no no you dont wanna kill me please ill give you anything you want
before you die let me show you the things that ive done so you will understand the breadth of my transformation this is me at the grand canyon do you see this is me at mount rushmore do you see
heheh
do you see
yes yes i see
here i am at the alamo in san antonio this was just outside of the gift shop do you see
aaaaaaah
dammit dammit all to hell they just found another body that means a fifth copycat killer is on the loose wheres my psychic
sorry sarge the psychics mom says her son hasnt been home for a couple of hours
sir dr kels just called from the hospital he says another little boy just awoke from a coma and is having psychic visions
lets go
this is the young man here he was in a coma for over sixteen hours
doctor could you remove his face warmer wed like to speak with him
of course nurse
young man the doctor said youve had some visions about our newest murder
i see a man with a baseball cap hes killing now oh im seeing it all flash before my eyes the guys name is michael deets and he lives at 621 castillo street hes usually there between seven and eleven pm
what do you think mitch
i dont know how do we know this kid is really psychic i mean this boy is certainly no eric cartman
all right well check this deets guy out but lets use that one thing that we never use
sir
you know whats that one thing that starts with an r that we never use
restraint
yeah yeah restraint well check this guy out but lets use some restraint
look look at the things ive done here i am at yellowstone national park do you see here are pictures of my trip to cheyenne for frontier days do you see
oh god im so bored somebody help me
good evening sir were park county detectives we were just wondering if we could take a quick look around your house misterrr
god
well mr god it wont take but a second it might help us with an investigation
(hey come over here)
i see you like cutting the eyes out of photos of women my son is a big fan of that too
sarge in here
jesus h that boy was right arrest that guy whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo oh wait a minute no ah im wrong
sir
this isnt the guy the serial killer always cuts off the victims left hands
right
well those arent left hands see on your left hand the thumb faces to the left those are all right hands
ohhh
nope this isnt our man were sorry mr god it appears weve wasted your time
(hey help)
heh pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall heh no wonder that boy thought he was a killer
yeah amazing coincidence
heh- sir
call it police intuition but somethin in there just didnt feel right wait a minute
sarge what is it
im not sure im gonna have to run some tests
murphy do you remember what i was supposed to be doing
oh uhhh oh something about hands sir uh for the serial killer
oh right the hands right
oh my god murphy youre not gonna believe this
thats it no more pictures time to die
no please im sorry i gave other people credit for your killings ahah it was it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested
your hand will be one with the others
please just let me go ah im gonna tell everyone im not really psychic ive learned my lesson please i dont wanna- i dont wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you
hold it right there killer
you got here just in time he was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability
well young man you did an amazing thing not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer but a lot of innocent people are out of jail
yes thank you very much kyle
yes thanks
youre certainly a better psychic then eric
no dont you see cartman never had psychic visions and neither do these people the plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic theres a logical explanation for every psychic story youve ever heard
do you think thats true
it must be true the kid is psychic but i dont suppose it really matters much because in the end the way i caught the killer was with good old-fashioned police work come on murphy
well young man i guess that just leaves one score to settle
you cant hurt me
then let this be our final battle
just stop it stoop iiit theres a logical explanation for that
