we really didnt have a choice since the fulfillment center opened me and my wifes coffee business has gone belly-up

howdy folks
in these warehouses there are over one million items from toothpaste to go karts and its the work of both humans and machines that make the work possible youll get a message on your device which item to get then get it to one of our loaders and the machines do the rest

aaaarargargar
whenever theres a workplace accident you need to fill out a 1081 form
what are you doing
(what you scared me guys wassup)
"wassup" is i thought we agreed bike parades are stupid
(bike parades are stupid)
dont lie kenny you saw that larry kid scoring chicks with his bike heard about the cash prize and you decided to do the bike parade behind our backs i know cause i thought the same thing
me too
jesus is this really what its come down to you guys whatever happened to *us*
what do you mean
it used to always be the four of us always now stans moved to a farm i have anxiety kenny nobody really talks to kenny and then theres just kyle we used to do everything together what if we did this like the old days
four bikes one common theme
we could totally own the bike parade
(yeah)
if we order everything online we can have it delivered tomorrow we need props pyrotechnics the works
yeah and we gotta order some badass spokes and those wheel bumpers
ill start looking for costumes what theme are we thinking
kenny get on your moms laptop and start ordering streamers sparklers and rockets make sure everyone ships next day delivery this is gonna be just like the old times you guys
workin me fingers to the bone i need me a drink before goin homebe back in the mornin pack boxes at dawn workin for amazon
can i have a beer please whatcha got on tap
amazon amazon light and amazon ipa
gimme amazon light im a prime member
what the fook are we doin anyway breakin our backs loadin up forklifts gettin paper cuts from boxes and for what a measly paycheck that just barely covers our online purchases
yeah well we should be thankful we even have jobs huh before the fulfillment center opened we really didnt have anything
we had our dignity
hey everyone everyone listen amazon just posted a statement about joshs accident theyre calling it "human error" "amazon regrets the recent workplace accident and is working to better train its workers so that no future accidents occur"
who do they think they are
it was the bloody machines
okay hold on everyone im sure theres an explanation
this is what weve been reduced to we are the backbone that makes the fulfillment center work maybe they should see what it would be like if we didnt show up for work
well do it for josh and so what happened to him never happens to anyone else
hold on guys m-my son has a big bike parade coming up i i cant just not show up to work now
whats more important to you stotch a bike parade or josh
a bike parade
amazon workers we are on strike
my stuffs here my stuff my stuff my stuff my stuff my stuff
mornin hon
shut up stuff stuff mom were there a bunch of packages for me
i dont think anyones getting packages sweetie look
the amazon fulfillment center has been shut down as hundreds of employees refuse to work customers all over the state are wondering where their amazon orders are as workers demand more respect and more money the uprising started with a workplace accident which amazon blamed on human error joining me now is the victim of the accident - josh carter and josh how does it feel to have your accident spark so much upheaval
you know tom i think something like this was bound to happen theres those at the top who control the means of production and then theres the working class that enables those means by selling their labor power for wages when theres conflict the ruling class tries to blame the working class
can you get out of the box
no my organs have been compacted so if the box opens i spill out and die i believe the working class needs to revolt against capitalism and bring about socioeconomic emancipation
do you get hot in the box
ship to address order now "usually ships in" four to six weeks i can make my own damn towels in four to six weeks
mayor you have a visitor
not now im having problems
but mayor its uh jeff bezos
founder and ceo of amazon jeff bezos
yeah
okay okay uh let him in
right on through here mr bezos
mr bezos how great to see you again how have you been
i wish i was doing better please mayor have a seat
oh thank you
i guess youre here because of the strike
we had a deal mayor you told me this town would be the perfect place for one of our fulfillment centers
and it has been it it gave so many people jobs and im not really sure why everyone is so
disgruntled dissatisfied unamused would you like to know why amazon is so successful because the customer is all that matters now orders are going unfulfilled all over the state of colorado that makes us look very bad it makes you look very bad perhaps you should no longer be a prime member
please i-im trying to get everyone back to work i-im going to do everything that i can
then we have an understanding goodbye mayor if everyone stays unfulfilled it will be you who pays the price
unfulfilledand now tomorrows nothing but another daysomebody came and took my hopes and dreams awayand now im lost and unfulfilledcurtains closeall we were a distant memorysomebody just bitch-slapped the smile right off of meand here i am so unfulfilledthe happiness i knew just got raped and killedand all i am is unfulfillednothing that i have seems like enoughall im left to ask is "wheres my stuff"its sitting somewhere unfulfilled
anything did you get anything
(no nothing)
i guess its time to face it we arent going to get our stuff
maybe if we reorder everything and have it shipped to a different fulfillment center-
theres no time lets face it we cant be in the bike parade
no i refuse to believe we have no other options um what what did we do before amazon
(well i dont know)
i mean before we could get whatever we wanted where did we get stuff
at the the ma- the ma-ma- the mall
oh yeah the mall
(the mall)
guess we havent been to the mall in a while
sweet lovehear me callin out your namei feel no shame im in loveoh no no no no no(sweet love)
theres nobody here
theres gotta be somebody
look its wiener on a stick
uh hello
welcome to wiener on a stick
are you the only one still at the mall
there are many and yet none
there he is
dad
how did it go
they voted to keep striking there was a run-in violence between some of the strikers and corporate theyve decided to punish us by taking our status theres no easy way to say this so ill just come out with is then were not amazon prime members anymore
then what are we
everyone involved in the strike has been dropped down one level from prime were were now amazon usda choice
thats fine well be usda choice its its almost as good as prime
youre a good woman for saying that but youre a bitch because its a lie and youre patronizing me
mom eh if i win the first prize in the bike parade ill give the money to you guys
please i dont know what else to do my family is all that matters to me i made a promise to provide for them what if we never get what were asking for from the strike what if they just get others to do all the boxing for us
see how the worker begins to question his determination without his amazon prime status he fluctuates between being and non-being
my family has to come first
now torn between memberships the consumer-worker will reason that the strike is pointless prepare a bus we must make sure that boxers who wish to box have a safe way into the fulfillment center
i think maybe it was a bad idea to come here you guys
why have you come to this place
we came because we need stuff
do you seek cosmetics
do you need puppies
sample of lotion
what
why its lemongrass lavender
no no no look we need very specific stuff theres a big bike parade on saturday
ohhh bike parade
bike parade
ohh
ohhh bike parade
thats nice
yeah and the four of us are actually doing a group theme
the changing faces of immigrants in america as told through bicycles
so do you need shoes
yeah uh color-coded specific shoes in four specific sizes
aww
what
we do not have the inventory that online wholesalers can provide
this is a waste of time you guys
(yeah shit lets get the fuck out of here)
please you are the only customers weve had the pleasure of assisting since the fulfillment center opened
h-hold on a minute you all stay here cause you want to work
it is our purpose
our purpose
our purpose
wait a minute you guys i think i have an idea
a bus with employees wishing to return to work is about to arrive here at the fulfillment center and the strikers are not happy also dozens of amazon customers have shown up angry customers who wish to be fulfilled
we want our stuff we want our stuff
the customers say the boxers need to return to work because the shutdown is hurting everyone
i have a weed business to run i need my shit from amazon to make it all work
at what cost sir do you care that personal worth is being reduced by capitalists to exchange value
oh yeah thats typical rhetoric from a marxist box
free trade is not free-dom perhaps socialism is the answer
if you pay for shipping can you go anywhere you want
here comes the bus
scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs scabs
hey its stotch
ya cant do it stotch ya damned us all
dont you understand its not about me its my son
if those orders get fulfilled then we got nothin
hes just a kid he wants to be in the bike parade
my sons in the bike parade too hes got little tassels off the back of his seat tiny flags stickin out the handlebars but he deserves more stotch if we dont make our stand now he doesnt have a chance hell get fookin third or fourth place or just a fookin participation ribbon
im sorry
stotch
it is not as i expected only one consumer worker broke through the picket lines your townspeople are more stubborn than i thought
theyre prideful people yes
perhaps i should give up how i long to return to bezos and touch butts with my wife amazon fulfillment center
uh yeah hi we ordered a bunch of stuff and we havent gotten it
yes yes the workers are striking were fucking working on it
no thats actually why were calling we know a whole bunch of people who can come work for you
is that so now those fools will pay
what fools will pay
uh no sorry um you say you have worker-consumers willing to box
yeah but listen we want our stuff we ordered a bunch of shit for the bike parade and if we get you workers we want them to deliver our stuff first
very well stay right where you are you didnt tell me there was a bike parade
i didnt think it was relevant
everything is relevant when it comes to customers
the history of this world
is the history of class struggles
alienated from the products of their labor
from their fellow laborers and from their very essence
the oppressed worker will eventually strike back at those capitalists who control the means of production
we have nothing to lose but our chains
we will unite in revolution
and if others try to break through the picket line
nothing else can be allowed into the fulfillment center no matter what the cost
were ready to follow you josh
then follow me to hell
