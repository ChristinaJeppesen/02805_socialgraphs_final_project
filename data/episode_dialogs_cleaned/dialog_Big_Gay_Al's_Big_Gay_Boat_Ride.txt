mr garrison can i ask you a question
well of course stanley what is it
whats a homosexual
hoh well stanley i guess you came to the right person sit down
stanley gay people well gay people are evil evil right down to their cold black hearts which pump not blood like yours and mine but rather a thick vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior do you understand
i guess
good im glad we could have this little talk stanley now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual
you guys see me block that defense today i was kicking ass
youre gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the cowboys
hey speaking of pounding ass here comes stans little homo dog
