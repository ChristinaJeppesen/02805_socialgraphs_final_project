craigs show
what is that butthole doing now
oh its brilliant its all just video footage of animals close-up with a wide angle lens
animals close-up with a wide angle lens
but thats thats crap thats not even tv
its what the students want and its cheaper to make than your show just one person and a video camera craig is a genius uh-sorry kids
but mr meryl were trying to bring the news to the students they need to know the facts and our news team delivers them very much
kids dont care about the news boys its boring kids wanna see animals close-up with a wide angle lens
please mr meryl but the news is our life without it we have nothing
im sorry kids y-y-you should be proud of what youve done its just that its kind of gay
youre gay
gee whiz we sure worked hard on that new show
apparently it doesnt matter how hard you work
hello boys ready to do some whistlin
fuck off whistlin willy were not in the mood

god i wish we had a pizza hut in south park
hey look craig just walked in
yeah
hey look its craig
hey craig over here
geez all that from a stupid video show
oh hey guys heard about your news show being cancelled
go play with yourself craig
yeah well ive got an overall deal with the school heh theyre paying me six dollars a week to come up with new shows
your idea took about this much thought craig
this much more than you had
hey a round of root beers for everyone on me
(woohoo)
kenny what the hell are you doing with this asshole
(craig just asked me to do his show geez)
youre helping craig make his show i cant believe you would betray us like that weve always been supercool to you "hahahahahaaahaaa were gonna do a news show and you cant do it with us because you are too poo-oor and poor people dont watch the new-oos nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa" ah whatever kenny
hey gang i brought the new episode of wide angle close-up animals
put it put it up on the monitors
cuuute super cuuute
gah i just dont get it
wow those animals are pretty cute
token now come on guys we worked too hard to just roll over for craig and his stupid overall deal instead of sitting here feeling sorry for ourselves we just need to figure out how to make our show better
yeah maybe if we can get higher ratings by the end of the week theyll let us stay on the air
well what are we waitin for
come on guys
all right we all need to come up with ideas for our show
how about we revamp the name super school news sounds dry
it should be sexy news
action news
yeah sexy action thats good
maybe the problem is we dont have very good stories to report on
right we should make up stories because theyll be far more interesting
hey yeah uh why i could say i saw celebrities even though i didnt a-a-and then lie about what i saw them doing
nice butters write that down
lie about celebrities
we have to appeal to all the students so we we need hot girls for the sixth graders
and panda bears for the preschoolers
good
maybe we need to make students think they have to watch our news show or theyll die
yeah we should make up a bunch of reports about how dangerous it is to be alive
oh boy
fellas are you sure all of this is eh-ethical
were in fourth grade jimmy we dont even know what ethical means
all right sexy action school news team its time to go to work get out there and get some stories
sexy action school news team ho
ah tolkien can i have a quick word with you look tolkien i-i know the guys are having trouble bringing this up with you but uh well the thing is tolkien we we really need to revamp your whole tv persona
huh
you see tolkien people really enjoy seeing african-americans on the news seeing african-americans on the news not hearing them thats why all african-americans newspeople learn to talk more wha- how should i say white tolkien all the great african-americans news people have learned to hide their ebonic tribespeak with a more pure caucasian dialect theres no shame in it and i think itll really help our ratings
this is south park elementary school closed-circuit television and now time with the sexy action school news
is south park about to explode from a methane gas leak more on that later but first stan marsh has a look at some new outfits for the raisins girls
woohoo
eric the outfits are even skimpier than before leaving very little to the imagination no doubt that if i were a little older i would be aroused
woowhoowoo
and now for a look at the weather here is tolkien black and tolkien i hope theres no tornadoes headed our way
no tornadoes eric but interestingly enough there is a low-pressure storm moving in over the park county valley should bring us some chilly days ahead
the park county school board has approved a bigger budget for the computer lab up-
oooo hang on jimmy it looks like kyle has the dish on some students bathroom habits kyle
eric sources are speculating that third-grade student pete thelman pees sitting down like a girl weve also got confirmation that sally turner stuffs her bra and clyde donovan has only one testicle
one testicle what an asshole
uh-oh looks like its panda bear madness minute
oh yeah panda bear madness and now lets get a look at the celebrity watch with butters
this isnt the news this is a tr-tr-tr-tr-travesty
all right so after my report on the unsanitary conditions of the school cafeteria were go to kyle for the story on brian teeves trying to make out with susan farkle
then lets do tolkiens report on how global warming is going to kill everyone in the fifth grade
that is a terrific idea stan a-okay
fellas fellas i got fant-tastic news the vice-president dick cheney was in denver yesterday and i got an interview with him for our news show
oooo interview with the vice-president hmmm frankly jimmy i dont know how were gonna fit that in between cheerleader pie-eating and whos got skidmarks monday
but this is real news
its boring news jimmy
how do you know you you havent s-seen it yet
all right tell me about it
well in the interview mr cheney tells me all about how the-
aww ohh god i just got so sleepy im sorry what were we talking about
look fellas ive got a real problem with the direction our news show is going were dumbing down the school
no jimmy the school is already dumb were just giving them what they want
were making the news more appealing to students
this isnt the news this a b-b-bastardized quest for ratings damnit we have a journalistic responsibility to bring students the fa the facts dont you see what weve done in our efforts to compete with craigs small-minded show weve made a mockery of n-news reporting i remember when we all made an oath to each other way back when started playing news reporter that we would never let anything jeopardize our integrity well our integrity is jeopardized and if we cant report news the honest way what good is n-news reporting
boys first of all i want to tell you how impressed i am with your ability to get more ratings your show beat close-up animals with a wide angle lens by three viewers
all right woohoo awesome
i knew we could do it
we beat close-up animals
oh man this is so great we we worked so hard to be on top oh oh comeere you
yes but unfortunately you got crushed in the ratings by craigs new show
craigs new show
all the students love it its an incredible idea called close-up animals with a wide angle lens wearing hats take a look that craig is a freakin genius i tell ya hes like an idea machine
does does this mean were still gonna get cancelled
im afraid its worse than that boys im gonna have to give you all fs in extracurricular av class you have to learn now how important ratings are
hey wha-b-but we gave it our best
yes and i guess your best wasnt good enough
i dont believe it
i cant lose this extracurricular credit i need it to pass fourth grade
stupid news hair
fellas dont you see this proves my point we have to elevate our ideas up not down
yeah jimmys right i know we can come up with way better ideas than craig
yeah to save our show all we need to do is come up with the best idea for an episode ever
what if we do a show where we- uh no
how about we have us um hmmm
come on doesnt anybody have any show ideas
well how about we get panda bears and we have them dance around with us
we did that
wow coming up with ideas is hard
look you guys if craig can do it we can do it come on how about we do a show with us ughhh
uhhh what if the-
wait ive got it crab people
crab people
theyre like half crab half people and they live below the ground

so dagwood says "good guh-good thing were playin uh the back nine at your house"
were hopelessly stuck completely out of ideas
we have crab people just sayin
wait you know what we should do we should all take a bunch of cough medicine
cough medicine
thats what the sixth graders do behind the school at recess they take way too much cough medicine because they say it makes them see things in their heads
gee whiz there sure is a lot of em
how do we know which one to use
how about this one calminex "warning taking more than the recommended amount can cause severe side effects"
that sounds perfect
b-b-bingo
can i help you boys
uh yeah we need to come up with some ideas and inspiration so were gonna drink a bunch of cough medicine
whoa boys thats not what you need to come up with ideas
its not
no what you want is calminex pm it has the dexatrimfan in it that causes hallucinations in large doses
oh okay
now if its more of a lucid speedy kind of high youre looking for i do also carry the daytab cold and flu then theres the maximum-strength cortitussin cough and cold but of course thats only if you really want to trip balls
