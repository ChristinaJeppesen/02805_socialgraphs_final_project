thanks for having us all over for dinner chris and linda
yes it was fabulous
oh were just really happy that your boys have become such good friends with our little butters
yeah we figure that if our boys are gonna be great friends we should all get to be friends too
friends by default
well our boys do seem to be spending a lot of time together lately i think ever since their friend kenny died theyve been looking for someone to fill the void
well our son is a perfect void-filler its nice that he finally has your sons to be his best buddies
look you guys butters is asleep
hes such a douchebag
hey have you guys ever seen this trick when someones sleeping you can take a glass of warm water and you put their hand in it
yeah and then what
and then you pee on it heheh-heheheheheheheh
no dude youre supposed to put their hand in warm water and it makes them pee
oh really oh well heh heheheheh heh
and we were thinking since theyve all become such close friends how great it would be for us to all go together to aspen for a ski weekend
a-aspen uuuh we we cant really afford that
no you see linda and i found this ad where you can get two night free at a condo in aspen if you attend a time-share presentation
they let you stay for free
yes and all we have to do is attend a thirty-minute meeting
well that sounds like a good deal
sounds good to me lets go this weekend
oh boy skiing in aspen i cant wait
hey boys were all going to aspen for the weekend

so last night while butters was asleep i gave him a hitler
whats a hitler

yeah well thats why they call it asspen
all right little dudes great to see you out here my name is thumper and im gonna be your cool ski instructor
his name is thumper
were gonna take it slow take it easy make sure everybody has a goood time cause what is skiing about having a good time thats right now just a few safety things to keep in mind first of all look straight ahead when you ski you look down youre gonna fall youre gonna have a bad time also be aware of skiers around you you run into another skier your skis are gonna cross gonna have a bad time
so wheres the part where we have a good time
hey little dude you got some crap right here

that sounds like a great investment opportunity
i-im sorry but none of us can really afford to own our own vacation condo
yeah and to be honest were just doing this meeting because of the two nights free deal
oh i know thats what everybody says - "not me i cant afford it" but what if i told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars
wow
for only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here
well you see "time-share" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves you "share" the condo with other investors and pick the "time" you want to stay
share time time share
so then its not really ours
sure it is one twenty-fourth and a half yours you see time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say "ive got a little place in aspen"
try it try saying it "ive got a little place in aspen"
ive got a little place in aspen
rolls off the tongue doesnt it say guys howd you like to tell that hot secretary "ive got a nice little place in aspen" hahaha just kidding wives

thank you

this isnt about you kyle i have to do this okay i have to
and so you see its the investment opportunity that keeps on giving
how many times do we have to tell you this we dont want to buy shares in a condo
and we certainly dont want to pressure you
pressure us you kept us all day yesterday and then had a chair lift bring us back
heh-ey you can leave anytime you want of course that is if you dont want the super-secret fun prize for attending the slide show
no we dont want the super-secret fun prize alright we just wanna ski come on everybody
i know have you ever considered going in on a time share
thats only a couple thousand each josh
dont listen to em lets just go
my god can you believe those people
i hope you dont blame me for all that i mean the ad did just say a thirty-minute presentation
lets just get out of here
folks im glad youre back because we forgot to mention time-share condos are still deeded properties
aaagh
oooo you folks really lucked out this time youre visitor number one thousand
that means you can listen to our special offer for privileged members only
that does it im calling the police
mr ski instructor i need a lot of training fast im gonna race down the k-13
k-13 but youre just a beginner you ski outta your league youre gonna have a bad time
i have to do this okay i have to
alright well if you gotta get good at somethin really fast theres only one way to do it come on
the day is approaching to give it your bestyouve got to reach your primethats when you need to put yourself to the testand show us the passage of timewere gonna need a montage (montage)a sports-training montage (montage)and just show a lot of things happenin at onceremind everyone of whats goin on (whats goin on)and with every shot show a little improvementto show it wont take too longthats called a montage (montage)even rocky had a montage (montage)in any sport if you want to gofrom just a beginner to a proyoull need a montage (montage)a simple little montage (montage)always fade out (montage) into a montage (montage)if you fade out it seems like a long time (montage) has passed in a montage (montage)montage (montage)
all the ad said was that we had to attend a thirty-minute meeting right and- and its been a day and a half these guys wont let us leave
thats not true officers we said they could leave at any time
all right let me see if i got this straight you two gentlemen are offering part-time limited liability ownership in one of your fabulous condos for the one-time price of eight thousand dollars
thats right
sounds to me like if anybody should be arrested it should be you people for passin up such a great deal
thats right youre practically stealing condos at that price "book em danno"
oh jesus
no no
the police work for time-share too
the police the mayor the president of the united states perhaps now you see the severity of your situation i think we shall all sit down and listen to the presentation
sit
now youre probably asking yourselves "can my time-share condo turn into a profit"
"what kind of cash flow can i realize from my investment"
the answer might astonish you for over ten years investors have seen their-
the powder is fresh and the stage is set for tad versus stan on the k-13
this time youre not just gonna lose youre gonna die
i cant lose another friend first kenny and now stan all im gonna have left are you two douches
ready set go
pizza pizza pizza
tads got the lead
come on stan
haha this should slow down darsh a bit
and it looks like tad is way out in front
now ill win for sure
awgh dude i cant look
lets see what some sand does to your speed darsh he doesnt stand a chance now im gonna beat em
the race is half over and tad is still out in the lead
heh when darsh skis by here ill let all these hamsters go that should distract him just long enough for me to win the race
oh tad
what are you doing up here
oh nothing i just thought i could distract you with these
good job dude
thanks
you did it stan
thanks a lot stan now were gonna be able to keep the youth center
well that does it looks like the spirits of the wakichaw indians can finally rest in peace
stan i was wrong about you would you like to go out again
go ahead stan shes everything you ever wanted
there you are boys
mom dad
where the hell have you guys been
uh we got a little held up at the time-share sales office
yeah but the good news is we finally came to our senses and bought some shares in a condo so we all get to come to aspen for two weeks every year
awwwwww
whats the matter didnt you boys like skiing
no we cant keep track of when you pizza and when you french-fries and when the hot-shot asshole skier takes your girl or if youre supposed to race him the first time or train first to beat him on the really difficult mountain so you can save the dorky but hot girls youth center skiing sucks
yeah what a stupid sport
i heard that you were the one responsible for making tad lose the race thanks
yeah well he really flipped when he saw these
quaid
start the reactor
