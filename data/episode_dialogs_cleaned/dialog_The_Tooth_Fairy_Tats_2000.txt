what are you talking about cartman were only $167 away from gettin a sega
i know
cartman whats going on
you guys oh god i dont even know how to tell you this
tell us what
you guys theres theres no tooth fairy you guys there i said it
what do you mean "theres no tooth fairy"
my mom has been giving me the money all this time and your parents are the ones who left you money
dude
that cant be my parents wouldnt lie to me
but now my mom has given us so much money that shes bankrupt and were poor like kenny dont touch me kenny
youre wrong if my dad says something is real then its real
kyle open your eyes man
its not true
oh hello son
dad there is so a tooth fairy huh
what oh kyle lets have a little talk
oh my god you did lie to me
no kyle shes just make-believe like peter pan
peter pan too
kyle
what about moses and abraham
well they were probably real
probably is atlantis real
probably not
wahahahah
look kyle adults make up those things because theyre fun for children
fun for children fun for children look at me dad i dont even know whats real anymore weaaaah
man i cant believe all our parents lied to us about the tooth fairy
what about dan rather do you think hes real
no man thats just a tv show
you guys you guys i figured it out
what that your parents lied to you too
yeah but its okay we can still get our sega dreamcast
how
look the tooth fairy is all made up right
all made up not real nothings real
so all we have to do is go to a really rich kids house put our tooth under his pillow wait for his parents to leave him a whole buttload of money and then sneak back in and take it
(woohoo)
the kid will never even know
oh dude that is tits i mean that is big fat oprah tits right there
oh my god what if im not real
we can take the bus to the city theres super-rich people down there
yeah
i mean what if im just part of my parents reality
come on kyle
what if this is all just somebodys dream
wow look at the size of these houses
totally dude cherry creek is the richest part of denver ill bet these kids get at least ten bucks a tooth from the "tooth fairy"
hey that house looks perfect theres obviously kids living there
there you can tell this is the kids window cause its got mega man stickers on it cartman once youre in the kids room leave the tooth under the pillow then come back out well wait for the parents to see it and leave money then swing you back in the house to grab it
got it
this is the smartest business venture ever
what the-
hey what the hell are you guys doing
were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kids pillow then come back and collect the tooth fairy money that his parents leave him
hey you cant do that
why not
because thats what were doing
yeah you ripped off our idea
what the hell are you talking about weve been doing this for over two years
two years
nice tooth fairy costume you think anybodyd believe you in that
its better than your dress you look like a bad jennifer lopez nightmare
how dare you
look this is our turf youd better scram before the boss breaks your legs
you scram we were here first
whats going on oh its the tooth fairies
oh nice going now you woke him up
you woke him up
i dont have any loose teeth miss fairies but i have been a very good boy
shut up
alright that does it come on were going to see the boss
whos the boss
loogie
my associates here tell me you were working cherry creek tonight is that true
uuh yeah
right on our turf boss i aint ever seen that kind of disre- erp
we were there first
kids have been doing the tooth fairy racket in this town for years i do it just like my big brother before me and my oldest brother before that
damnit and we thought we were so original
let me ask you something you were gonna sneak a tooth under this rich kids pillow then what
well uh-what do you mean
how are the kids parents gonna know there was a tooth under their childs pillow
ha you guys dont even know how the tooth trade works
whats a "tooth trade"
look any shmuck can sneak through a window wearing a pretty dress the tooth racket is much more involved we keep careful track of what houses weve hit so that we dont hit the same one twice in less than two months inside the house we not only have to sneak a tooth under the pillow but leave a note for mom and dad to see this is how we let the parents know to leave money under the pillow once the note is in place in the last house we start all over going back to the first house but this time all we have to do is collect money and the kids never know what hit em
wow
the hardest part is getting teeth we tried various places cemeteries hockey games anywhere we can find them
nooo
the teeth we do manage to acquire are then sorted according to size color and quality but theres never enough teeth never enough
amazing
man that is tits
and now my only problem is what do i do with you
rowwr
tell you what how would you like to run the south park tooth racket for me
oh uh-i dont know
its that or else i can cut off your penises
hm work for you have my penis cut off work for you have my penis cut off hms see
cartman
how much do we get if we work for you
ill cut you in at 2%
two percent have my penis cut off two percent-
were in
fellow dentists as you all know we are still having numerous reports of missing teeth from all over the country there are also reports of missing tooth fairy money we believe that there can be only one logical reason for all of this a giant half-chicken/half-squirrel that steals either teeth or money from children as they sleep in order to build some kind of giant nest for its genetically superior and potentially dangerous offspring we believe also that this creature would have at least a mild understanding of algebra and that it-
uh excuse me i think i have a more logical theory
yeah weh well by all means mr foley enlighten us
i think what weve got here is some kind of black-market tooth racket something where one group is stealing the money and teeth from another group for a profit
oh mr foley you realize how ridiculous that sounds
its not ridiculous its very possible ive seen it happen before
where
in montreal
and where pray is this "montreal"
look i know how to handle this all we have to do is bring down the kingpin and the rest will fall youll see ill have it taken care of in a matter of weeks
uhyub-dub very well mr foley you go on your wild goosechase and meanwhile well deal with the real problems at hand
well i will
anyway the half-chicken/half-squirrel would most likely be about three to four-and-a-half feet tall his large beak is probably detachable and works as a flotation device
here here over here look look what i got- i got from the chef
hello there children
hey chef
