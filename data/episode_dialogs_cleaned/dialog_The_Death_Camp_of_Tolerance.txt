i wanna come clean with you and tell you that back then some of us were uncomfortable with your sexual preferences it was wrong of us and i want to make it up to you
wow thats really great to hear

youre sure this is for real i mean im not gonna just get fired again for being gay tomorrow

yeh-you dont say well thanks uh principal victoria holy moly ive gotta find a way to get fired for being gay
mkay kids i know the past few weeks have been really hard with the death of your teacher ms choksondik

okay children now for those of you who are new my name is mr garrison

well i was informed that fourth graders are a little too old for mr hat
two-year-olds are too old for mr hat
but its okay because i found a new teachers assistant say hello to mr slave
hi kids hm
so thats mr slave the teachers assistant or as i like to write for short the teachers ass
oh jesus christ
okay mr slave go sit until i need you
ugh
dude i think that mr slave guy might by a pakistani
im not saying the rest of the school year is going to be easy in fact its going to be long and hard really long and really hard
oh jesus christ
eheh the first thing were gonna be learning about is communist russia
no kenny what are you doing kenny
now stalin was a big silly when it came to
kenny no dont do it kenny
eric did you just throw a paper airplane
no it was kenny
very funny eric kennys dead

oh-oh oh it hurts
i will not put up with tom foolery in my class room children mr slave put this rubber ball in your mouth take that slavey take it thisll get me fired for sure
i really enjoyed the imagery in the last chapter of this months book
yes and i really saw the entire book thematically as a take on corporate america
well i think in the fourth chapter when uh nancy drew discovers the bloody glove in the cheerleaders locker well that uh that was just a brilliantly written passage
so full of metaphor
hey guys can we talk to you
oh hi boys
how was school
uhh not cool
thats great were having our book of the month club meeting so why dont you boys go outside and play
was it me or did you all think that nancy drew solved the riddle of elephant mountain a little too easily
no no he said not cool we got our new teacher today its its mr garrison our old third grade teacher
uh huh
well he has this new teachers assistant and uh and theyre both totally gay
kyle you know better than to discriminate against homosexuals
yeah but these guys are really super-gay
aw im surprised at you stanley i really thought you knew how to accept people for who they were
yeah but dad-
no buts stanley were not raising our kids to be discriminators
thats right i think its time you kids took a little trip to the museum of tolerance
welcome to the museum of tolerance here we try to educate you on the dynamics of racism and prejudice in america
ey
now did you know that words we use can show intolerance lets begin our tour with a walk through our tunnel of prejudice to show you what it can feel like to be discriminated against
queer beaner chink n*gger heeb faggot cracker slope
aw man this is awesome
now you know how it feels
i wanna ride again i wanna ride again
we are now entering the hall of stereotypes these wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon a stereotype that hurts the african-american community what other stereotypes do you see here
ah heres the arab as a terrorist
thats right but of course we know that not all arabs are terrorists dont we kids
w-w-well theres an asian over there with a calculator
thats right not all stereotypes are negative but even a positive one like "all asians are good at math" is harmful to society
look a covetous jew
very good young man the idea that jews are only interested in money is very old indeed
ah heres a good one its the stereotypical "sleepy mexican"
wai-what oh man what time is it
oh im sorry i thought you were a wax sculpture
naw man im the janitor im spose to be cleaning but im so tired ongh so sleepy
this is our discovery wing take your time at the computer displays because you see being tolerant you must also learn to respect people who are small people who are disabled even people who are overweight like this young man here
ey
you other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby" or "lardbutt" or "fat tits"
"fat tits" thats a good one
yeah i have to remember that
but you must learn to be tolerant of his differences as well if he chooses to eat fatty foods thats his life choice
im not fat i have a different life choice
and we wont belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies
duhuhude tolerance kicks ass
thats our cartman
well thats the end of our tour
now do you see why tolerance is so important boys
i guess
we have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do hey what the hell are you doing
oh i was just uh-
theres no smoking in the museum
but im not in the museum
get out of here you filthy smoker
yeah dirty lungs
go ahead and kill yourself stupid tar-breath
dumbass
get out of here
well have a great day everybody
now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve right
yeah
okay children lets take our seats uh apparently none of you tried to get me fired yesterday so i guess were just gonna have to go on and learn more today now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the bunsen burner
it evaporates
good butters now if we take the glass tube of the bunsen burner we can also see how other things react evaporation is an exothermic reaction so lets look at an endothermic one mr slave position 7 please now im gonna put the glass tube under mr slaves tight ass the heat from mr slaves ass will act as our new conductor of energy
aah
okay now butters could you bring over lemmiwinks for me please
sure
oh no no no no no no
newton was the first to discover that for every action theres a reaction - thank you butters now what do you think is gonna happen when i introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of mr slaves ass well lets see
aah aah dude jesus christ aah
lemmiwinks no
hello there children
hey chef
hows it goin
bad
why bad
chef were intolerant
intolerant of who
gays i guess
now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people children i thought you knew better
well we didnt think we were but mr garrison has this new assistant and were really uncomfortable around them
children a lot of times the reason people get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves you have to ask yourself "what is it about their behavior that for some reason makes me uncomfortable"
well i guess its mostly the way mr garrison stuck a gerbil up mr slaves ass
right and you see children thats why you need to- whoa what
are we homophobes now
we dont wanna be gay bashers chef
children theres a big difference between gay people and mr garrison do you understand that
n-no
you children just take your lunches im gonna have a talk with the principal
ill take three lunches today please
you dont need three lunches eric youre fat enough as it is
it is my life choice chef and if you dont tolerate it ill report you to the sec
that was a brilliant idea having me put a gerbil up your ass mr slave now well get fired for sure
well it wasnt the first small animal i put up my ass
mr garrison to the principals office please
thats it theyre gonna fire me for being gay twenty-five million here we cooome
dont forget i get half oooooh oooooh jesus christ
lemmiwinks you must find a way out of this place or you will surely die this way has been closed off by the great sphincter to escape you must journey upward to the dark reaches of the intestine and past the stomach who am i just a friend heed my words lemmiwinks your time is running out make for the large intestine all will be made clear then

you wanted to see me principal victoria
oh yes uh mr garrison have a seat
oh dear sounds like im gettin fired
mr garrison chef has brought it to my attention that some uh students are a bit uuuncomfortable about certain aspects of your teaching methods
oh no youre firing me oh well i cant stop being who i am i cant help the way god made me guess i just have to go
no no no were not firing you
youre not
no were sending chef to a tolerance seminar
sending chef to a tolerance seminar youve got to be fuckin crazy
you demonstrate a lack of tolerance for mr garrisons behavior in fact i believe you used the words "sick queer" to describe his conduct in class
he is a sick queer
yeah
i just wanted to give you an opportunity to apologize to mr garrison before i send you away chef
kiss my black ass
parents i had to call you in here because your boys have refused to attend class with their homosexual teachers mkay
were not staying in class another minute with those queermos
well i really thought you boys learned something in the museum of tolerance but apparently all you learned was new words to call your poor teachers
but they killed lemmiwinks
shut your mouth butters youll speak when spoken to
yes sir
mr mackey weve done everything we can to raise compassionate children we dont know where else to turn
well there is an intensive seminar camp its a bit severe but it might be the only way mkay
that sounds good to me
me too
then its settled boys youre going to tolerance camp
tolerance camp
welcome to tolerance camp you are here because you would not accept peoples differences because you refuse to accept the life choices of your fellow man well those days are now over here you vill verk every hour of every day until you submit to being tolerant of everybody here intolerance will not be tolerated
god-damnit
howd it go
this is unbelievable mr slave it seems no matter what i do i cant get fired
the principal didnt fire you
no the parents felt so bad that their kids didnt want to attend my class anymore that they wanna give me the courageous teacher award this friday at the museum of tolerance
oh jesus christ
i mean i stuck a gerbil up your ass and they wanna give me a goddamn medal
well it sounds to me like the principals just hiding things from everybody what you need to do is let the parents see what kind of demented faggot you are
oh well- hey thats right mr slave the parents have to see for themselves the awards ceremony well well put on a show theyll never forget
oohoohoohoo jesus christ
