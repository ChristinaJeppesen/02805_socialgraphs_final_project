a cartoon a cartoon is about to air on american television with with the muslim prophet mohammad as a character
so
so stanley mohammad is sacred to the muslim people ever since those cartoons in denmark the rules have changed nobody shows an image of mohammad anymore
which cartoon is it what cartoonll be so insensitive as to have mohammad as a character
who do you think the cartoon thats always pushing buttons with their careless toilet humor family guy
awww
how could family guy do that
why would family guy so blatantly insult muslims
because family guy doesnt care who they insult they only care about their precious money
oh come on people you really think anybodys gonna be that pissed off about a cartoon
wu-weve got the tv working
once again a cartoon depicting the muslim prophet mohammad is set to air tonight on family guy
oh randy hold me
the news has already sparked a shockwave of protests throughout the muslim world all over the middle east muslims are burning american flags and family guy posters muslim terrorist al-zawahri made this statement
we are so super pissed off at family guy family guy isnt even that funny of a show a jihad on family guy and the family guy nation
so what happens now
we stay here through the night wait it out to see if they do anything if were still alive in the morning then well know were not dead
its okay
were alive were alive
everyone everyone listen fox network censored the image of mohammad at the last minute
oh thank god
well it looks like weve dodged a bullet
they censored the image of mohammad how
i tivo every episode we can go to my house and see what they did
okay you guys check it out
you tivo every episode of family guy
dude its a good show
yeah lots of people like family guy
yich
peter i cant believe you invited your old high-school sweetheart over for dinner
you think thats bad remember when i auditioned to be david hasselhoffs car
bgcolor="beige"
bgcolor="beige"
yeah but dad why would you invite an ex-girlfriend to dinner
perhaps he wants to make our mother nervous
nervous like when i had to sell pancakes to the school soccer captain
bgcolor="beige"
bgcolor="beige"
bgcolor="beige"
hehaha heh
yich
but peter i dont wanna cook dinner for your ex-girlfriend
well maybe we can just have tea
you mean like the time you had tea with mohammad the prophet of the muslim faith
bgcolor="beige"
bgcolor="beige"
oh boy was that ever weird anyway i cant believe i invited my old sweetheart to dinner huh
thats it thats all they did
oh man thats not cool seriously that is not cool
what whats the big deal
whats the big deal you guys they just made fun of the religion of an entire group of people what you guys think thats okay do you care at all about peoples feelings
since when you care about being sensitive to peoples religion cartman
yeah you rip on peoples religion all the time
thats different im just a little boy thats a cartoon millions of people watch it how would you feel kyle if there was a cartoon on television that made fun of jews all the time huh
uhhh
im telling you guys its wrong its wrong its wrong
kyle kyle what are you watching
hey brian this is like the time i got a job as a carrot cake
gaaah its family guy quick gerald do something
dad dad jesus christ
its okay its dead
you boys know youre not supposed to watch that careless show
mom it was nothing mohammad just stood there and then drank some tea
you boys dont understand anything its obvious that you all need muslim-sensitivity training
welcome to muslim-sensitivity training it is important for us to understand why the muslim feel the way they do and why we can never show an image of mohammad
no muslims cant show an image of mohammad
kyle youre not being very sensitive
yeah kyle maybe you think this is funny but the rest of us dont
lets all look at why muslims are upset first of all in the muslim religion youre not allowed to have what sex good theres no sex until marriage in the muslim world now this would be fine except that in the muslim religion you also cant anybody jack off okay jacking it is strictly forbidden in the muslim religion and what do we know about the places muslims live they live in good sand now put yourself in the shoes of a muslim its friday night but you cant have sex and you cant jack off theres sand in your eyes and probably in the crack of your ass and then some cartoon comes along from a country where people are getting laid and mocks your prophet well you know what id be pretty pissed off too
mrs garrison that is ignorant and racist muslims are mad because of family guy not because they cant jack off right wendy
yeah
attention students proceed to the school gymnasium immediately for an emergency announcement
the hells going on now
shh quiet students quiet
once again we have just learned that the family guy episode featuring mohammad was only part 1 of a two-parter and part 2 is going to air next week with mohammad uncensored
what
why would they-
fox studios claims that the family guy writing staff has demanded the mohammad character be seen in full view the head of fox had this to say
family guy is our biggest show if they insist we dont censor their work then we we cant
family guy i damn you to hell
once again bitter riots have started in the middle east this time even more massive and terrorist leader al-zawahri has issued a threat
seriously family guy isnt even that well written the jokes are all interchangeable and usually irrelevant to the plot when this episode airs-our retaliation will be massive
retaliation oh my god mkay
goddamned family guy now theyre just provoking people its like they want a holy war
does this mean we dont have school all week
you guys this is serious we have to do something
(like what)
we have to go to the fox network in la we have to go and try to get that episode pulled you guys with me
dude we cant go anywhere theyve shut down the airports and the buses
then well ride our big wheels
to los angeles
if thats what it takes yes we have to talk to the network the family guy writers arent gonna back down
well good for them they shouldnt the writers are standing up and saying they arent going to be intimidated
intimidated is that what you think this is about kyle
all right dude what the hell has gotten into you i dont trust for one second that your sudden concern for the muslim people is real
all right fine kyle forget the muslim faith for a minute people can get hurt if ten people die because family guy just had to have their little joke will you still think its funny what if a hundred people died will it be funny then kyle im going to los angeles im gonna do whatever i can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand somebody has to speak for the muslim people somebody has to speak for whats right
kyle kyle wake up we have to go the terrorists are attacking
dad are you sure this time
this isnt a joke kyle bombs have already gone off in six cities
no
wait a minute wheres ike
he was just here ike
ike
ike iiike ike
ice cream and chocolate
ike this way iiike
kyyyle nooooo

come to try and stop me it isnt gonna work
i didnt come to stop you i i think youre right cartman i want to help you get the family guy episode pulled
yeah well i dont need a partner on this especially one who doesnt trust me
look cartman i dont know whats gotten into you but i i think its pretty amazing and i think its real you have to understand why i didnt believe you before
yeah i do understand kyle ive been doing the wrong things for a long time doing things for my own selfish reasons i just wanna do something right you know just this one time
its a long trip dude youre gonna need help we can try and get the episode pulled together
you know we might not even make it into the studio
i know but just like you i feel like i have to try people can really get hurt and a joke just isnt worth that
so what made you change your mind
i got some sound advice from an old friend
well kyle wed better get going
yeah
are you set
im set lets do this
all right lets roll
people people quiet please we must not panic
well what are we gonna do mayor part 2 of the family guy episode airs in six days
i believe that professor thomas from the university has come up with a solution
thank you mayor now look everyone muslim terrorists and extremists are threatening us for what family guy is going to do because theyve wrongly grouped us together our only hope is to make the muslim extremists know that we had no part in the mohammad episode that even though the episode aired we didnt watch it we didnt hear it and we didnt talk about it
so how do we do that
we bury our heads in sand we take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks fill them with sand from monarch lake and then dump the sand along south park avenue by using approximately eighteen dozen shovels we can each dig a hole in the sand stick our heads in the holes and then have the person to our left bury them if we can manage to get every persons head buried deep deep in sand before the mohammad episode airs we could avoid looking like were responsible for any part of this at all
no no wait a minute thats ridiculous what we need to do is just the opposite freedom of speech is at stake here dont you all see if anything we should all make cartoons of mohammad and show the terrorists and the extremists that we are all united in the belief that every person has a right to say what they want look people its been real easy for us to stand up for free speech lately for the past few decades we havent had to risk anything to defend it but those times are going to come and one of those times is right now and if we arent willing to risk what we have then we just believe in free speech but we dont defend it
i like the sand idea
yeah me too
yeah the sand thing sounds a lot simpler
were gonna need eight dozen shovels and sixteen tons of sand lets move people
we got six days to make it to los angeles if we keep our stops to a minimum we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time
yes and in just a few weeks from now family guy will be off the air forever
off the air but were just going to try to get the mohammad episode pulled
its simple television economics kyle all it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled if we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of muslims then the catholics can demand a show they dont like get pulled and then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled and so on and so on until family guy is no more its exactly what happened to laverne & shirley
whoa whoa wait a minute this isnt what i signed up for i like family guy why do we have to get it off the air forever
because they made f-fun of muslims and and thats wrong
but that doesnt mean it has to go off the air you should like that show your sense of humor is just like family guy
dont you ever ever compare me to family guy you hear me kyle compare me to family guy again and so help me i will kill you where you stand
you unbelievable son of a bitch you never cared about the muslim religion or the safety of people in america you just want family guy off the air
do you have any idea what its like everywhere i go "hey cartman you must like family guy right" "hey your sense of humor reminds me of family guy cartman" i am nothing like family guy when i make jokes they are inherent to a story deep situational and emotional jokes based on what is relevant and has a point not just one interchangeable joke after another
what are you talking about
you dont understand
i cant believe i let you scare me into taking your side you used fear to make me stop believing in free speech
well i guess you wont be helping me now no biggie i dont need you to get the episode pulled
no i am not letting you go to that television studio and pretend to care about safety and sensitivity to get a show you dont like off the air
well then kyle i guess we- oh my god is that tim mcgraw
what cartman
kyle stop it
holy crap
ahhh
stay on em jesus mary
if you have children be sure to bury their heads in the sand before you bury your own
dad i dont wanna bury my head in the sand
its the best say stanley did you eat your fruit roll-up
yeah
all right make sure your snorkel is working all right now get your head in the hole
dad this is stupid
stanley theres no time for your immaturity do it all right sharon now do me
uh professor we all just thought of somethin if everyone has their head buried by the person standing to their left then whos gonna bury the last persons head
yes im afraid one person is going to have to be last and not have his head in the sand
ill do it
dylan no
you realize by not burying your head in sand youll appear to be a part of the family guy audience
yes i know
dylan please you cant
somebody has to do it sarah you run along now and you get your head in the sand ill be all right you have to understand im all she has
who are those people
no aaaah aaaah
hahahaha so long kyle
you son of a bitch i wont let you win you hear me
suck mah balls kyle
are you the network president
yes mr president
we need to discuss this family guy episode mr president
mr president my hands are tied the family guy writers insist i dont censor mohammad
but mr president this is a matter of national security they must be reasoned with
mr president theres something about the family guy writing staff i think you should know
next week on south park the race continues cartman reaches the family guy studio and learns the shocking secret behind the family guy writing staff
this explains everything
as an entire nation buries its head in sand
the idea has swept the nation but where will we find enough sand for everyone
and the battle between good and evil is finally waged
kyle quit it stop it kyle
will the cartoon be allowed to appear uncensored will family guy be destroyed will television executives fight for free speech or will comedy central puss out tune in to see part 2 of family guy next week on south park
