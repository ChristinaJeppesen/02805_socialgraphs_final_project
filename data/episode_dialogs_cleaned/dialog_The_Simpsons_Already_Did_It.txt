what
you know that big statue in the town square of pioneer john wesley powell i snuck over there with a hacksaw and uh and i cut off his head hahahahaa yeah
oh uh
hahaha and theyre probably just realizing that now quick we must turn on the news
but hillary clintons ass just keeps getting bigger also in the news tonight a vandal has apparently cut off and stolen the head of the powell statue in the south park town square
look look ive made the news i-ive wreaked havoc
the head was taken in the early morning hours and the police have no leads
i finally made the world sorry ive brought sadness a-and chaos
this act of course reminded us all of the time that bart simpson took the head of the springfield statue in one of their classic episodes heres what some people had to say
well i i think whoever took the head was really just doing an homage to the simpsons heh i think its great
yes it really made me reflect on that episode and laugh
well the simpsons is such a great show and we need reminders like this to keep us watching
oh uh-m son of a bitch
the police say that instead of looking for the missing head theyd rather leave it off and be reminded of the simpsons every day
well why didnt you tell me the simpsons already did that
you seemed so proud i didnt wanna bum you out
stupid simpsons
hello there phillip i brought you something
oh what is it
see were just watching cartoons like always nothings changed
jesus christ shes dead
stop it tweek were pretending like nothing happened
phillip i think i may have accidentally killed celine dion
killing is never an accident you dickface
oh jeez change the channel
and in other news still no cause of death found for elementary school teacher diane choksondik however doctors say that during the autopsy they did find semen in her stomach
they found the sea men its only a matter of time before they find the women too
the autopsy is ongoing and cause of death is yet to be determined
oh god

simpsons did it
dwaah
there we just put the sea people back in the tank with the others and nobody will ever know the blood is washed neatly from our hands
alright children i got you four tickets to thailand and three hundred dollars cash its gonna be tough living for a while you might have to do things for money you never thought of doin before
its alright chef we got our sea people out of the teachers stomach and we put them back in their aquarium
wait what sea people
the sea people that we put in the teachers coffee
uhh maybe youd better start from the beginning
and then we put them back in the tank
oohhh children you misunderstood sea people is different from se-men
it is
yes that stuff that was in that vial didnt come from you it came from someone else i thought you children took turns rapin and then murdered the teacher
well if they found somebody elses sea men in her stomach maybe theyll find our sea people too
relax children drinkin some brine shrimp cant kill you your teacher must have died from something else
oh really
egh im so relieved gaah-ah-ah

okay goodnight cartman
gnight guys
im so glad were not murderers
ah so great that everything is finally back to normal
hyou guys come quick you wont believe it
oh no what now
those sea men from the teachers stomach somehow combined with the remaining sea people we had left in the tank and ah well look
whoa
how how did that happen
ive been up for hours doing some calculations and ive come up with my final theory of composite dynamics sea people plus sea men equals sea ciety
whoa
theyve already accomplished so much
theyre like bacteria small organisms live much faster lives and do things at a much faster rate
thats right tweek and if my theory is correct all we need to get is more of the two reacting agents and we can really see them thrive tweek
hr
you go and send away for more sea people from the magazine ad get at least five gallons of them here stat stan and kyle you go find a bigger fish tank to put them all in
well what are you gonna do
me im gonna go out on the town and find ten gallons of sea men
ive done it general disarray ive watched all one hundred and thirty-two episodes of the simpsons twice and ive finally come up with something tha they have never done uh behold this device that i have made will take the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replace the inside instead with two-month-old mayonnaise people will think that they are gonna get a bite of a sweet delicious cherry but instead theyll get a mouth full of yuckies and sticky mayonnaise hey youve never seen this on the simpsons right
no i think the simpsons would be more clever than that
good then l-let us take my machine outside and make society finally pay for sh-shunning us
tonight on the simpsons its a laughorama when bart builds a machine that takes the cherries out of chocolate-covered cherries and replaces them instead with mayonnaise
nnno uh no no it cant be

thats nice poopie
and in other south park news elementary school teacher ms choksondiks autopsy has shown that the semen in her stomach belongs to school counselor mr mackey however the semen apparently did not contribute to the death and so mr mackeys identity is to remain anonymous
hey butters
haaa
hey what are you doing man cartman says he has something really cool to show everybody youve gotta come
cartman
ha ha
behold you all see my tiny minions groveling at my likeness i am eric cartman god

be you not jealous jew i am creator of all things yea
that is very impressive eric what do you intend to do with your underwater society
im gonna send a message to my people and tell em to develop a great machine that will shrink me down to their size so i can live amongst them forever
aha ahaha ahahahaha
what the hell is wrong with you butters
they did that on the simpsons ha treehouse of horror episode 4f02 the genesis tub lisa loses a tooth and the bacteria on it starts to grow and makes a little society and they build a statue of her thinking shes god ha hahaha

dude the simpsons have done everything already who cares
yeah and theyve been on the air for like thirteen years of course theyve done everything
