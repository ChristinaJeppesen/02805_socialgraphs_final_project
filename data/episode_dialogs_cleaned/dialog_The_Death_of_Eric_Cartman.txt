he says he love you
oh thats so nice
tell her tell her that i wish i wish i would have been a better son sometimes
he wishes he would have been a better son sometimes
its just that its just that i got so caught up with the rat race of life tryin to succeed that i sometimes took my family for granted
he he got caught he got caught up in the rat race of of taking things for granted
oh thats so sweet oh i love you too poopiekins
kyle eric wants you to know that hes hes sorry for all the times he made fun of you being a no-good stinking jew hes asking for your forgiveness and and he wants you to just remember the good times

uhh alright then
who was that
it was cartman having butters apologize for him
dude he did that to me this morning
(me too)
he probably thinks if he apologizes to everyone well think hes changed and let him back into our circle
(that guy would try anything)
yeah we know better than to think that
okay that takes care of tolkien clyde and mr kitty thats everyone i guess all that leaves is you butters butters im sorry if i ever did anything to hurt you

yeh youre still here
goddamnit what the fuck is going on
well i guess saying goodbye wasnt enough
what else do i have to do
well well you know the preacher says that before your soul can be at peace sometimes you have to atone for something bad you did
atone
did you ever do anything really bad
not really
lets see oh and i broke mr andersons fence and never told him about it
broke fence
i took a crap in the principals purse seven times then there was the time i convinced a woman to have an abortion so i could build my own shakeys pizza i pretended to be retarded and joined the special olympics i tried to have all the jews exterminated last spring uhh oh yeah and theres this one kid whose parents i had killed and then made into chili which i fed to the kid
boy oh boy eric youve got a lot to atone for
really
really i mean honestly i dont know how youre gonna make up for all this
i know how
im gonna make make it rightim gonna take a little time and set things rightmake make it rightim payin for my sins and it sure feels greatit feels so good to be making upfor all the things ive done wrongi know now what the good lord in heavenwanted from me all alongall along im gonna make make it rightcause jesus wants me to have a clean slatenot faking it im making it rightim payin for my sins and it sure feels greatmake make it rightmake make it rightgonna make it right girl ive got to have your lovin tonight

yes butters my soul is finally at peace its time for me to leave goodbye butters thanks for all your help be good and be safe goodbye goddamnit what ive made everything right
oh jeez i i guess maybe your soul is stuck here for a different reason
i want my eternal bliss do you think this is funny god do you think this is funny
eric calm down
stupid butthole god
butters what have you done
i-i-it wasnt me ih it was the ghost
oh stephen i dont know if we should ground him or call a doctor
no i think youd better call a doctor ill ground him
what do you think doctor
your son is suffering from severe dementia he claims that the ghost of a dead friend talks to him this is usually a sign of schizophrenia brought on by some tragic event in the childs past i think its best that we take him to the mental center and do some tests
oh no no
all right butters just try to relax doin just fine butters just stay perfectly still now butters
lu lu lu lu lu lu
good youre gonna feel a little pinch now butters dont worry mr stotch whatever traumatized your son in his past well find it
well after fourteen hours of testing i can say butters is definitely suffering from aggravated repressed memory syndrome you see butters when the brain wants to cover something up it makes up images and sounds for you to hear
so the ghost was in my head the whole time
now do you believe us butters
yes uh yes sir i believe you
good were making a lot of headway well do some more testing tomorrow all right folks lets let butters get some rest
goodnight baby
ahhh
butters
aaaaaaaaaaaaah
dont worry butters im gonna get you out of here
please leave me alone eric my bottom is really sore
i found the woman you need to talk to for me look doctor lindsay expert in the paranormal she can tell us what to do
eric ye-youre just an image in my head brought on by a traumatic event
shes gonna close soon come on
wuh i hate my stupid psychotic brain
hello maam may i talk to you
certainly come in have a seat and tell me what it is you seek
well theres this ghost see only it probably isnt a ghost ih-its just a delusion brought on by my trauma well im supposed to heh help him find out why his spirit is wanderin the earth even though i know that im most likely just completely insane
well many times the reason that the soul stays earth-bound is because god is intending to use that soul for a divine purpose to help prevent an impending tragic event
of course thats it butters we had it wrong all the time
but now you shouldnt think youre crazy young man i see ghosts all the time
really
yes whens the last time you saw yours
well hes sittin next to me right now
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
hey i think she could see you too you really are a ghost
i told you butters
this is breaking news
a tragic event is unfolding in south park three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the red cross
tom the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the red cross behind me and threatened to kill all the workers inside the violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash
oh my god this is it butters this is what im here to stop come on butters this psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day

well we did it butters we saved the day
