wendy i thought my life was going in a different direction and i just felt that i i really had to give it everything i had you know i had i had to focus on one thing
is that why you told clyde that you broke up with me because youre about to be "dripping in bitches"
huh why does everyone suddenly remember everything everybody says
im happy stan im happy i know who you really are now youre someone who cant be counted on youre someone who can just bail on the people you love

yeah all hes gonna talk about is how hes gluten-free now and feels sooo fuckin amazing
well you have to admit he does look a little better
he doesnt look any different to me
in the cheeks you dont think he looks a little fuller
its just the new diet fad
sorry im late i had to stop and get my own breakfast because i figured yall would be having doughnuts but im actually gluten-free so i cant have doughnuts mkay
yes mr mackey were all aware that youre gluten-free now
im just sayin that i personally feel sooo fuckin amazing
can we discuss the gymnasium and get out of here please
right so the issue as you all know is that butters set fire to the gymnasium last week and ran away laughing and flipping everyone off
thats probably gluten mkay
oh god
gluten causes sluggishness irritability and nearly all behavioral problems
i seriously cannot take hearing about gluten anymore
see thats probably the gluten talkin uhkay if you cut out gluten you dont ever get pissed off
really mwell i might just give this gluten-free thing a try how does it work
oh no dont try- oh god here we go
i dont know what were going to do its been like four hours and people still wont talk to us
(right what the fuck is going on)
you know what we gotta do guys weve gotta throw a big fuckin party
(a party)
yeah how do you make everyone like you you have a big party and invite everyone and then everyone thinks youre cool
dude that would have to be like the best party ever
well im down between the four of us we can throw the sweetest party ever and these assholes wont even remember us being dicks to them
hey that might work but it cant be a party for us
right its gotta be an awesome party for
for someone that we love who needs us and that we refuse to bail on
what
no no hes right weve gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go
we lure people in with a cause and then hit em over the head with the best party ever were gonna have pizza and cake and a sweet band
a band holy shit stan didnt you say your dad knows somebody who knows lorde
yeah he said some guy at work is lordes uncle or something
oh my god weve got lorde to play live
(this will be awesome)
so who do we throw the party for
what do you mean we have a friend who needs us right now and we cant let him down
all right that was "get this party started" and joining me in the studio now are four local boys who are gearing up to throw the most epic party ever is that right boys
yeah its going to be this weekend
you know we just wanted to give back to the community and show everyone a good time
now this party is also for a good cause because its to honor a little boy with diabetes scott malkinson is that correct
you you know diabetes affects us all but it mostly affects scott malkinson
yeah and we just- you know we we just cant turn our back on him
must be pretty special having a big party in your honor scott how does it feel

"i actually have plans this weekend im scott malkinson ive got diabetes"
all right well weve got lots of people callin in caller whats your question

nope were gonna have all the pizza you can eat twenty different cakes and lorde is going to play live
all the pizza we can eat
believe it dude
all right this better be good
all right its sure to be a blast phone lines are going craaazy
sweet
next caller whats your question
yes will there be gluten-free options for people at this party
excuse me
well ive been gluten-free for about a day now and i have to say i feel sooo amazing i just want to make sure theres food for all of us
mark in fairplay you had a comment
yeah i agree with the last caller i was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich its like "get your second-hand gluten away from me"
all right all right next caller you got a question for the boys
yeah i swear if i hear another person talking about being gluten-free im gonna piss in their face
what the hell is gluten
hello everyone my name is john garner and im a nutrition advisor from the usda i want to clarify the usdas position on a healthy diet theres been a lot of confusion about gluten lately people saying that gluten is the cause of cancer gluten should be avoided gluten can make your dick fly off but lets set the record straight
make your dick fly off
people believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier but of course thats a bunch of hooey hooey is the preservative found in processed foods that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity you might say "well theres fat in butter too" but thats just poppycock poppycock first came from india and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey the good hooey not the bad hooey so what is gluten
yes thank you
simply put gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away flour is of course just wheat and when you add a liquid to flour you get dough dough that makes breads doughnuts pasta and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy now if we wash the dough of all its starch we can actually distil the wheat down minus the water minus the starch and what were left with is pure gluten not a bio-weapon just harmless flour protein
then eat it
excuse me
if its not dangerous then eat that pure concentrated gluten okay
yeah alright dup dup
oh you see that his dicks flyin off
oh my god these people dont even know hurry you gotta go
oh jesus hey it isnt safe in there get out of there
get out youre not safe
you gotta get out
hurry you gotta go
what about the powerbars the powerbars
yes
hamburger helper
thats all gluten
theres hot dog buns in that cupboard sharon
hey dad i need to talk to you about this party were having
oh my god the wheat thins
its in the triscuits too randy
wait wait ah i might need those
this stuff will make your dick fly off stan
dont forget the freezer
oh god chicken nuggets - breaded frozen burritos - flour ice cream what about ice cream
i dont know look at the ingredients
heavy cream sugar chocolate syrup - no ice creams good for you
all right thats all of it
you sure all r- all right you got those
i can get both of these yeah
all right come on
hey cartman
kyle its all gone theyve taken it all why are they doing this kyle kyle
dude calm down
theres no snacks left kyle they took all the snacks and the pizza and the cake and were not gonna have a party
who took all the pizza and the cake what the hell
kyyyle
yeah get it get it all yeah thats it burn you bastard
what are you doing my farm
son of a bitch did you not know or did you just not care keeyah
theres panic all over the country and youre telling me you dont have any kind of containment on this thing
were working as fast as we can sir
are you sure its gluten that started the reaction
we gave these rats an injection of concentrated whole wheat bread just a short time ago you can see it already having a negative effect
we told people that whole wheat bread was healthy isnt wheat the ingredient in pasta that makes it healthy
no we believe now that thats poppycock
all right listen up we have the obligation to make this thing right and to tell people what is and isnt safe to eat we are the usda without us people would be eating dirt and chairs whatever it takes stop this crisis
cartman come on dude you have to get up
whats the point everyone hates us at school and our partys gonna suck
we cant let our party suck
what kind of epic party can you have without pizza and cake now all weve got is lorde
thats right weve still got lorde you talked to your dad right stan
ill be back
you know what imm gonna miss most pancakes i keep having dreams of aunt jemima shes trying to tell me something but then she just fades away
cartman we cant do this alone you have to get up
theres nothing left you guys the world is upside down things arent gonna get better theyre gonna get worse
yes
hello sir weve had word of a possible gluten exposure in your home may we come in
gluten expohn oh not here
can we come in please
wuh sure
whats going on
well thats just a beer
oh jesus
beer is all wheat dad
shuut up beer is bad for you
were gonna need you to come with us sir dont touch me
look im ok yuh you wanna see my dick
we just need you to be in quarantine for a while until everyone figures out whats going on
no not papa johns i dont wanna go to papa johns you cant make me go to papa jooohns
how long do i have to stay here
until the usda gets control of the situation sir
what am i supposed to eat
its okay theres lots of toppings just eat the toppings
howd you get exposed bagels gravy
beer i didnt know it had gluten
theres always somethin for me it was the soy sauce sneaky sneaky soy sauce
were trying to get a handle on just how much gluten there is out there but it seems impossible to contain
and we have no idea how to tell people to protect themselves
weve been running simulations but theyre problematic because they dont relate to our current schematics here look this is what weve been recommending for the past three years five basic food groups not four we were wrong about that we now realize of course that the largest of these groups weve been recommending is basically poison sir to combat the gluten were trying every possible combination of the four remaining food groups but so far no answers
sir the feds are here
oh shit
tom vilsack
yes
michael taylor fda
yeah thank you but this is a usda problem
anything involving meat and dairy is our problem too
dad dad

theres nothing left i told you
theres plenty of pizza dough
are you crazy
im crazy hungry oh oh fuck its so good i want more its been so long
oh my god you but youre okay
you dont think its a little ridiculous that wheat protein is toxic this whole thing was a setup man
a setup but by who
oh my god we we have to get a hold of someone who could get the word out
maybe papa john can help us if we can get a hold of them then maybe we can-
ng-oh
theres a health crisis going on and its spreading faster than anyone realizes for a long time we ignored it thought it would only affect the poor people who ate eggo waffles and pizza pockets but gluten can attack anyone this is not a time to party this is a time to get serious were calling on everyone to spend this weekend learning about gluten and how to protect yourself and your family because we dont know how much time we have
well all right time for action indeed lets go to the phone lines go ahead caller
i knew you guys were going to bail on the party
were not bailing on the party were just think theres more important things right now
uh huh you guys couldnt get lorde to play could you
all right lets go to jamie in como go ahead
its like ya ya say youre gonna throw the most epic party of the decade and then you rip it away its kind of like telling everyone to go fuck themselves
oh kansas watch the language there next caller youre on the air
why are you doing this party stan was it because you made people mad at school or because you just wanted to be a big shot
i we we wanted to bring people together and help scott malkinson but-
so then at a time when people really need to come together you cancel on em im pretty sure scott malkinson still has diabetes
that is correct yes i do
you couldnt put on the party you were hoping to put on was that it
jesus christ dude
wendy there is a health crisis right now
right and when things change or things come up you dont forget about everything you promised people
we had no idea what to serve people to eat okay were gonna look stupid
thought so
ohhhhhh well all right next caller is eric are you there eric
kyyyle
cartman
kyyyle what does usda stand for aunt jemina said usda has to look at the pyramid
its dinner time on the east coast in less than an hour people are going to die

my name isnt important what matters is that the answer is in the pyramid
the pyramid thats ancient stuff youre talking about are you sure bring up the pyramid
what what is it what is it for

sir we abandoned the pyramid when michelle obama got involved
the pyramid downt work we already tried it
its upside down
