all right this time its me and kenny versus you two assholes
fine
oh dude whats with all the homeless people sir could you move a little please
spare some change
aw dude he smells like kennys house get out of here
you guys thats not cool these people have nowhere to go they dont have food or shelter we have to do something
well dude what are we supposed to do
(yeah what are we supposed to do)
no kyles right you guys we should do something
really
yeah i know what youre thinking kyle and im with you i know exactly what we should do
gather round and witness the glory as eric cartman attempts to jump his skateboard over the homeless
thank you thank you the ramp ready
yeah its all set
he wont make it
excuse me this isnt exactly what i had in mind
all right here we go jimmy
oh aww
yes i did it i jumped over the homeless yes
(yehes)
that was a sweet idea kyle
god damn it that wasnt my idea
all right people we need to come up with answers there are homeless sprouting up all over town what are we supposed to do
well i i short of had an idea
please mr valmer
we could give the homeless all designer sleeping bags and makeovers at least that way theyd be pleasant to look at
oh thats a good one good idea i like it
well i was thinking we could turn the homeless into tires so that wed still have homeless but we could use them on our cars
ohh thats a good one
nice one randy
like it
thats like recycling
all right enough i find this whole conversation to be extremely offensive the homeless arent monsters they are people like you and me
you mean theyve adapted copied our dna
excuse me i am the top researcher of homeless studies for park county i dont know why more homeless people are showing up in town but i do know that we must be extremely careful if we give them anything there could be more

what the hell happened here
thats far enough just march your butts right back out of our town
we just came to ask a question
you homeless or homeowners
were nine
yeah well that makes you homeless so get out of here before you die
look we just need help with our own homeless problem
yeah this jew here made them take over our town
shut up cartman
cartman eric cartman the kid who jumped thirty homeless people on a skateboard
youu heard about that
heard about it they said you could have easily cleared fifty homeless with that jump
thirty was hard enough
oh god it wasnt thirty it was one he jumped over one homeless person with his stupid skateboard and he barely made it over that guy
kyle knock it off were here to find out how to get rid of the homeless not how many homeless cartman can jump
please we just want you to tell us how you got rid of the homeless in your town
well that was easy
the homeless first started arriving in evergreen about three months ago at first there were only a few of them askin for change sleeping in the parks but then more showed up and we realized there was somethin different about them they fed off of our change to the point that they could actually start renting apartments we knew it wouldnt be long before the homeless actually started buying homes and then wed have no idea who was homeless and who wasnt the people living in the house right next door to you could be homeless and you wouldnt even know nobody could trust anybody fights broke out war thats when i started suspecting that my own wife who id been living with for twenty years was actually homeless so i had to burn her in her bed while she slept after she died i vowed i wouldnt let the homeless destroy our town so we came up with a plan to get rid of them once and for all
you son of a bitch you didnt solve your homeless problem you just sent all your homeless to south park
thats right yes
what
i knew it it wasnt because i gave that guy twenty dollars the homeless all came from here
and it was texas who sent them to us people in san antonio got rid of their homeless by tellin them what a great place evergreen was
but then you didnt solve the problem you just moved it
right but we survived
dehhhnyihhhs
