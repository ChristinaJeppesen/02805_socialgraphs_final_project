is this what youre looking for kyle
no i dont think so
(how about this)
no thats a hair dryer
may i help you find something
yeah do you have any "nurections"
any what
i need to get a nurection for my dad
very funny boys go on beat it
why is that funny
dude my mom and dad keep fighting all the time and both of them say its because my dad doesnt have a nurection so i want to get him one damn it what the hell is wrong with everybody
thats the fifth store weve been kicked out of why is it so hard to get a nurection
(i know fucking seriously)
i just want a nurection so i can give it to my mom
what
(well see you guys i gotta go take the bus out of town)
oh where are you gonna go kenny you gonna see your little girlfriend again
(yeah dude she saved me)
dude you spend way too much time with that girl if you dont-
(ach)
oh my god they killed kenny
you bastards
what the hell happened to him
he just ignited
what happened
i saw it from across the street he just caught on fire
okay people stand back give the little burnt boy some breathing room
ive heard about this this is spontaneous combustion but it usually only happens to fat people near open flames
is it contagious
am i going to spontaneously combust
i hope it doesnt happen to me
this is very scary
the people are panicking about spontaneous combustion thats why ive assembled this crack team of scientists to find out the cause of the phenomenon you are the best scientific mind south park has to offer
uuuh mayor im a geologist
right
well uh i dont study human biology i study the earth
look youre the only scientist that lives in this town you have to find an answer before more people combust you do that and youll be the most beloved man in south park
randy randy randy randy
we love you randy
make love to me randy please
wow
marsh im not asking you im telling you find the cause of spontaneous combustion or else
or else what
exactly
dude he looks so peaceful without his little orange coat on
yeah
the lord giveth and the lord taketh away sometimes the giveth seems a little disproportionate to the taketh there seems to be a lot more takething going on but there it is perhaps if more of you attended church on sundays the lord would not have felt it necessary to punish us by takething this little boy…
oh here comes the guilt trip again
now let us pray lord though we have lost neil smith to free agency and steve atwater to the jets still we hope our beloved broncos can bring home another super bowl championship and once again bathe in the glory of your light amen
amen
lets go-
let’s go
broncos
broncos
let’s go broncos
broncos lets go
wow that was short
boys i havent seen you in church lately
well im jewish
youre not too jewish to worship jesus are you
i guess not
good boys how would you like to perform the stations of the cross this friday night
the what
its like a skit where you reenact the death and glorious resurrection of jesus christ
hey resurrection thats what my dad needs
huh
well do it well do it

god must be very angry with us but why how have we angered you lord
well lets see if they combust no could be from the no

or else what
exactly
what
right
wheres our bible
its in the attic with the old lps boys did you notice anything uuuh strange about kenny in the weeks leading up to his combustion ooh what did he spend his time doing
he didnt do anything he was always with his new girlfriend
new girlfriend
yeah he started seeing this girl and he spent a lot of time taking the bus to go visit her what does that have to do with his death
maybe nothing maybe everything
well were gonna go work on getting kyles dad a nurection
yes yes of course ive got work to do what
lets see jesus got crucified then he died then three days later he had his urection lets see theres fourteen stations of the cross now it says we can makes costumes out of sheets
this is gonna be fun
im gonna be jesus
youre too fat to be jesus
oh and like youre gonna do it jew
stan should be jesus
either im jesus or else screw you guys im going home
youre such a fat baby
well i guess you guys can do the stations of the cross by yourselves
all right all right you could be jesus you tubby cry-baby
stick and stones may break my bones but im jesus and you arent
all right all right lets try it again kenny was standing here stan kyle and cartman were walking around him now walk do you feel hot
uh no
damn it how come youre not combusting
come on randy you said we were gonna drink beer and watch the fight
another one another one combusted
no has she been doing anything odd
no she was just on her way to her new boyfriends house
boyfriend and they said kenny had a new girlfriend
this is stupid screw you guys im going home
no i think i might have it
well well well a lot of you came to church looks like were a little "nervous" about this spontaneous combustion thing huh
yeah
well on this blessed friday let us give thanks for stuff and things lord is it so much to ask that you not let us suddenly burst into flame for no apparent reason i mean come on amen and now some of our darling local children are going to perform the stations of the cross
awww
station one jesus is condemned to death by pilate
kyle
ow you can do what you will but i am the lamb of god
awww
phew
station two jesus takes his cross
this cross is seriously heavy oh man this is totally weak
and then jesus disciple peter denies he knows him
peter
i dont know you dude
oh peter weak peter lame but im jesus so ill forgive you i guess
mayor
mayor i have it i found out why people spontaneously combust
why
uh its too complicated to explain over the phone *girlfriend --> dead*boyfriend --> deadcall a town meeting tomorrow
okay if youre right about this marsh youre going to be the most popular man in south park
randy randy randy randy
we love you randy
make love to me randy please
wow
shmuck
station eleven jesus is nailed to the cross
oh this has gone from weak to superweak things cannot get any more weak for me
then a crown of thorns was placed on jesuss head and jesus was all like "thanks"
well this sucks that i have to die but if i die everyones sins will be forgiven so i guess its cool
and then jesus was lead away to mount sinai where he dies and has a resurrection three days later
hi mom
thank you boys blessed be the name of jesus
its a great name isnt it
hey that went really well they really liked it
yeah i told you id be a sweet jesus you guys
aw man at least the real jesus didnt weigh 400 pounds
up your ass with broken glass
this spot looks good
yeah that looks pretty good
okay cool see you cartman
hey wait where the hell are you going
huh i dont know im going home i guess
yeah me too
well get me down from here
cartman how stupid are you didnt you read the bible we have to leave you up there until you die and then you come back to life in three days
what
yeah dummy you have to get a nurection
then i can give it to my dad
hey uh i dont wanna be jesus anymore dont leave me here you guys all right that does it screw you guys im going home okay im getting pissed now god
all right people scientist marsh and i have been working very hard on the problem of spontaneous combustion and we have finally come up with a solution mr marsh
the little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend it wasnt the girl that caused him to combust it was the fact that kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her you see as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas
the methane gathers here in the bowel area where it causes pressure normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart should the gas not be expelled the methane can build up and then ignite leading to disaster kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long
you mean all we have to do is fart and we wont explode
exactly
so from this day forward everyone in south park will be required to fart on a regular basis to insure that nobody else spontaneously explodes
randy randy randy randy
we love you randy
make love to me randy please
whoa dude my dads famous
come on lets go see how cartman is doing with his uh urection
wow he died
now we just gotta wait for his urection and i can give it to my dad
hey there you guys are
cartman
you guys are in big trouble now get me down from here
how come youre not dead yet cartman
you guys i mean seriously get me down
look fatass after you die and get resurrurected youll have all kinds of superpowers just like jesus
really
yeah so hurry up and die you piece of crap
when i get all my superpowers im gonna use them to smote you two assholes right off the planet dude superpowers are sweet
hi boys
hi mr mackey
have you guys been sure to pass gas regularly so you dont spontaneously combust
we know how to fart mr mackey
well let me show you just to be sure mkay hmm come on be good now
jesus christ
sick dude
i had a steak wrapped with bacon last night
dude i think you pooed a lot

squeaker
and so i declare today randy marsh day where we shall remember forever how he freed us all from the threat of spontaneous combustion gentlemen
youre the best randy
i am i am huh i never knew the depth of my scientific genius until now
its too bad cartman cant be here to enjoy this
yeah
you guys seriously somebody get me down from here
nur nunur nunur nunur nunur nunur-

no no this cant be
whoa hoho whoa oh wow oh ah im the best yeah yeah ah its just so amazing to be told that youre the best i i thought i was just a normal person like all of you but yeah well thank you for showing me otherwise yeah i kick ass yeah

yes marsh we have a new problem and i think only you can solve it
i suspect youre talking about the dramatic heat wave
yes the temperature is steadily rising every day i want you to find out why
mayor i think im a little overqualified for this my scientific mind is best used on global problems
all right all right name your price
ten thousand i have to protect my talent
done just find out whats happening
dont worry mayor ill find the cause or else or else what exactly
hey you guys seriously
what the- oh what now

its really gonna piss you off
what
this is just a dream youre still up on that cross
oh damnit
dad wheres the phone book
not now stanley without my scientific genius the town is doomed lets see now when exactly did the temperature start to go up
our topic tonight is the rising temperatures in south park lets go to the phones caller youre on the air
yeah um jesus after you got crucified how long did it take you to die and resurrect
stan
thats not the topic tonight the topic is global warming
oh
do you have an opinion on global warming
uh it sucks ass
okay thank you caller well lets go to our first guest dr alphonse mephesto thank you for coming you claim to know the cause of global warming in south park
i most certainly do the cause of global warming is randy marsh it was marshs theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer we are all doomed to die
awww crap
go get him
we want answers
youve killed us all
someones got to pay
its out of control
boy theyre really pissed
well theyre right we should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere
well lets go talk to them stick by me
hey
you killed us all
shove that nobel prize up your ass
oh my god whats going on
now we either hold in our farts and spontaneously combust o-o-or we let our farts out and kill our entire planet well i for one am not farting anymore
uuuh i- ill try to find a solution
we dont want your solutions phony
give me that yeah
damn you marsh get out of town
you fraud
mr garrison help me
i i do not know you sir
up your-
arrn
yeah take that
dude thats my dad
oh yeah sorry
the spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts meanwhile the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion as we all know the cause for all of this is randy marsh the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist we caught up with mr marsh earlier today and he had this to say
i-i dont know what to say
what an asshole i hate that guy and so do you and now on to the weather its fucking hot thanks to randy marsh son of a bitch
dude those people are pissed
i know huh
wheres your dad
hes hiding down in the basement i i dont know what to do
well you have to help him just like i have to help my dad
still more up next from the heat wave caused by randy marsh a giant glacier is melting above south park and the entire town is doomed and now these messages
having a hard time with male potency well i dont and im bob dole whats wrong with you christ im bob dole and i can get it up
are you a lawyer
yes
we want to sue randy marsh
why
he gave us skin cancer
yeah he put the hole in the ozone and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies look
what are you doing dad
stanley i think its best you live with kyle from now on his dad is better than me
no hes not he cant even get an erection
hm really
dad youve got to work people are dying dad youve got to come up with a solution
not me im not a scientist im a hack even if i found a solution those people would still all hate me
well that doesnt matter i learned something from the stations of the cross
what
see at first jesus was all like "why me" and he was all pissed off and stuff but then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else so he stopped thinking about his own misery and did what had to be done right as jesus was dying he raised his hand and said "the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"
youre right stanley youre absolutely right hey that bible sounds like kind of a good book
it aint bad you should try reading it sometime
dude that was star trek again
huh
"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few" that was wrath of khan
uh well bible wrath of khan whats the difference
all right now lets get to work
ive been telling everybody that youre my girl cause im not one to be shy you dont have to go with me if you dont want to just tell everybody im your guy you and me girl its foreversha la la la la laaaive been telling everybody that youre my girlcause im not one to be shy ive been telling everybody that youre my girlcause im not one to be shy you dont have to go with me if you dont want to justtell everybody im your guy you and me girl its foreversha la la la la laaayou and me girl forever and everyou and me girl forever and everyou and me girl forever and ever
dad dad
wow
dad what are you doin you have to get started
right right right
kyle wheres your mother
shes upstairs
well i have something to give to her dont worry kyle everythings gonna be okay between me and your mom
really great i dont have to worry about that anymore
hello-o
look there he is
get him
uh please everyone-
youre a dead man marsh
please just listen to me i think i found the answer
could i borrow one of your rocks
its all about moderation if you never fart you combust but if you always fart you deplete the ozone so we must fart only at appropriate times or when its really really funny
huh
i know you all hate me but please for your own sake fart in moderation you can keep stoning me now if you want ow
and so we salute randy marsh and his unified theory of moderation that has saved us all
see my dad is the coolest after all
well my dad is too
cartman
i forgot all about him
hes been up there for like three weeks
wow
thats amazing
hey you guys i am really pissed off now
dude youre still alive cartman
get me down from here
dude you survived all this time on the fat stored up in your body
yes and when i get down from here im gonna kick you both right in the nuts
