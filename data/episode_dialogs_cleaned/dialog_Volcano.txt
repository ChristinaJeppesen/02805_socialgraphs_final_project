scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain and kills anybody who dares climb to the top

a hook
a knife
no a piece of celery
celery
yeah and he walks with a limp because one of his legs is missing and where his leg should be theres nothing butpatrick duffy

(thanks)
the people of south park are humble and friendly but now a ticking time-bomb of hot lava waits to engulf these people and end their miserable lives with one last fleeting moment of excruciatingly painful burning agony
yeahhh
hey im on tv im on tv
mayor what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe
all we know right now is that some of our children are camping on that mountain and oh im sorry can i start over

fire in the hoooole
holy crap
damn it i think i missed
what the hell is wrong with you people
cmon lets move move
hey wait aah
is is it on okay okay people form groups and search the mountain report back here every hour you got that
mayor i might have an uhh idea
huh what
well if we can dig a very large trench we can divert the lava into a canyon and then it would bypass south park pretty much completely
and that would be good right
uh - pretty sure
well what are we waiting for okay people change of plans half of you grab shovels
these look like its tracks he must have gone this way ned prepare some hk-12 and some plasticine ill bet that suckers headed for a higher elevation the higher up it- bird the higher up it goes the better it can breathe
look up there
you guys its just me
are we sure its scuzzlebutt
does it have patrick duffy for a leg
i cant tell lets kill it
eh gotta get out of this stupid costume
kenny you take the front
no
i can do it uncle jimbo i want to bag that animal
thats the spirit kiddo lets hunt
you guys you guys i was just kidding
as some people of south park try desperately to save their mountain town others look for the missing townspeople but all must take every precaution necessary
okay people listen up as we near the top of the mountain the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great therefore i have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety mr garrison if you would please
harbingers of sorrow natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress and the volcano is no exception but what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family here we see the stevens family enjoying a may picnic but suddenly daughter hears a noise its a volcano junior seems worried but have no fear junior jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt
thats right jane duck and cover
so what will you -do when you hear a volcano erupting
thats right duck and cover
looks like you got the idea duck and cover thank you and goodbye
ok any questions
