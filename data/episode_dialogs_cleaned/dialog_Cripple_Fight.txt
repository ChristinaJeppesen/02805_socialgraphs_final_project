whats goin on
some kind of gay pride rally
lah-livin a lie
tom im standing out in front of henrys supermarket where five brave little boys are holding a rally to support gays in scouting the rally is drawing so much attention that people from all over the country are taking media notice
those boys have shown me the light i never knew the mountain scouts was a hate group
this is a wake up call to america we cannot turn our backs on gays anymore
oh god theyre actually pulling it off
the rally has also caught the attention of old scouts members like steven spielberg director of such films as always and 1941
i salute those boys and their courage i am hereby cutting all my funding to the scouts
the rally has also caught the attention of high-powered lawyer gloria allred
it is a disgrace that these homophobes are allowed to discriminate i am taking this case on personally
with this kind of support tom these boys are sure to have a victory for gays back to you
thanks chris in other news the fbi has finally caught the child molester known as mr slippyfist this sick child molester was found with disturbing graphic photos of young boys naked which we will show you now
heres one and heres another
kenny
oh my god
here look at this one sick sonofabitch heres one right here
alright boys break it up
all rise
in the case of big gay al versus mountain scouts of america due to the overwhelming show of support it is the ruling of this court that the scouts must allow big gay al and all gays into their club
alright yeah woohoo
well weve all learned an important lesson that just because somebodys gay doesnt mean theyre gonna molest children straight people do that too
yeah
and furthermore the scout elders will be put into stocks for three days so they can see how it feels to be outcast
hooray yeah yeah
we did it we did it
i did it i did it haha
today is a great day for democracy the scouts have been exposed for the vile gay bashers they are and we all it all to me and these six brave little boys five brave little boys and now here to take his official oath back in scouts is big gay al
thank you all very much but i dont want this
whats he saying
huh
look i appreciate what you kids did i really do but this isnt what i wanted im proud to be gay and im proud to be in a country where im free to express myself but freedom is a two-way street if im free to express myself then the scouts have to be free to express themselves too i know these men they are good men they are kind men they do what they think is best for kids no matter how wrong we think they might be it isnt right for us to force them to think our way its up to us to persuade and help them see the light not extort them to please dont cut the scouts funding the scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids thats why i love them i will continue to persuade them to change their mind but this is the wrong way to do it so i am hereby dropping my case and allowing the scouts their right to not allow gays into their private club
uh hooray
hooray hey
so wait did we do good
uh yeah ah i think so
eh we kick ass
come on kids lets go get some ice cream
you cant do this you homophobe
well timmy i guess we learned an important lesson too very much there is room for more than one handi-capable person in scouts
