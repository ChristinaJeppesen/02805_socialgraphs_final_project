yeah dad were just rehearsing our band
ooohhh i thought a group of vietnamese people were having their intestines pulled out through their mouths
heheheheheh heheheheheh
hes right dude we have to define our style if were ever going to make a platinum album i mean ah im a fusion guy but kennys background is more latin jazz
(what is it)
yeah and im more hip-hop and r-and-b oriented
i think out band better buy a whole bunch of music cds to listen to for inspiration
inspiration wait a minute thats it inspiration you guys dont you see
see what
our band should play christian rock
christian rock
think about it its the easiest crappiest music in the world right if we just play songs about how much we love jesus all the christians will buy our crap
thats a retarded idea cartman
it worked for creed
i dont wanna be in a stupid christian rock band
you just start that way stan then you cross over its genius
just get the hell out of here cartman youre not serious and youre a detriment to the band
oh yeah i will bet you ten bucks that if i start a christian rock band that i can get a platinum album before you guys do

gentlemen we are about to embark on the most amazing life-affirming financially windfalling experiences of our young lives
wow
we are going to start a christian rock band
awww
im out
wait walk out that door tolkien and youll regret it the rest of your life christians have a built-in audience of over one hundred and eighty million americans if each one of them buys just one of our albums at twelve dollars and ninety-five cents that would be-
two billion three hundred and thirty one million dollars
still want to leave tolkien thank you
dad can i borrow three hundred dollars
three hundred dollars what in the world for
our band cant find a stylistic direction to go in we need to go down to the mall to buy hundreds of cds to listen to so we can define our sound
sorry kyle we gave you your allowance already
ugh cant you see this is my dream music is my life
it wasnt your life yesterday
hold it pops ive got the music inside me its in my soul and i know my place is up on that stage im gonna make it to the top and i just want your blessing pops

no dude its cool kenny says you can download music for free on the internet
really
(yeah)
you got a computer
see everyone on the internet copies their music from their cds and then we can download them for free and play them on the computer
all right cool lets download some metallica and some stevie wonder
(oh you forgot to get some judas priest)
kennys right we should download some judas priest too
judas priest wow downloading music for free is awesome
what the hell is that
i dont know let me go check
freeze fbi
down on the ground down on the ground
hurry up let me see those hands
tango teamus to point bravo suspects in custody
move move move move move move all clear men get your ass going
move move move move move move move
kyle what did you do
i dont know
all right guys this is gonna be so easy all we have to do to make christian songs is take regular old songs and add jesus stuff to them see all we have to do is cross out words like "baby" and "darling" and replace them with jesus all right butters give me a beat okay nice very nice all right tolkien give me a smooth bass line
i dont know how to play bass
tolkien how many times do we have to go through this youre black you can play bass
im gettin sick of your stereotypes
be as sick as you want just give me a god-damned bass line
god-damnit
all right nice fellas nice i need you in my life jesusi cant live without you jesusand i just want to feel you deep inside me jesus
well done
um sir-
shut up you downloaded a lot of songs says here you even downloaded judas priest thats hard time you boys are lookin at you got anything to say for yourselves
we d-didnt think it was that big a deal
not a big deal you think downloading music for free is not a big deal put your coats on im gonna show you something and i dont think youre gonna like it
this is the home of lars ulrich the drummer for metallica look theres lars now sitting by his pool
whats the matter with him
this month he was hoping to have a gold-plated shark tank bar installed right next to the pool but thanks to people downloading his music for free he must now wait a few months before he can afford it
come theres more heres britney spears private jet notice anything britney used to have a gulfstream iv now shes had to sell it and get a gulfstream iii because people like you chose to download her music for free the gulfstream iii doesnt even have a remote control for its surround-sound dvd system still think downloading music for free is no big deal
we didnt realize what we were doing eh
that is the folly of man now look in this window here you see the loving family of master p next week is his sons birthday and all hes ever wanted was an island in french polynesia
so hes gonna get it right
i see an island without an owner if things keep going the way they are the child will not get his tropical paradise
were sorry well well never download music for free again
man must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before he acts selfishly or else i fear recording artists will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury
almost there you guys
ow
why the hell did you tell us to dress nice to take us out here
because tolkien we have to take pictures for our album cover the key to a hot-selling christian album is a flashy inspirational album cover
wow neato an album cover
this christian album better make as much money as you said it would tubby
im going to kill you one day tolkien
what did you say
nothing all right guys stand over there and look wholesome and cool i have a timer on this thing so i can get in the shot too
cheese
no no havent you guys ever seen an album cover youre supposed to be standing in random places looking away like you dont care
cheese

thanks for releasing them to us detective sorry for all the trouble they caused
its all right i think these boys learned their lesson
boy ill say
if you parents will just step over here you can pay their four hundred dollar release and penalty fees
four hundred dollars just for downloading some songs off the internet its not that big a deal
not a big deal huh come with me im gonna show you something and i dont think youre gonna like it
wugh dude i cant wait to just go back home and get back to band practice
(yeah)
no didnt you guys learn anything look if we make an album all thats gonna happen is that people are gonna steal our songs for free off the internet we wont make a dime
oh yeah

tom were now entering the second day of the rock band moops refusal to play and the second day of absolutely no other news to report on in a recent poll we asked people if moops refusal to play would stop them from downloading music off the internet one percent said yes two percent said no and ninety-seven percent said "who the hell is moop" back to you tom
hey are you the guys protesting free internet music downloading
hey its that lars ulrich guy
thats right metallica is behind you dudes a thousand percent

tom it appears now the musicians strike is growing as im speaking more musicians are arriving it looks like alanis morissette blink 182 britney spears and dozens of others are going to join moop in not playing music this is a veritable strikapalooza
guys we here at faith records were very moved by your performance at christfest youre one of the most talented christian rock bands weve ever heard
thank you so much christ has really blessed us with talent
heeheeheeyeah
we just have one question though we were looking over some of your lyrics uh "i want to walk hand-in-hand with jesus on a private beach for two/i want him to nibble on my ear and say im here for you" itit seems you really love christ
yes we sure do
eh no but it appears you are actually in love with christ
well what are you saying that that you dont really love christ
well uh of course i do i mean i just-
well whats the difference you love christ youre in love with christ i mean uh what the heck is this
uh wed just like to make sure the bands we sign are in it for god and not for the money
i resent that sir i have never in my life done anything just for the money if im lying may the lord strike me down right now

k-tal records presents the most inspirational christian rock band in the world faith + 1 featuring the very best in good wholesome christian music
oh lord you are my savior you know i miss you so much when you are gone

the cd is filled with instant classics who doesnt remember
the body of christ sleek swimmers body all muscled up and tonedthe body of christ o lord almighty i wish i could call it my ownyoure one time two times three times my saviorwhenever i see jesus up on that cross i cant help but think that he looks kinda hot
this album is not available in stores and limited quantities are available so order now
i cant take this much longer maybe were just not cut out to be in a band
you guys we cant give up on our dreams now as soon as this strike ends were gonna be the biggest band ever
yeah if we all give in now people might never stop downloading our music for free
im sure were gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop
certified letter for the rock band moop
thats us "dear moop this letter is to inform you that faith plus ones debut album has just sold one million copies"
what
"we cordially invite you to attend the platinum album award ceremony which will be held tomorrow morning at ten details and proof of sales enclosed ps nananana na na hahahaha ha ha" he did it cartman got a platinum album
is this for real this is for real
he beat us because all this time weve been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play
but why play if were not gonna make millions of dollars
because thats what real artists do people are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free if were real musicians then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening
besides maybe our songs would have gotten downloaded for free but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert
from now on moop isnt about money moop is about music were not striking anymore whos with us
were just about the money
yeah yeah
oh
