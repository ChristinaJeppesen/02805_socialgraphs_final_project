All you gotta do is call the police and say that your parents both molestered you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What\'s that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I don\'t know, but it works. When I wanted to get rid of my mom\'s last boyfriend, I just called the police, and said he was molestering me, and I haven\'t seen him for three months.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[awed]\'\' Wow! Three months without parents!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Wow, that is awesome!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But what do the police do to them?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Who cares? My parents deserve whatever they get. They\'re liars and cheats.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You have to make it convincing, though, when you call the police.

"Old Time Rock \'N\' Roll" plays. Kyle slides into view in his hat and underwear, facing away from the camera. He looks left and his sunglasses are shown. As the first words are sung, Kyle faces the camera and lip-syncs to them. With Chinpokomon around them, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman jump gleefully up and down on the sofa. In the kitchen Ike sticks a fork into the toaster. Kyle dances some more.Next scene is the Raging Pussies concert outside and inside a stadium. The four boys are in the audience, and Kyle is still in underwear. Next scene shows kids from all over descend on Kyle\'s house for a party at night.

Then Principal Victoria is taken away, and then Mr. Mackey, as Butters accuses him of something to the case worker. Four panes appear, with a child in each one (Clyde, Francis, Red, and Tolkien) calling the police. At the local bar police swarm in and the patrons scatter. Final shot: All the parents are gathered at the gates of Canyon City Maximum Security Prison}}\n{{ScriptDialog|TV Announcer|The following hot presentation is for mature audiences only.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[slides up in front of the others]\'\' You guys! Come out here! \'\'[walks out the door. The other two follow, leaving Ike alone on the sofa.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Downtown South Park. The sky is a deep blue and the streets are clear of snow.

It\'s probably the only town for a hundred miles. \'\'[they pass the sign.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Smiley Town, a beat-up gas station. The car rolls up and the man and woman get out.
