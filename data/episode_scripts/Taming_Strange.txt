Mr. Mackey is present, showing the class a new computer system he\'s had installed at school}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Students, I would like to introduce you all to the future. \'\'[holds a laptop with an IntelliLink logo on it]\'\' M\'kay. Starting today, our school will be operating entirely on IntelliLink. \'\'[presses a key that brings up the splash screen]\'\' Now whenever you need to see the school nurse, or talk to me, your counselor, you can simply sign up using this simple, integrated portal. \'\'[presses the space bar]\'\' M\'kay... \'\'[presses it again. Presses is twice more, and the main menu pops up]\'\' You can use a computer or any of the IntelliLink panels which are located throughout the school. \'\'[one such panel is shown next to the window]\'\' Lat\'s say you\'re in the cafeteria, m\'kay. You start cougin\' up blood and need to see the nurse. You just click on "school clinic"\'\'[presses a button, and the school clinic menu pops up.]\'\' Mkay, see nurse. \'\'[selects it and a box appears on the right side with fields for teachers, student, note, and some checkboxes.]\'\'M\'kay. Respiration problems. \'\'[presses a button, and "All Night Long" plays]\'\' Uh, okay, I must have I must have been in the wrong menu, uhkay. As you can see, you can control the sound system as well. Okay. \'\'[presses a key, and the song is cut off]\'\' It\'s all integrated and smartlinked, and this is a great idea, m\'kay. Let\'s look at the message board. \'\'[press, and gets to the main menu]\'\' Mesage... board. \'\'[moves the cursor to the message board icon and loads the board]\'\' Here you can easily write messages to each other or to the faculty, m\'kay? For instance, \'\'[sees the first thread title that loads]\'\' here we go. Here\'s a message from Kyle\'s little brother, Ike Broflovski. \'\'[loads the message]\'\' Okay, little Ike says "My brother is a homo"\'\'[Cartman cackles and Kyle is startled]\'\' Ike made a little drawing of his brother too. \'\'[loads the drawing]\'\' Drew a nice picture with a... nice bird hangin\' off Kyle\'s forehead, m\'kay, that\'s nice. \'\'[Cartman cackles again, and Kyle looks annoyed]\'\' It\'s a nice... crane, a nice whoopin\' crane comin\' off Kyle\'s head there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s not a crane, it\'s a dick and balls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Heheh, yeah. \'\'[chuckles to himself.

He\'s not a baby anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I know, but he posted a message of me with a schlong on my head.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|It\'s natural, bubbe. Part of getting older is finding ways to assert your independence. You know. Why don\'t you go and try to talk to him - you can win him over again. \'\'[Kyle thinks it over and walks out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ike\'s room, moments later. Kyle opens the door and enters}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey Ike, how\'s it going?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|\'\'[looks over his left shoulder]\'\' Get out of my room, Kyle! I\'m on my computer! \'\'[turns back to his computer]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I just wanted to see if maybe you want to do fingerpaints with me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|Do I look like I wanna do fuckin\' fingerpaints?! \'\'[looks over his shoulder again]\'\' Look at the fuckin\' zits on my face!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ike, I just want us to be friends again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|Then stop harassing me, bro!

She\'s a dike. You can tell.

You gonna fuckin\' narc and tell Mom?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, I just don\'t think it\'s healthy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|That\'s \'cause you don\'t understand shit! \'\'[stands on the sofa]\'\' I knew this was a bad idea! \'\'[leaves the sofa and walks away]\'\' I\'m gonna watch Yo Gabba Gabba in my roomsy!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Mackey\'s office, a few days later.

Okay, uh sume, uh students make appoint-alala here we go. Make, make appointment. \'\'[presses a key and the lights go out. He looks around]\'\' Uhkay, here we go. Uhkay, what do you need counseling with?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s my little brother. He\'s really changing and I feel like-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Okay, I\'ll click on family issues.

Okay, we got it. \'\'[smiles]\'\' Okay now, Kyle, you had some concerns about your little brother?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[takes a moment to gather them]\'\' He\'s just... changing a lot. He walks around angry, telling me I\'m stupid and, and all he talks about is sex.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well it sounds like he\'s hittin\' puberty.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, he just seems so young.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well, your brother is Canadian. Perhaps Canadian puberty is a little different. Why don\'t you educate yourself about Canadian puberty and it could be somethin\' yeeyou and your brother can actually do together. M\'kay? \'\'[plop]\'\' You know, this is the first time I\'ve been able to do counseling aaand go to the bathroom at the same time. IntelliLink is amazing.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A live program. The Canadian Board of Health Presents, "What Are These Changes?" A Guide To Puberty In Canada}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Hello young people, and welcome to the most fascinating time of your life. You have braved the trials of childhood, and now you are reaching Canadian puberty. By now, you\'ve probably noticed some changes in your body. For instance, when you fart your dick gets hard. \'\'[a long pause]\'\' Other physical changes are happening to your body as well. If you\'re a boy you may notice that your testicles ache, or if you\'re a girl, you may notice a tingling sensation in your strange.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|This is stupid, bro! I already know all this!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Let\'s just give it a chance, Ike.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Going through Canadian puberty, you may notice that your voice is starting to change as well. You\'re saying things like "hey boddy" and "hey guy" because now that you\'re older you\'re discovering that someone who was once your buddy is now your guy, and someone who you used to call "guy" is quickly becoming your friend. \'\'[A shot of Kyle and Ike looking at each other]\'\' But now let\'s discuss how a man and a woman make love. \'\'[an animated stick-figure cartoon follows]\'\' First, a man and a woman fall in love. Then the man farts on the woman\'s strange, \'\'[That is shown, with audio]\'\' filling the woman\'s strange with air so that the woman can queef on the man\'s face. \'\'[shown, with audio]\'\' And, a baby is born. \'\'[pop]\'\' The entire process can take up to six months a- \'\'[turns to his right to listen...]\'\' It\'s what? ...

I\'m gonna get to the bottom of this! \'\'[pounds on the desk and leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The street, near his residence, day. The host marches home}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Make me look like an idiot, will you?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|At home. The double doors open and the host comes in. His wife is sitting on the sofa sipping tea}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Ey! You told me you queefed on my face because because that\'s how babies are born!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wife|I was being sarcastic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Being sarcastic?! I just told a million Canadian teenages that\'s how it\'s done!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wife|I was angry because you never listen to me. Because I wanted you to go with me to therapy and you never go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Fine! You want me to go with you to therapy?! Fine!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The host goes to a therapy session with his wife.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minister|Totally embarrassing and degrading!
