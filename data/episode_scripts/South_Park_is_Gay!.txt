Well, we black people just always tried to stay out in front of them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Slave|\'\'[straightens up]\'\' How did you do that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, like with our slang. Black people always used to say, "I\'m in the house" instead of "I\'m here." But then white people all started to say "in the house" so we switched it to "in the hizzouse." Hizzouse became hizzizzouse, and then white folk started saying \'\'that\'\', and we had to change it to hizzie, then "in the hizzle" which we had to change to "hizzle fo shizzle," and now, because white people say "hizzle fo shizzle," we have to say "flippity floppity floop."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[slumps forward]\'\' We don\'t have \'\'time\'\' for all that, Chef!
