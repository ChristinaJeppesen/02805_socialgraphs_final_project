I\'ve never gotten a package this big! I\'ve always wanted to have a huge package.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters tugs at the panel he loosened. The panel swings down and Butters flies off.

You\'re the best friend a guy could have.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes. You can trust AWESOM-O. In fact, you should tell AWESOM-O all your most personal secrets. AWESOM-O will not make fun of you or tell your secrets to other people and stuff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey yeah! Well, I can tell you anything, huh? \'\'[strokes his chin]\'\' Well lessee... Well, for one, I have what\'s called a hesitated colon, which means I sometimes can\'t control my sphincter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[snickers]\'\' Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, nobody knows it, but sometimes I poop my pants, so I have to wear a diaper to school. \'\'[Cartman begins to chuckle]\'\' You okay, AWESOM-O?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes. AWESOM-O is fine. Please go on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, I have to take medicine for it every day. It\'s a little suppository I have to... put up my rectum.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[laughs]\'\' That, that\'s very interesting. Tell AWESOM-O more secrets.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hm, okay. Let\'s see \'\'[strokes his chin]\'\' Oh, my parents don\'t know, but sometimes I get picked on by this one kid at school; his name is Eric Cartman, and he always tries to play jokes on me and stuff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah. [[Casa Bonita|One time he made me think a meteor had hit the earth, and convinced me to stay down in a bomb shelter for three days]].}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Heh. Wow, that sucks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah. And then this [[Jared Has Aides|other time, he pretended to be me on the phone to my dad and called him a pussy, so my dad came home and beat me]].}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wow. Sounds like this Cartman kid is pretty smart.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|No, he\'s not smart! He\'s just an asshole.

I have a surprise for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, and he\'s never gonna get me again! \'Cause what Cartman doesn\'t know is that I know one of \'\'his\'\' secrets!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|When Cartman is playing all alone in his backyard, he likes to dress up like Britney Spears and pretend he\'s her!

And I videotaped him doing it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Nuh uh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I\'ve got the whole thing on tape! Even him making out with the Justin Timberlake cutout!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No way.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah!

Oh, I dunno. It\'s around here somewhere. Hey! So what do you wanna do now, AWESOM-O?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh, Butters, maybe you should give AWESOM-O the videotape?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|How come?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, because... AWESOM-O can, like, back it up for you, and make copies and stuff. I am AWESOM-O.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, that\'s all right, AWESOM-O. Come on! I have a lot of things to teach you. \'\'[leaves the room]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[moments later, still on the bed]\'\' Oh, son of a bitch!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Montage.

Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I would like to see what he looks like so I can beat him up for you. May I see the video?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[turns around carrying a box of suppositories]\'\' Awww, you don\'t need to do that, AWESOM-O.

He turns to his left and places a hand on AWESOM-O.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Morning. A cock crows. Butters wakes up, but AWESOM-O isn\'t in bed with him. He looks around and sees his room is a mess. His drawers are out of the dressers and his clothes are strewn all over the place. One of his clothing rods has been knocked down and his closet doors are open. AWESOM-O is shown at Butters\' desk looking through more stuff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Where is it? Where is it?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|AWESOM-O?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|AWESOM-O, what the Sam Heck are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Um, ah AWESOM-O is reorganizing your stuff for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Aw Jeez, Jeez Louise!

Ah, I see you met my robot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh yeah, Butters, he\'s real cool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey he sure is! We do everything together. Why last night we even had a slumber party. \'\'[Stan, Kyle, and Kenny quickly look to Cartman]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Weak.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|He can do anything I command him to.

The boys are getting along so well, that we were thinking of inviting Eric to go along.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh, well, I\'m not sure. Actually, Eric is still supposed to be grounded for trying to exterminate the Jews two weeks ago.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|\'\'[Stephen takes a sip]\'\' Excuse me, I didn\'t catch that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh, but I suppose it would be good for him.

We, we have no data suggesting the Japanese have developed a robot with offensive capability.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|You\'re paid to think, Mr. Scientist! National security is our jub. \'\'[the scientist sits back down.]\'\' Gentlemen, we\'re going to Los Angeles! \'\'[zoom in]\'\' I want that robot!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Catamount Pictures lobby. Butters places a call.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, me and my robot are still over at the movie studio, Aunt Nellie. We\'re makin\' all sorts of money for the poor.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boardroom. Cartman is pitching more movie ideas.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped on an island and falls in love with a coconut.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Great, AWESOM-O, great. Uh guys, take a break. I need a minute alone with AWESOM-O.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The other men rise and leave the room, making plans for lunch on the way out. The producer approaches Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|You are an incredible robot, AWESOM-O. I was just wondering... are you by chance a... pleasure model?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Well, have you been programmed to... satisfy... urges of humans?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|AWESOM-O does not understand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Let me show you what I mean. \'\'[removes his tie]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Catamount Pictures lobby.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well yeah, we\'re havin\' a great time, Aunt Nellie. These movie studio guys are real nice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[from the boardroom]\'\' Lame!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, we\'re makin\' a bunch more money. I can\'t believe it either.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boardroom doors burst open and AWESOM-O runs out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Not cool! Totally lame! \'\'[runs to his left. Butters looks over his shoulder]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|AWESOM-O? Well, I gotta go, Aunt Nellie. Ah, AWESOM-O is havin\' some kind of malfunction. \'\'[hangs up and goes after AWESOM-O.]\'\' AWESOM-O? Hey, where\'d ya go?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters looks left, then right, then goes to the right, exiting the scene. Moments later the producer shows up at the doorway with his pants down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Waaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A cattle prod appears and shocks him until he falls over. A dolly then appears and two soldiers quickly put Cartman on it and haul him off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier|Let\'s go! Move, move!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[appears around the corner]\'\' AWESOM-O? \'\'[notices the soldiers]\'\' Hey, what are you doin\' with him?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The soldiers exit some side doors and toss him into the back of a waiting van. Butters exits the side door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That\'s my robot! \'\'[the soldiers get into the van and drive off]\'\' AWESOM-OOOOOOOO!!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A military base near Los Angeles. In a warehouse, AWESOM-O, shackled onto a platform, is raised from a horizontal position to vertical. Two soldiers approach on either side of Cartman and tighten the locks on him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|Are those arm and leg locks secure?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier|Secure, sir!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|Good. I don\'t want that robot mobile until I know what it\'s capable of. All right, power it on. \'\'[the scientist turns a drill on and approaches AWESOM-O]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Whoa, whoa, wha- whoa, whoa!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|\'\'[steps back surprised]\'\' What the hell?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|What\'s going on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|\'\'[in disbelief]\'\' It... powered itself back on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|\'\'[whispers to a soldier to his left]\'\' Stand by. Be ready to destroy it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The soldier cocks his semiautomatic and aims at Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Where the hell am I?! Hey, why can\'t I move?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Are your systems stable? Run a systems check on your CPU.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|The fuck are you talkin\' about, dude?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Ah, I\'m sorry, robot, \'\'[in a low voice, almost a whisper]\'\' they want me to reprogram you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m not a robot, dumbass! I\'m alive!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|What did you say?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I said I\'m a real person, asswipe!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|\'\'[stunned]\'\' ...Oh my God. \'\'[turns around and approaches the military]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|What\'s happening?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|The robot... It thinks it\'s alive. It\'s developed consciousness.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|What? How can that be?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Must be a malfunction of its exographical IMS or the... interlaced BV system.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|Speak in a language we can understand, Mr. Scientist!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Your robot doesn\'t know it\'s a robot!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Goddamnit, get me down from here! \'\'[the military approaches him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|Who made you, robot?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[enunciating]\'\' I\'m not a robot, I\'m a human!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|White official|\'\'[the military turns around]\'\' Jesus, the scientist was right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|But, who would have programmed it to think it was human? The movie studio?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Look, retards! My name is Eric Cartman! I live with my mom in South Park, Colorado!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|\'\'[faces Cartman]\'\' Dear Christ, they gave it memories, too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Sure, why not? Program the memories of some eight-year-old boy who doesn\'t exist, and make the robot think he\'s real! Makes for a lot better movies! I\'m not reprogramming a robot that\'s developed consciousness!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|Do I have to remind you of your position?! Don\'t forget you have a duty to your country, \'\'[draws out the next few syllables]\'\' Mr. Scientist!! I want that robot\'s memories and consciousness E-RASED, so we can take it back to Washington! GOT IT?! \'\'[the military leaves him to his work.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Damn you all to hell!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Los Angeles. Butters walks down a sidewalk alone with his head down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|<poem>\'\'[voiceover, sadly]\'\'\n<i>Hey there, did you know I had a robot friend?\nWe used to laugh and play, but someone took him away.\nHe was my ten gigahertz old pal.\nMy robot friend.</i>\n</poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[realizing something]\'\' Hey, wait a minute. \'\'[sees the van that took AWESOM-O away]\'\' Why, that\'s the van that- \'\'[tuns towards it]\'\' Oh my God!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The military base, warehouse. The scientist has positioned AWESOM-O so his head can be drilled into, and a huge drill bit begins to descend towards him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[fidgets frantically]\'\' Goddamnit, stop! I\'m real! I\'m real!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier|It\'ll all be over soon, robot!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The scientist scratches his head, then decides to take action. He takes out a vice wrench and smacks the soldier with it, knocking him out. He turns off the drill, tosses the wrench aside and goes to AWESOM-O.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|Hang on! I\'m getting you out of here, robot!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aw, it\'s about freaking time, jackass!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The General and his men return, Cartman gets off the platform.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|What the hell are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|\'\'[turns around]\'\' Well I- I\'m saving a conscious being!

Now I can show you stupid assholes who I really am! \'\'[raises his helmet enough to show his eyes]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[enters]\'\' AWESOM-O!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The helmet quickly goes down and Cartman becomes a robot again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I am the AWESOM-O 4000.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The soldier fires one shot into the scientist, and the scientist goes down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|No! \'\'[runs up to Cartman]\'\' No, please! \'\'[hugs him]\'\' Don\'t kill him! He\'s my best friend! He\'s my best friend in the whole world!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters begins to sob. The military is amazed by this display of affection from a boy towards his robot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist|\'\'[still alive, looks up]\'\' There. You see? You want to tell me \'\'this\'\' isn\'t humanity? Who\'s to judge what makes something human anyway?! \'\'[pulls out his stomach]\'\' Does this make me human?! \'\'[pulls out his lung]\'\' Or this?! \'\'[pulls out his intestines]\'\' Or these?! \'\'[falls over dead]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|\'\'[approaches AWESOM-O]\'\' Perhaps... there is consciousness in this robot. Maybe we as a society need to realize that artificial intelligence... is intelligence all the same, and we can learn from the robots.

The military is taken aback at what they see..}}\n{{ScriptScene|A portable screen is put up inside a room and the videotape of Cartman acting strange in his backyard is being shown.
