My blood sugar spikes and I get all anxious, and then I cra-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Eric, you just can\'t keep being mean to me and blaming it on your blood sugar.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But ih, but it\'s true, Heidi! It\'s all my mom\'s fault. She feeds me all this crap, and my body doesn\'t know how to process it. Mom! Mom!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Yes, hon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You fucked up my life, Mom! Fuck you! How could you feed me like that, you bitch?! Get outta here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Eric, if blood sugar is really the problem, then you need to change how you eat, right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Right. Like, whattaya whattaya mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Eric, every time I\'ve talked to you about maybe being a vegan with me, you just tell me vegans are pussies. But then you try and blame food and your mom for being-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It is the food, and it is my mom, Heidi! It is! I wanna be vegan with you! I need your help to show me how. Please, Heidi. I need you right now, more than ever. I wand to do this. Please!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|You really mean it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, Heidi! That\'s how much I love you!

She\'s a controlling, manipulative whore!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s enough, Cartman! I am so sick of hearing you call Heidi horrible things!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s because you don\'t understand how much it sucks to be in a relationship!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[approaching]\'\' Hey babe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh hey babe, what\'s going on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|What are you up to?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[uninterested]\'\' Nothin\', just tellin\' the guys how awesome it is to be vegan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[happy]\'\' That\'s great.

What the hell is going on?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, it\'s not our problem.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It is our problem. This is affecting us! Our whole school. There\'s got to be a reason she sticks by him.}}\n{{ScriptScene|After school. The bell rings and kids pour out of the building.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[spots her and runs up]\'\' Oh Heidi? Heidi, you got a sec?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Oh. Hey Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey. Uh, listen, uh... I-I know you and Cartman have an anniversary coming up and, I was just wondering, you know, um. How do you think he\'s doing? Aaas a boyfriend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Well, whattaya mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, you know, like, some of us are thinking that, uh, maybe he\'s not super-qualified to be with you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Oh, God, not you too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Just, like, what are the things about Cartman that you find remotely redeeming?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Look, don\'t you think I get it enough from my girlfriends? "He sucks, Heidi. What\'s wrong with you? Why can\'t you admit he\'s a loser? How could anyone ever go with him?" I was just following my heart. Isn\'t that what you\'re supposed to do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You don\'t have to get defensive. I just-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[gets in his face]\'\' Who\'s being defensive?! He\'s great! We\'re doing great! I didn\'t make a bad decision! I don\'t need you to stand there and say "I told you so!" \'\'[turns around and walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I didn\'t say "I... \'\'[she whips around again]\'\' told you-"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[points at him]\'\' You know, you don\'t know what Eric\'s like when we\'re alone, okay? He\'s actually really good to me. \'\'[turns around and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wooow.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Heidi\'s house, day. Cartman is at the front door knocking insistently. Heidi walks to it and opens it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Heidi! \'\'[walks in with a bag of food]\'\' Oh my God, you\'re not gonna believe this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You were so right \'\'[Heidi closes the door]\'\' when you said there were vegan options for everything. \'\'[puts the food on the table]\'\' Remember how you told me about Beyond Meat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Yeah, the vegan meat that\'s made with all vegetables and plants.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, I tried it and you were right. You can\'t even tell the difference between that and real meat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Really? That\'s great, babe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So now I\'ve been trying all kinds of vegan foods. You gotta try this. It\'s called Beyond KFC.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Oh wow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s all plant based, soy protein, and just- y-you gotta taste it. Just try it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[Heidi tries a breaded breast]\'\' It tasted just like KFC.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I know, right?! Isn\'t that crazy?! \'\'[Cartman eats another breaded breast]\'\' Like, like seriously, how can you even tell that this was vegan? Try the, try the Beyond Mashed Potatoes and Gravy too. \'\'[hands her the mashed potatoes and gravy]\'\' They say you can even drink the Beyond Gravy by itself as like a protein boost. \'\'[eats some more of his breast while she eats the mashed potatoes and gravy]\'\' I don\'t know about you, but I could eat this every day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Yeah, it\'s really good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[evilly narrowing his eyes to slits]\'\' Delicious.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. The bell rings as students go to their lockers to switch out books. As Stan, Kenny, and Butters walk down the hallway. Kyle catches up to them. Tolkien joins them as well.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Guys, listen: I think I know why Heidi won\'t admit Cartman\'s a horrible boyfriend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, are you still on this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah! It\'s important.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Maybe she\'s telling the truth, Kyle. Maybe Eric really does love and support her in ways that we don\'t see.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[running up to them]\'\' You guys! You guys! Have you seen Heidi? \'\'[walks on past them]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well uh, we\'ve been trying some different foods lately and uh, \'\'[turns around]\'\' Heidi\'s put on some pounds, you guys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Heidi\'s getting fat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, Tolkien. Don\'t start rippin\' on me for havin\' a fat girlfriend, alright? Just try and be cool about it. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[walks up behind him]\'\' Hey babe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, hey hey hey, Heidi. What\'s goin\' on? \'\'[a surprised look flashes on his face]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|I-ah, I\'m not feeling the best again. \'\'[Cartman smiles again]\'\' I might see if my mom can come pick me up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Pick you up? That could be tough. \'\'[a shot at the boys, who just look blankly at him and Heidi. Kyle, though, is not amused]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|I, I know, but I just feel bloated. I think there might have been something bad in that Beyond Arby\'s.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, well, cool, babe. Maybe you should uh, just waddle on down to the nurse\'s office. \'\'[the surprised look flashes on his face again, then disappears]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Can you come with?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh sure. \'\'[they turn around and walk away, but Cartman looks over his shoulder and points at Heidi\'s bloated figure]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We have to help that girl. Can\'t you see what\'s happening?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle, it\'s none of our business.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You\'re wrong. In a way... I think we\'re all going out with Cartman right now.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Oval Office, day. The President is on the phone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|Uh huh. Yeah, I understand that, faggot. And you should understand how my balls are gonna taste when your country starts needing money. I don\'t give two shits about a treaty. You\'re a Polish midget. \'\'[A knock is heard at the doors]\'\' Come in. \'\'[three advisers come in - Mike Pence, Paul Ryan, and Mitch McConnell - and Garrison gets back on the phone]\'\' Uh huh. Hang, uh hang on. I\'m gonna call you back. Yeah, go fuck yourself, retard. \'\'[hangs up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch McConnell|Mr. President, we have a problem. People are pretty upset.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|Hoh, don\'t tell me people are still made about that n*gger thing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mike Pence|It\'s pronounced Niger, Mr. President. And it\'s a country in Africa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|Oh, aren\'t we fancy. Okay, I don\'t want a bunch of \'\'[finger quotes]\'\' Nigers in Africa aiding terrorists.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Paul Ryan|Mr. President, you need to be a little more careful. There\'s an investigation. A worker with ties to Russia was found raped and executed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|Raped and executed? Oh, you mean fucked to death? Oh yeah, that was me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|McConnell|Mr. President, people are starting to question your oath to the office.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|My oath to the office was that I would fuck everyone to death, remember?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Memberberries|Ooo, I \'member. Me too, I \'member. I \'member that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|\'\'[to the berries]\'\' You guys be quiet, \'\'[to his advisers]\'\' and you guys just get out there and put a positive spin on this whole thing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|McConnell|How are we supposed to put a positive spin on it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|It\'s getting pretty hard to keep defending you. Maybe it\'s time we put our foot down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|Oooo. \'\'[whips out a remote control and presses a button on it, making the doors close and lock automatically. The advisers turn to see this]\'\' Hope you brought some condoms.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school gym, day. Most of the girls are in vollyball practice, but six of them are in the bleachers. The side gym doors open and Kyle walks in. The girls stop practice only when he gets onto the court. He holds his hands up. The girls are not happy to see him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hello. I know things have been difficult between us lately. I know you think all boys are sort of pigs, but just know that a lot of us boys think girls are amazing and smart and beautiful. \'\'[dead air]\'\' Not, not like hot-beautiful, I mean like inside-beautiful. I, I\'m not saying you\'re hot. You\'re not, you\'re not hot. I\'m not saying you\'re ugly. It doesn\'t matter- you\'re all hot on the inside. If we could all just see inside you, it would be hot. \'\'[realizes he\'s out on a limb]\'\' Oh, shit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|What do you want, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s Heidi Turner. You guys shouldn\'t criticize her so much for going with Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Annie|Why not? Eric Cartman\'s a horrible person.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I know! I, I know that, okay? Trust me, I hate Cartman as much as any of you, but just, give her some space, you know? You can\'t keep on saying "We told you so", because if you make her feel dumb, she just doubles down and tries to prove herself that it wasn\'t dumb.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Why do you care? Do you like Heidi?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Theresa|Oh my God, he so likes Heidi.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lola|Obvi.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No I don\'t! ... Do I?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school hallway, day. Kyle is sitting on some steps surprised at his fondness for Heidi showingn through.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[walks up to him]\'\' Hey, Kyle. Hey, I was thinkin\' about what you said. How we should all help Heidi break up with Eric? You\'re right, it\'s our moral obligation.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, no, we\'re not getting involved with that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, we\'re not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[stands up]\'\'Yeah, no, yeah, I uh dya, I think we need to stay out of it. \'\'[walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters:\tOh. Okay then.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s locker, moments later. Cartman is switching out books when Kyle walks up to him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman, can we talk?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sure, Kyle. What\'s up? \'\'[brings out a harness and puts it on]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I just, I hope that maybe you can realize what you have with Heidi and, and just try to be good to her, okay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kyle, let me tell you something about relationships. There\'s always two sides, okay? You compromise, she compromises. Sometimes you criticize each other, but it\'s all part of trying to make each other better. \'\'[picks up a big bass drum and straps it onto the harness, then picks up some drumsticks]\'\' Someday, maybe you\'ll have a girlfriend and you\'ll understand. Oh, here she comes. \'\'[at the far end of the hallway, Heidi rounds the corner and walks towards them, and Cartman starts beating the drum]\'\' BOOM baba BOOM baba. Clear the hallway everyone, Heidi\'s comin\' through.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[walks up to Cartman]\'\' Wha, what are you doing, Eric?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I was just practicing marching bass drum for my buddy Kyle. It\'s his favorite.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Oh, okay. Um, are we still on for lunch?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You betcha, can\'t wait.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Okay, see ya. \'\'[walks away, vaguely upset]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[resumes the drum beat]\'\' BOOM baba BOOM baba BOOM!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Breaking news.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchor Bill Keegan|Some concern over the President\'s competency again today. It was during a Middle East peace conference when the President referred to the people of Saudi Arabia as a bunch of "dirty sand Nigers". Though the comments seem divisive, Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, says he\'s sticking by his President 100%. \'\'[next shot is of Paul Ryan with a black eye stained with semen]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Speaker Ryan, it\'s the anniversary of the President being elected. How do you think he\'s doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Well whattaya mean? He\'s great. We\'re doing great. A lot of people judge him and just see the negative. People don\'t know how great the President can be behind closed doors. They don\'t get to see all his good qualities.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Uh huh. And is that semen on your black eye?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Oh. No, I-uh I tripped on a doorknob and uh that\'s just, that\'s doorknob cum.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school gym, day. Heidi is all alone there, sitting on the bottom bleacher lost in thought. Kyle sees her from one end of the court. He sighs quietly and walks up to her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You doin\' okay, Heidi?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|I keep thinking Eric\'s going to change.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[sits down next to her and sighs]\'\' Heidi, people like Cartman, they always make things someone else\'s fault. We all wrongly see ourselves as the victims sometimes, but Cartman sees himself as the victim all the time. He\'ll always find someone to blame for his shortcomings, and because of that, he\'s never gonna change.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Before we started going out I was in a really bad place. I felt... pushed away by society. Then this guy came along who told me all the things I wanted to hear, and I just went with it. Does that make me a bad person? \'\'[Rihanna\'s "Unfaithful" begins to play]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, Heidi. Good people make bad decisions every day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|I\'ve been defending him for so long. I don\'t know how I\'m gonna face people if I finally give up. \'\'[next scene is Heidi looking through her scrapbook at the memories she and Cartman created together. His discomfort begins to show in the fourth picture. She closes the book, and her location is shown - she\'s in bed. Next scene shows her at her locker putting books away when she notices someone looking at her. It\'s Kyle, looking at her from his locker. He then puts his books into his locker. Next scene shows Heidi and Cartman at the park bench, where she leaves him and he grabs onto her leg to delay her departure. Next scene has Kyle receiving a letter from Heidi. He reads it and smiles.
