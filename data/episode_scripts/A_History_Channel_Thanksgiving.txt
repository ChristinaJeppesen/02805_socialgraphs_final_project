\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day, Mr. Garrison\'s class. The bell rings. Mr. Garrison goes to the front of the class.

Was Thanksgiving about turkey and peace? Or was it the beginning of the genocide of an entire race?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[innocently]\'\' Thanksgiving is about murder?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle\'s room, afternoon. The four boys are there. Stan and Kyle are reading books at Kyle\'s desk, Kenny is reading a couple of books on the floor, and Cartman is... on his back on Kyle\'s bed eating Cheesy Poofs}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|This is bullcrap! A guest speaker comes to our class and assigns us a report on Thanksgiving?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, it is kinda true, you know? Thanksgiving is fun and all, but the Native Americans got pretty screwed over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, and now my video game time is getting screwed over by them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[looks over his shoulder angrily]\'\' Hey, fatass! Instead of laying in bed eating, why don\'t you come and help?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Jesus Kyle, you are really being crampy today.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We all have to do this report together, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys, we are wasting time.

Who needs to read a bunch of stupid books when we\'ve got History Channel?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Narrator|\'\'[more re-enactments]\'\' We know the first Thanksgiving was in the fall of 1621, but new evidence suggests that the first exchanging of food between the Pilgrims and Native Americans may have been visited by aliens! \'\'[dramatic flashes of darkness as the alien is shown up close, then a picture of a fetus, and then...]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Duncan Everton|\'\'[Professor of History, Oakmont H.S.]\'\' In every journal entry we researched from those early Pilgrims, not one entry mentioned anything about aliens not being there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Narrator|And what about the food? \'\'[a juicy baked turkey is shown, then the previous image is shown without the alien]\'\' Does the appearance of stuffing at the first Thanksgiving suggest a kind of alien technology? \'\'[the alien reappears in the scene, but with two other aliens]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh-huh??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What? This isn\'t history.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, it \'\'is\'\' called History Channel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charles Biggens|\'\'[Culinary Associates of America]\'\' And if we look in all the journals and aall the history books, there is no reference to stuffing before 1621.

Is it mere coincidence that Cape Cod, when viewed from space, looks like an alien life form? \'\'[an alien with an erect penis is drawn over the aerial image]\'\' What exactly did the Pilgrims experience? \'\'[colored lights move around over the ocean\'s horizon as Pilgrims gather by the beach]\'\' How exactly did those beings from another world shape the dinner we celebrate every November? \'\'[a tiny UFO hovers near a turkey]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kyle, why are you being so grumpy? Are you on your period again?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re not basing research for our report on this crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, let\'s take a vote: Who thinks the possibility of ancient aliens at Thanksgiving makes for an interesting history report? \'\'[he and Kenny raise their hands, then Stan raises his]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[at Stan]\'\' Dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, and who wants to take a little Pamprin so their menstrual cramps stop bringing everyone down?

I was thinking maybe that\'s why Kyle\'s been so grouchy lately, \'cause he\'s goin\' through menopause.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, shut your fuckin\' mouth!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|See what I mean, you guys? \'\'[a black car with tinted windows pulls up at a corner within sight of the boys and the passenger window comes down and the agents inside look at the boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 1|\'\'[brunet]\'\' Is that them?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 2|\'\'[blond]\'\' That\'s them.}}\n{{ScriptScene|An interrogation room, somewhere.

It can\'t be coincidence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We saw it on your channel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|THC President|What exactly did you seez?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That... stuffing was never heard of before 1621, so it might be alien technology?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|THC President|My God. Would you be willing to say that on camera for an interview?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, living room. He\'s watching a Jonas Brothers video}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steven|Alright, Butters, that\'s enough MTV for one day. You need to watch something that stimulates your brain.

And it might have been... alien technology?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Narrator|And while the number of people who accept the alien theory continues to grow, some experts have stepped forward with a wildly different view altogether. Could it be that Pilgrims were actually aliens themselves?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle Broflovski|\'\'[Ph. D., Professor of Thanksgiving - DeVry Institute]\'\' Of course you can\'t prove there were no aliens at the first Thanksgiving! Just like you can\'t "prove" that... the Pilgrims themselves weren\'t alien! Can you prove that?! Here: draw that Thanksgiving turkey symbol with your hand!

OooOoOoOooOOO! \'\'[moves his hands around]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Narrator|\'\'[a scene of alien families sharing Thanksgiving on Earth]\'\' Could it be that the Pilgrims we\'ve read about all these years actually came from another planet?
