Do you know how we can get in touch with him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You thought it sucked? Sir, apparently, you don\'t understand what Mel Gibson was trying to do! He was trying to express, through cinema, the horror and filthiness of the common Jew.

We each make it our responsibility to convert one more person!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guests|Heheh, great! Yeah!

And this friend belongs to a certain, Chosen People of Israel. And it... so happens that these chosen people killed your Lord.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father Maxi|Ah! You mean he\'s a Jew!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Right. But he can\'t live with the guilt anymore. Because, even if Jesus \'\'wasn\'t\'\' really the Son of God, he was still a nice guy.

I mean, my... friend can\'t sleep at night.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father Maxi|Yes, \'\'The Passion\'\' is very powerful. The truth is, there\'s not a whole lot in the Bible about the Crucifixion. The Passion was actually done as a performance piece back in the Middle Ages to incite people against the Jews.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But how can the Jews make it better??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father Maxi|Well, if you really care about your friend\'s soul, then perhaps show him the way of Jesus.

A tour bus heads east, with Stan and Kenny riding inside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty... seven dollars getting our money back from Mel Gibson. \'\'[net loss, sixty-nine dollars]\'\' But I think it\'s the principle of the thing that matters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah. I agree.) \'\'[a truck horn blows and Stan stands to see who it is. Kenny joins him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, you\'ve got to be shittin\' me. \'\'[Mel Gibson closes in fast in his Mad Max gas truck and wearing Braveheart face paint]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|Give me back my money! \'\'[blows his horn again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Goddamn, that guy\'s crazy. \'\'[hops off his seat and runs up to the driver]\'\' Hey dude, you\'ve gotta speed up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mel Gibson is chasing after us. You\'ve gotta go faster.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|Haha, very funny, kid. Sit down and stop playing games.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m not playing games. Mel Gibson is right behind you and he\'s gonna- \'\'[Mel plows into the bus, making both vehicles screech. The riders sway in their seats]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|What the hell?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|\'\'[shaking his fist in the air]\'\' Haaaa! K\'Plaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|Hey! That\'s Mel Gibson!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. I told you that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|Well, what the hell does he want?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He wouldn\'t give us our money back for \'\'The Passion\'\', so we kinda took it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|You didn\'t like \'\'The Passion\'\'? But it shows how Christ suffered for you. Mel Gibson is a very spiritual man. \'\'[Mel rams into them again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Bijou, night. The synagogue\'s congregation moves quickly down the street towards the theater.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[to his parents]\'\' Both you guys, stop! Please. You\'re gonna make people hate us more!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ticket Salesman|Can I help you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rabbi|This movie is causing anti-Semitism! You must remove it from your theater!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Congregants|That\'s right! Yeah! Remove your movie!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shlomo|Remove it from the theater? Fat chance!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 10|We demand you stop showing it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Congregants|Yeah! Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[facing the congregants]\'\' No, no, no! Don\'t become an angry mob! \'\'[behind him Cartman is seen leading his mob to the theater]\'\' The last time we did that we killed Jesus!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[points]\'\' Juden!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jack|What\'s going on here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ticket Salesman|They\'re trying to have \'\'The Passion\'\' pulled from the theater.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rabbi|This film is anti-Semitic and it must be stopped!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 11|Nonsense! Mel Gibson is a smart and spiritual man! There\'s nothing anti-Semitic about it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Elise|It has reaffirmed all of our faith in Christ.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rabbi|It\'s made one of our little Jewish boys want to apologize for the death of Jesus!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jack|Well, maybe you \'\'should\'\' apologize.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mob|That\'s right! What he said.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman 5|How dare you?! \'\'[the sound of a truck is faintly heard, but gets stronger.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[noticing]\'\' Look out!! \'\'[The crowds move to the other side of the street as the tour bus skids to a stop just past the theater.

Gibson! \'\'[brightens and approaches him, then grovels at his feet]\'\' Oh mein Savior! Mein Führer! You\'re actually here! Mr. Gibson, I have assembled the masses!

You boys have led me here to your secret base, huh? I guess now you\'re gonna start torturing me! Well! \'\'[grabs his nipples and falls on his knees. The crowd steps back as he twists his nipples]\'\' Oh, my nipples are so tender! Don\'t squeeze them anymore!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ticket Salesman|That\'s... Mel Gibson?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jack|H- he\'s not... quite as eloquent as I had pictured.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|\'\'[backs up towards a building]\'\' Yeah... \'\'[grabs a piece of crap from his ass and removes it from his briefs, turns around, and defaces the building]\'\' I\'ll bet you wanna torture me now, don\'t you?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[joins Stan and Kenny]\'\' Dude, what\'s wrong with him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s koo-koo, dude. He\'s absolutely out of his mind.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|You! You would all love to torture me, wouldn\'t you? \'\'[gets down on all fours and hoists his ass up]\'\' Okay, fine. See what you can fit in there, I can take it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude! I\'ve been freaked out this whole time because of that guy\'s movie?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|\'\'[rises and walks up to the boys]\'\' Fine! If nobody here is man enough to torture me, then just give me my eighteen dollars!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s our eighteen dollars! Your movie sucked!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|You \'\'can\'t\'\' say my movie sucked, or else you\'re saying Christianity sucked!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, dude, if you wanna be Christian, that\'s cool, but, you should follow what Jesus taught instead of how he got killed. Focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the Dark Ages and it ends up with really bad results.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jack|You know, he\'s right, Elise. We shouldn\'t focus our faith on the torture and execution of Christ.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ticket Salesman|Yeah. Lots of people got crucified in those times. We shouldn\'t rely on violence to inspire faith.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aw, aw, no, come on, people, we\'re so close to completing my final solution!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, dude, I feel so much better about being Jewish now that I see that Mel Gibson is just a big wacko douche. \'\'[a grinning Mel squats and farts on Cartman, defecating on Cartman]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mel|Woohoohoo!
