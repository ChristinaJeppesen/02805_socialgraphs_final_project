Six kids sit on the bleachers in the otherwise empty building - four boys, two girls. They look somewhat like the Goth kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lead Vampire|Isn\'t this cool? This time of day nobody\'s in the gym. We should make this one of our official South Park Vampires Club hangouts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Spiky Vampire|That\'s an awesome new coat, Mike.

Do you like these sparkles I got?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[into his recorder]\'\' Annie Bartlett is a psi vampire.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Yeah, I\'m more a sanguinarian vampire, in that I rely more on the life force energy, per se.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Spiky Vampire|Heh, yeah, I\'m gonna be a hybrid vampire, both psi and sanguinarian.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That\'s Ryan Ellis. Looks like they\'ve gotten to him too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bloodrayne|Lunchtime\'s almost over. Should we drink some more blood?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Other Vampires|Yeah! Cool!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Yeah, and then I think it\'s time for us to feed, per se. \'\'[opens a bottle of Clamato and pours some into the Bloodrayne\'s goblet.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh God I think they\'re gonna drink blood now.

Until he looks around and jumps from being startled]\'\' AAHHH!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Ummm, what are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[jumps away and whips out a golden cross]\'\' Get back! You stay back! Hwa! Heah! The body of Christ compels you! The body of Christ compels you! \'\'[runs away without his tape recorder]\'\' Hwaaaahh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school hallway, later. Mike is at his locker}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bloodrayne|That kid was really scared of us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|That\'s true, Bloodrayne.

They wear plastic fangs and drink freaking Clamato juice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Henrietta|But they can\'t dress like that. That\'s our style.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Midnight Vampire|Hey, Tommy Petros is thinking he might wanna be a Vamp kid too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Tommy Petros? Is he cool?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bloodrayne|Yeah, he\'s cool enough.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|All right. \'\'[the Vamps and Goths face each other]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|So, all of a sudden you Justin and Britney wannabes think it\'s cool to dress like us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|We dress the way our souls feel, to express the darkness, per se.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|Aren\'t you Mike Makowski?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|That\'s Vampir Makowski now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Henrietta|You kids need to all go put your freakin\' Banana Republic clothes back on, right now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sparkly Vampire|Hey, we\'re just as dark as you guys, maybe darker!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|Really. Do you guys even smoke?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Of course not. Smoking\'s bad for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Other Vamps|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|\'\'[buries his face in his left hand]\'\' Oh my God.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|You know, you guys are really giving off a negative human energy. We prefer to take our darkness somewhere else, per se.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|All right, Count Fagula, you go do that. \'\'[the Vamps leave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, after school. Butters runs inside in a panic, looks around, then heads for the sofa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Mom, Mom, I gotta tell you somethin\'! You\'re not gonna believe it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|\'\'[sewing a scarf]\'\' Not now, Butters. Your father wants to have a talk with you in the kitchen. He is not happy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh no, what\'d I do this time?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|You just march on in there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[hangs his head and goes in]\'\' Oh jeez...}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kitchen. Butters walks in and looks at Stephen, who\'s by the sink waiting with his arms crossed. To his left are a glass of milk and a box of Hamburger Helper.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|You see this, Butters?! It\'s a glass of milk I poured for myself! And you see this?! \'\'[holds up the box]\'\' It\'s Hamburger Helper! Now would you mind telling me what Hamburger Helper is doing in this glass of milk?! \'\'[Butters begins to tap his fists together, nervously]\'\' Why is Hamburger Helper in a glass of milk, Butters?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I have no idea, sir.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|I\'ll tell you why! \'\'[walks over to the pantry and opens the door]\'\' Our pantry is always kept organized alphabetically! But somebody put the Hamburger Helper where the Nestle Quik is supposed to go!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh, I\'m sorry, Dad. I-It\'s just I\'ve been really preoccupied lately. See, there are these kids at school, they were-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|What keeps a family together, Butters?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|A well-organized pantry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|That\'s right! \'\'[starts throwing food out of the pantry on to the floor]\'\' If you keep putting food under the wrong letter, it all goes wrong! \'\'[stops]\'\' Now you will reorganize this entire pantry, and you will do it right!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, okay, but, Dad, you\'ve gotta listen to me. Kids at school are starting to change. They\'ve been acting-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|You do it right now or you\'re going to be grounded! You got that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[hangs his head]\'\' Yes, sir. \'\'[Stephen walks away. Butters turns to the task at hand and begins putting stuff away]\'\' Jeez. Nobody will even listen to me. It\'s like nobody even cares if there\'s vampires at the school. I try to help and all I ever do is get hollered at. I bet vampires never get hollered at. Vampires just get to do whatever they want. \'\'[stops and thinks]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, next day, recess. The Vamp kids are on the merry-go-round gathered around Vampir}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|<poem><i>\n\'\'[reading from a book]\'\' ...All mortals share a soft repose,My soul doth dreadful vigils keep, More keen than which hell scarcely knows.\n</poem></i>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sparkly Vampire|What is that kid doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[walks towards them with hands outstretched]\'\' Oh Jesus, oh God, Butters, what are you doing? \'\'[pulls out the crucifix he used on them a few days before and sets it down on the snow, then continues towards them, hands outstretched]\'\' I- I\'m Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|So?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|O creatures of the night, I seek audience to engage with thee in unholy darnation and thus do... a-a-and thus do unto your bidding!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, uh... I wanna be a vampire.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cowlick Vampire|You\'re not cool enough to be one of us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, I know, but uhhh, I think I would make a really good vampire if you just, well, just give me the opportunity.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|We\'ll think about it. Go get us some sodas out of the pop machine in the commons.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yes! Yes, anything else?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Midnight Vampire|I want some Cheetos.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Soda and Cheetos, yes. I\'ll be right back.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Goth Corner at South Park Elementary. The Goth kids are listening to music as a soccer ball rolls to a stop in front of them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singer|\'\'I\'m not part of your society. I don\'t follow your fads and rules.

Do you see where it went?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 2|\'\'[with black hair]\'\' Yeah, it\'s right over there by those vampire kids. \'\'[Boy 1 retrieves the ball and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|\'\'[delayed reaction]\'\' What? Hey. Hey! We aren\'t vampire kids, we\'re freakin\' Goths!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 1|Whatever, Dracula, why don\'t you turn into a bat or something?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|So lame. So... lame...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Henrietta|You guys, I do not wanna be grouped in with douchey, little vampire kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|Sooo lame! \'\'[two Vamps walk out of the door behind him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Little Vamp|See? Isn\'t it cool back here? It\'s all dark and isolated.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shades Vamp|This would be a great place for a Vampire meeting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Henrietta|Get out of our space, you little twerps!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|More preppy straight-A students turning into vampires. What the hell is going on?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The woods, night. Butters is walking through them with drinks and some food. He reaches a small campfire where five of the six Vamps wait for him. Vampir is missing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I have done what you\'ve asked. \'\'[sets down the goods]\'\' A case of Dr Pepper and Cherry Twizzlers. Who are you gonna give this to? I-I mean, vampires can\'t eat people food.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|\'\'[walks into view]\'\' You have done well. Are you ready to become one of us, per se?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, I guess.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Are you sure? Because once you\'re in South Park Vampire Society, you can\'t ever leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well I\'m sick of bein\'- bein\' pushed around. M-by my dad, by kids at school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Then it is time for your transformation, per se. Let it begin! \'\'[they all walk away, leaving behind the Dr. Pepper and Twizzlers. They walk to South Park Mall]\'\' This way. Prepare thyself. \'\'[the mall is still open, so they walk over to Hot Topic and enter. The Vamps begin checking out clothes for Butters to wear as a new Vamp. The Midnight Vamp gets some fake teeth with fangs while the Cowlick Vamp gets some necklaces and rings. They outfit Butters with them. The Sparkly Vamp gets some hairspray and she and the Spiky Vamp spray Butters\' hair with it. Bloodrayne measures him for collars and bracelets. Finally, all six Vamps step away, and a new Vamp is born]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Whoa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|And now you shall drink vampire blood, and your transformation will be complete, per se! \'\'[walks away and pours out a bottle of Clamato juice into a goblet for Butters to drink]\'\' With this, thy transformation is done. \'\'[Butters takes a sip, then immediately spits it out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, that tastes awful! Blagh, blagh. \'\'[the Vamps leave Hot Topic]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|It is finished! Welcome, Butters, to the South Park Society of Vampires. \'\'[Butters begins to laugh, then cackle.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' home, night.

You are grounded for two weeks, you got that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|You can\'t ground me! For I am neither living nor dead!

You\'ve got the wrong flippin\' people.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|\'\'[slowly, for emphasis]\'\' We aren\'t vampires.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|I know that you aren\'t really vampires, and I appreciate that you wanna be cool because vampires are the "in" thing right now, but-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|We aren\'t trying to be popular!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria| -but just make sure that this new little trend doesn\'t become a distraction. \'\'[the door opens behind the Goths]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[enters with Vampir and two younger Vamps]\'\' Here\'s a couple more, Principal Victoria, hm\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Oh, oh no, are we in trouble?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|I was just telling your friends about what I expect of your-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|\'\'[slowly, for emphasis]\'\' We aren\'t friends!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vampir|Don\'t worry, Ma\'am.

This thing isn\'t going to stop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|Let\'s just face it: they bogarted our style! Everyone\'s gonna think we\'re trying to be butthole vampires now. We might as well go to the freakin\' Gap and just buy normal clothes. \'\'[they all look at each other thoughtfully]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Goth Corner, a day or two later. The Goths are now dressed as normal kids, but their hair is still colored as before.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|Well, at least nobody can refer to us as vampire kids now. \'\'[the soccer ball bounces towards the Goth kids again and stops in front of Henrietta]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 1|It went this way?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 3|\'\'[with very short hair]\'\' Yeah, it\'s over there by that fat girl, the big-nosed kid, the midget, and the kid with pock marks on his face. \'\'[Boy 1 sees the ball, walks over, picks it up, and leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|So we\'re back to that, are we?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Firkle|Shit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|\'\'[stands up]\'\' Let\'s get out of these freakin\' Gap clothes.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s room, night.

Why is this happening, I mean... why now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|Doesn\'t matter why.

Over the past week there\'s been a lot of confusion, and so we have asked for this assembly to clarify the difference between Goth kids and Vampire kids. Let us make it abundantly clear: if you hate life, truly hate the sun, and need to smoke and drink coffee, you are Goth. If, however, you like dressing in black \'cause it\'s "fun", enjoy putting sparkles on your cheeks and following the occult while avoiding things that are bad for your health, then you are most likely a douchebag vampire wannabe boner. Because anybody who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded. \'\'[everyone begins to applaud the speech.
