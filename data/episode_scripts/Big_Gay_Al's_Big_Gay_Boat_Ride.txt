You\'re making me sick, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s part Doberman and part wolf. He\'s the toughest dog on the mountain.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No way. Everybody knows that Sylvester is the toughest dog in South Park.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sylvester|Arrrrrr.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s not meaner than Sparky.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh yeah? Let\'s see.

Both dogs growl.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That\'s it, Sparky! Kick his ass!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky lunges after Sylvester and out of view. Aggressive panting can be heard. The boys stand there, shocked.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Huh. He\'s doing something to his ass. He\'s not kicking his ass, but he\'s definitely doing something to his ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sparky! Bad dog!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Oh my God, I think they\'re screwing.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah dude, I think your dog is gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What do you mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That dog is a gay homosexual.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan looks back to study the situation, then...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s just confused.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I think the other dog\'s the one that\'s confused.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(No, check his penis.)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle smiles.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sick, shut up dude!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky pants happily while Sylvester slinks away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|<poem><i>Stan\'s dog\'s a homo.

That football is like making love to a reeeeeally beautiful woman. You can\'t always score, but when you do, it makes all the trying worthwhile. \'\'[silence]\'\' Now, let\'s start practice.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Chef blows his whistle, and the kids hit the field.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Uh, Mr. Chef, sir?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Yes Pip, what is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Uh, I still don\'t have a helmet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I know, Pip, the school can\'t afford helmets for everybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Yes, but, couldn\'t we rotate who doesn\'t have a helmet every week?

Hut-hut-hut. Hut-hut-hut-hut-hut-hut.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|\'\'[impatiently]\'\' Hike the damn ball!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman hikes the ball over Stan\'s head. Stan chases it down.

Oh, fine, fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|I don\'t have to remind you just how important this game is to us South Park alumni.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Elementary school alumni?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|That\'s as far as most of us got. You think we have a shot at beating the spread against Middle Park this year?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I don\'t know. Wha- what\'s the spread?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Middle Park by 70 points.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Hmmm...}}\n{{ScriptScene|They look towards the field, where Kenny tackles Cartman, causing him to drop the ball.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I don\'t think we have a chance.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Nonsense! Not with my nephew at quarterback. \'\'[yells]\'\' Right Stanley?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan turns to see his uncle just as Cartman hikes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The ball hits him on the side of the head.

That was a good practice children. We\'ll see you here again tomorrow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey Stan, isn\'t that your dog?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, he must have followed me to football practice. You see, he \'\'is\'\' smart.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Aw, my dog Rex follows me to football practice all the time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, but my dog found his own way here. That makes him smarter than your- \'\'[sees Sparky lunge after Rex]\'\' Sparky, get down!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Oh my God! What is he doing to my dog?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|There he goes again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Get down, Sparky! Down!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Stan forgot to mention that his dog is a gay homosexual.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Make him stop!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Rex moves away with his tail between his legs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rex|Yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe yipe!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fosse and Bill pass by laughing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fosse|I\'m sure glad my dog isn\'t gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|Yeah, maybe you should name your dog Sparkette, Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fosse|Gay dog.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bullies walk away laughing, while Sparky walks up panting.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison\'s classroom. Start of school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...and so you see, Simon & Simon were not brothers in real life, only on television.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Thank you for that presentation, Eric, but the assignment was on Asian cultures. You get a D-.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ah, dammit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Who should we call on next, Mr. Hat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Hat|Well, how about Stan, our little South Park quarterback star?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh, good idea. Okay Stanley, you\'re next.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Um, I\'m not really prepared either.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well, just make something up, like Eric did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, uh...

A-.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Eeyy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow, cool!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wait a minute, why the hell does he get an A-?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Eric, Stanley just might lead our team to victory against the Middle Park Cowboys for the first time in decades. And we treat star athletes better because they\'re better people.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s not fair!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Hat|Life isn\'t fair, kiddo, get used to it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Stupid puppet.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Dismissal bell rings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Don\'t forget your assignments tonight children, they\'re due tomorrow for everybody but Stan.}}\n{{ScriptScene|All students except Stan leave the room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mr. Garrison, can I ask you a question?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well of course Stanley, what is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What\'s a... homosexual?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Hoh, well, Stanley, I guess you came to the right person. Sit down.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan sits.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Stanley, gay people... Well. gay people are evil. Evil right down to their cold, black hearts, which pump not blood like yours and mine, but rather a thick, vomitous oil that oozes through their rotten veins and clots in their pea-sized brains which becomes the cause of their Nazi-esque patterns of violent behavior. Do you understand?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I guess.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Good, I\'m glad we could have this little talk, Stanley. Now you go outside and practice football like a good little heterosexual.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bus stop. The boys get off the bus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys see me block that defense today? I was kicking ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You\'re gonna need to kick more ass than that to beat the Cowboys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey, speaking of pounding ass, here comes Stan\'s little homo dog.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Shut up, dude!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky comes up panting with a pink scarf on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sparky, where\'d you get that pink scarf?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sparky|Bark, bark.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Man, that is the gayest dog I have ever seen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He just needs some training, that\'s all. Sit, Sparky.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky sits.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Good boy, now shake.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky shakes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Good boy. Now, don\'t be gay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan waits for the command to sink in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t be gay, Spark. Don\'t be gay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky looks at Stan with confusion and growls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Did it work?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|He still looks pretty gay to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|Huh, huh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fosse|Hey Stan, your dog been to any Pride marches lately?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|Huh huh, meh, yeah, maybe you should take him to a Barbra Streisand concert. \'\'[they laugh]\'\' Stupid little gay dog.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fosse|Gay dog.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on you guys, I have an idea.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sports Book, Ned and Jimbo enter. Two big-screen monitors show horse races. One of the five smaller screens above show a race as well.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|I want $500 on the South Park Cows.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bookie|Are you crazy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|No siree. I\'m telling you, I got the line. My nephew Stan is the best quarterback the school has ever seen. I guarantee they\'ll beat the spread.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gambler 1|I want to put all my money on the Cows.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gambler 2|Duh, duh, I think I\'ll put 300 on the Cows too if they guarantee it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gambler 3|Hey, I want to put some money on the Cows too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Female Gambler 1|I got 500 on the Cows.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Female Gambler 2|Well, I\'ll put my money on the Cows.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Whoa, whoa. Don\'t get too carried away now uh...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gambler 4|You better be right about this, Jimbo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hehe, yeah. Don\'t- don\'t worry yourself.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Are you sure Stan is that good?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Not \'\'that\'\' sure. I think we better come up with a backup plan. Uhh, let\'s see here. Hey, bookie! Wha- what\'s the halftime show gonna be?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bookie|You haven\'t heard?! John Stamos\' older brother Richard Stamos is gonna sing \'Loving You\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|I love that song.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|\'Loving You\'? That\'s perfect! Come on Ned, Middle Park\'s gonna get a Halftime show they\'ll never forget.}}\n{{ScriptScene|In front of Stan\'s house, a large crate sits next to the kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay Sparky, we got you a present. Now why don\'t-}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan notices a pink scarf on Sparky.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Damn it Sparky, where do you keep getting this thing?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He grabs the scarf.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No pink bandannas Sparky, bad dog! Now pay attention. Sparky, this is Fifi.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crate opens and Fifi, a French poodle, comes out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ooh-la-la.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fifi sniffs some. Sparky starts following her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|There he goes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Atta boy, Spark! Get her!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky climbs atop Fifi.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yes!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky pulls Fifi\'s collar off and into the air, catching it around his neck.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ah crap! Now what do I do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Who cares if your dog is gay? Maybe it\'s not that bad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No way dude, my mom says God hates gay people. That\'s why he smote the sodomies in France.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(I think that Garrison said that gay people suck.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I know Mr. Garrison said that homosexuals are evil, but, but Sparky doesn\'t seem evil.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, maybe Mr. Garrison is wrong. You should ask somebody else.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Like who?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Inside Stan\'s house, Jesus and Pals\' title screen is on TV.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|TV Announcer|And now back to Jesus and Pals on South Park public access.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus Christ|Yea, many of you are seeking answers, and I am the way for you my children.

I want a Rin-tin-tin!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sparky grouses, digs a hole, and makes his way out of the yard. He wanders into the mountains, looks back once more, and is gone.}}\n{{ScriptScene|On the sideline at practice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Now children, we\'ve got to handle the ball better.
