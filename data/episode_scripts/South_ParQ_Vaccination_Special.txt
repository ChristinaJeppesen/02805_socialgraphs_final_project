You gotta let us in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Stotch|\'\'[from the back of the line]\'\' No, no, you have to let in people with health issues first!

You wanna talk or you want me to talk?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(You can talk.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[while looking at Stan and Kyle]\'\' You guys, Kenny and I are feeling like, even though things are supposedly getting better with the pandemic, we\'re more depressed than ever. \'\'[Cartman and Kenny turn around to Stan and Kyle and Cartman lowers down his mask]\'\' The four of us just seem really different towards each other and we\'re worried the past year has put a strain to our broship. Kenny was saying he wants to do everything he can to save the broship, and I agree with him. So we had a really positive talk about it during lunch, and Kenny shared some ideas of how maybe we can navigate through this, and I think we came up with a great idea. Okay, so, you know how chicks have periods right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s true! Women have "periods" where they bleed from their vagina. Remember earlier today, Stan, you said our teacher was wearing white? So when we talked I said to Kenny "Oh, what if the teacher got her period?" which cheered us up a bit and then we realized today was hamburger day for lunch. There was lots of ketchup laying around. So me and Kenny snuck into the classroom during recess and put it on the teacher\'s chair, and now when we get back to class there\'s gonna be a bunch of ketchup \'\'[Stan and Kyle look at each other]\'\' on the teacher\'s chair and when she stands up it\'s gonna totally look like she got her period! \'\'[Kenny laughs]\'\' It\'s going to be amazing, you guys. I\'m so excited!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Classroom. The bell rings and the teacher, Mrs. Nelson, arrives in class.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Nelson|Okay, class. Hope everyone had a good lunch. \'\'[Cartman struggles to hold in his laughter]\'\' Okay, how did everyone do on their fractions? Are there any questions? \'\'[Mrs. Nelson approaches her desk]\'\' I know the last few were a little tricky. \'\'[she sits on the chair and a squish sound it\'s heard]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[barely holding his laugh and whispering]\'\' Shh!

Well, let\'s look at it together. \'\'[Mrs. Nelson gets up from her chair and when she turns around, a big red stain is seen on her back on the skirt.]}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Ewwwwww! \'\'[Cartman and Kenny laugh loudly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Nelson|What? \'\'[she sees the stain and panics]\'\' What? What is -- What is this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, my God. \'\'[Cartman points at her and takes out his phone, starting to film her]\'\' Teacher had her period. \'\'[he and Kenny continue to laugh loudly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Nelson|\'\'[embarrassed]\'\' Kids, something must be wrong with me.  \'\'[she starts to panic even more when Cartman and Kenny can\'t stop laughing]\'\' Is this a prank?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[continuing to film with his phone]\'\' That\'s nasty, teacher. Don\'t have your period during class time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Nelson|\'\'[in the same panic state]\'\' Do you think this is funny? I come here, and I risk my life to teach you? And I can\'t even get a vaccination because teachers aren\'t important enough?! \'\'[Cartman and Kenny stop laughing]\'\' And I get on the websites and can\'t even get a straight answer on when I\'ll get vaccinated?! Well, I\'m over it! \'\'[she opens the classroom door]\'\' I can\'t do this anymore! \'\'[she leaves the classroom]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys, I think that might have been the single most hilarious thing we\'ve ever done.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys walk along the street past the Stotch residence, coming from school.

Should we post the one where you can see the most blood on teacher\'s ass or the one where she makes the dumbest face?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[the boys suddenly stop, right in front of Butters\' house]\'\' You\'re not posting anything! Do you have any idea what you\'ve done?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(What do you mean, dude?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, we finally get back to school and have some sense of normalcy and you guys make the teacher walk out!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey, at least Kenny and I were doing something to try and get that spark back. You know 30 percent of broships didn\'t make it through the pandemic?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What if they make us go back to remote learning?! I don\'t want to go back to being quarantined at home like some of the other kids still are!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[from the window]\'\' Hey, fellas! \'\'[the boys turn around facing the house]\'\' Anything fun happen at school today?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, you missed it! It was the best thing ever! \'\'[shows the phone]\'\' We put ketchup in the teacher\'s seat and made her think it was her period!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, my gosh! That sounds like so much fun!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, pretty much greatest day of our lives.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[turns to the boys]\'\' Do you guys know how hard it\'s going to be for them to find us a replacement teacher?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s not gonna be hard. They\'ll bring in some lame ass teacher who\'s desperate to work. How bad can it be?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Main Street, a bus arrives.

Your, sabbatical was somewhat controversial.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well, I just went through a little thing. You know, I... I realized I was gay. And then I realized I wasn\'t gay, I was a woman. And after I transitioned, I thought it was a little mistake and then I went through a phase of being the President of the United States.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Well, that is the problem, Mr. Garrison, as someone who previously identified as President, there could be safety issues.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh, that\'s not a problem. Anyone who has been President is assigned secret service for the rest of their lives to keep them protected. \'\'[looks at the door]\'\' Mr. Service! \'\'[an agent looking-man with no pants on him arrives and Garrison presents him to the principals]\'\' This is my private security, Mr. Service.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Service|Hello.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Uh, thank you for your application, Mr. Garrison. We\'ll keep you in mind as a backup, but hopefully the vaccination process is going to start opening up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Walgreens, the generic club song can still be heard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man with Green Coat|Come on, man, it\'s ridiculous that people can\'t get in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man with Burgundy Coat|Yeah, you know, in Israel they vaccinate everybody.

It\'s not good for us and it\'s not good for him. \'\'[he turns around, taking his hands out of his pockets and resting against the wall]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[lifts the cooler with the vaccines]\'\' We still have a bunch of vaccines here. What happens now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I think I have a plan.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Scene cuts to a news broadcast.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|And explosive powder keg of humanity is set to go off at South Park Elementary! \'\'[camera cuts to the chaos unfolding at the school]\'\' Thousands of people have turned up to get their shot -- that one shot that could change everything. But also in the crowd are several people who want to stop those vaccines from happening. At the center of it all -- that amazing group of kids who are just taking the time for what they believe is right. I\'m talking, of course, about the Lil\' Qties. A group of youngsters that believe vaccines are harmful --}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|\'\'[cutting him off]\'\' Yeah -- yeah, I see what you did there, Tom. That\'s real fucking cute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|I\'m not trying to be cute. I\'m saying if these kids really believe the horrific things they believe, then they\'d be bad people not to go out and do something about it, wouldn\'t they?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|\'\'[waving his arm dismissively]\'\' Yes, that\'s totally true if you\'re a corrupt dickhead without morals. You gotta be fucking --}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|Okay, okay, Chris, let\'s just get back to the weather.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|Yeah, let\'s get back to the weather, you cunt.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The arctic.

My balls are freezing, sir.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[turns back to Bob White]\'\' Mr. Service\'s balls are freezing!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob|\'\'[turns to face them]\'\' Don\'t give in to them! They\'re trying to make a joke of everything! That\'s what they do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|How do the elites control Mr. Service\'s balls?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob|You still don\'t get it, do you?! They don\'t just drink adrenochrome, they run the show! The whole damn show! \'\'[a cursor appears suddenly, messing with Bob\'s appearance]\'\' It come down to two people -- \'\'[he realizes what\'s happening to him]\'\' Oh, you don\'t like that, do you?! That\'s getting a little close to home, huh?! You can\'t control me anymore, you sons of bitches! \'\'[the cursor continues to alter Bob in various ways]\'\' They\'re making fun of me to try and discredit my beliefs! \'\'[he is transformed into an obese woman wearing a dress, then a large penis]\'\' Oh, you don\'t like that, do you!? Don\'t want the world to know that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[he turns around]\'\' Listen! Listen, whoever you are! I don\'t give a shit what you do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob|What?! What are you saying?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Please! I just want my old life back!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob|No, stop! They\'re monsters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|I don\'t care what you do to kids, I just want people to like me again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob|You son of a bitch! Aah! \'\'[he runs towards Mr. Garrison]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Aah! Mr. Service!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Suddenly the show freezes.

Hey, come back!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The frame turns, everything returning to normal, albeit mirrored.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|How would you like to make a deal?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Service|\'\'[grunts]\'\' Aah! Aah! \'\'[the cursor shrinks him down.

The magic is gone and we are through, is that right? \'\'[camera turns to reveal Stan and Kyle sitting at a table]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yup.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Uh huh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But we all want what\'s best for Kenny, so we have to find a way to compromise and move on with our lives. So how do we do it? We use... a 2-2-3. \'\'[he flips the page, revealing a calendar with a schedule written on it]\'\' Kyle, you have Kenny for two days starting on Monday. I have Kenny Thursday and Friday, and then, Stan, you get him for the weekend. Then we switch where I have Kenny starting Monday, Stan gets two days and Kyle gets a weekend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Do we really have to do this? That- that all seems overly confusing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, so we can go alternating weeks -- \'\'[he flips the page]\'\' Each one of us has Kenny for six days and then we rotate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|A week is a long time for Kenny to be with one person.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[flips page]\'\' Alternating weeks with a midweek visit. We have longer stretches, but a change for a break.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Aw, come on. What about sleepovers? We can\'t take those away from Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[flips page]\'\' Alternating weeks with midweek overnight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It would be easier if I just knew I always had Kenny on certain days.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[flips page]\'\' 3-3-4-4 rotation. Makes everyone\'s days consistent -- oh, hang on on a second, guys. \'\'[he opens the door to check on Kenny, who is sitting in the hallway]\'\' Everything okay, buddy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[he looks up from his iPad]\'\' (Yeah, what\'s going on?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We\'re almost done in here, Kenny. You liking that birthday cake-flavored ice cream?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah, it\'s fine, but I --)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[cuts him off]\'\' Okay, you\'re doing great, pal. \'\'[he shuts the door]\'\' The 3-3-4-4 is the most consistent, but to change weekends, we would need... \'\'[flips page]\'\' the 2-2-5-5 rotation, where the weekends can actually fluctuate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I don\'t even know what to say...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I say that out of all of those... the first one makes the most sense.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[he flips back to the second page]\'\' The 2-2-3, I agree. This way we don\'t have to be bros but Kenny still has the best possible life.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[he gets out of his chair]\'\' 2-2-3. That\'s so ridiculous... that it just might work.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary. A news report is taking place.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|We\'ve just received devastating news here at South Park Elementary. It appears that the Kommunity Kidz... are breaking up. They have asked for people to... \'\'[he reads from a sheet of paper]\'\' "Respect their privacy in these difficult times," and it appears that the strain of this pandemic, from people like you, Tom, was just too much.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|\'\'[rolls his eyes]\'\' Oh, here we go, here we go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|Yeah, here we go!You just couldn\'t leave \'em alone, could you, ya prick?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|Okay, let\'s just --}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|They broke up \'cause of you and your stupid -- wait.

You\'re gonna get yourself killed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[approaches Kyle on the right]\'\' This isn\'t our fight anymore, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We set out to do something. I\'m not letting our broship fall to the pandi just yet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright... then let\'s get those vaccines to the teachers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, let\'s do this.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys face the crowd of Qanons, Lil Qties, and adults waiting for the vaccine.

Listen, everybody. I -- I think I owe you all a big apology. I came in here expecting everything to just go back to normal, but... we\'ve all been through the proverbial butthole of hardships lately. I thought we could all just magically be friends again. But relationships are very fragile things. \'\'[Stan, Kyle, and Cartman look at each other]\'\' And in times of crises when we need each other most, it\'s sometimes when we grow furthest apart. But through it all, Mr. White here has taught me a very important lesson. Make sure you\'re on the side of the people with the most power. And so, I\'ve worked out a deal with some pretty powerful people... \'\'[looks up at the sky]\'\' Alright, boys, do your thing!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A low bass tone sounds and fireworks explode in the air. Everyone in the crowd gasps. Air Israel planes appear.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|It\'s Air Israel with enough vaccines for every adult in town!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd cheers, running to the plane to get vaccinated. An Israeli man begins throwing boxes full of vaccines to the citizens of South Park.

You\'re alright, Garrison!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[laughs, putting his hands on his hips]\'\' Oh, jeez. Thanks, everybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, come on you guys!

Father Maxi is speaking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father Maxi|As a teacher, Mrs. Nelson did everything she could for her students. So it seems even more unfair that she... was just a few days late in getting the vaccine before she died of COVID. And now as Mr. Garrison takes over teaching for Mrs. Nelson permanently... \'\'[Scott Malkinson begins sobbing; Mr. Garrison is smiling]\'\' I think we should all take a moment to say... Hey!
