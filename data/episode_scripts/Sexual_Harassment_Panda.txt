You sue for money, but where do you think that money comes from? From the schools, from taxes, from the state. From you. \'\'[The courtroom is silent, listening]\'\' There\'s no such thing as free money. When you sue somebody, you take money away from parks and schools and charities, and put it in your own pocket.

I\'m "Don\'t Sue People" Panda, with an important message for you! Lawsuits damage our society. I know it\'s tempting to make money, but just remember: that money has to come from somewhere.
