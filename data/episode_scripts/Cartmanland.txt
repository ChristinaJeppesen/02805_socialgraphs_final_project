How\'s the hemorrhoid today?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[the nurse leaves]\'\' Awesome. \'\'[Gerald and Sheila take their seats near Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Kyle, we wanna tell you about the Book of Job. It\'s a story from the Bible.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'ve had enough of the Bible. What has it gotten me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Oh, I think you\'ll see differently after hearing this. Sit down, Kyle. \'\'[Kyle gets cross, and Gerald corrects himself]\'\' Uh, okay. \'\'[begins the story. A Middle Eastern scene appears]\'\' You see, Job lived in the east of Jordan, a long long time ago. \'\'[camera pans across the landscape and rests behind a man in a red robe and long gray hair]\'\' Job was a great man. He was blessed with ten lovely children \'\'[they come out of a building with their mother]\'\', a wonderful wife, and many friends. \'\'[his friends show up to join the family behind Job, a proud and happy man]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|\'\'[a shot of Job petting a bull]\'\' He was godly, and a good man, and fed the poor. \'\'[Job brings a bag of food to a woman with three kids next to her. One of them, a girl, walks up, and her mother hands her a loaf of bread]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|He was the most upright and honorable of men, and every day he praised God. \'\'[Job falls to his knees in praise, as his shepherds look on]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|But one day, Satan went up to Heaven and talked to God.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[still mad]\'\' Satan talked to God?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Yes, in the Book of Job, Satan talks to God. And God says to Satan, "Have you seen Job? He is a great man, and he praises me every day."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|But Satan said, "Oh yeah? He only praises you because you gave him so much. If you didn\'t give him those things, he would curse your name."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|To which God said, "Oh yeah? I\'ll show you, Satan! I\'ll take those things away from Job and he will still praise my name."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|And so, God had a bunch of barbarians come in and slaughter Job\'s oxen and donkeys, and murder all his workers. \'\'[that scene is shown]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Then God sent his fireballs from the sky and killed his sheep and the rest of his employees. \'\'[meteorites rain down and destroy the fields and workers there, as well as the sheep]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|And then, as Job\'s sons and daughters were eating, God sent a mighty wind to collapse the house and crush and kill them all. \'\'[the palm trees bend low as the winds pick up, then the two-story house collapses as the palm trees are swept away by the winds, and Job\'s family dies]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Job was terribly sad, but he fell to his knees and said, "The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away," and praised God\'s name. \'\'[Job falls to his knees and prays to God.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|So then, Job got painful sores all over his body. \'\'[shown, with the burning fields behind him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|He was in terrible, miserable pain all day, every day. But he still kept his faith. \'\'[another shot of Job among the dead, then a close-up of Job with his sores]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|God said to Satan, "See? I told you. Job still praises me." \'\'[all that is heard after that is the sound of the heart monitor attached to Kyle.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[a few seconds later]\'\' And that\'s it? That\'s the end?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Basically.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s the most horrible story I\'ve ever heard. Why would God do such a horrible thing to a good person just to prove a point to Satan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Oh. Uhhh, I don\'t know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Then I was right. Job has all his children killed, and Michael Bay gets to keep making movies. There isn\'t a God.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartmanland, day. Yet another crowd of people awaits to get in. Cartman greets them}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[checking off items on a clipboard]\'\' ...And, since the stupid security guard needs video surveillance, I have to let in two \'\'more\'\' people a day to cover \'\'those\'\' expenses... Need to cover the new ticket guy\'s salary, so that\'s three more admissions a day... \'\'[the clipboard reads, "Cartmanland Expenses."]\'\' Cleanup crew for the bathroom, money to cover paint and upkeep - so that\'s about four admissions - that brings the grand total to... \'\'[under his breath]\'\' God-damnit! \'\'[picks up the bullhorn and says]\'\' Eight hundred and sixteen people can come into the park today! \'\'[the crowd hoots and hollers and surges forward, engulfing Cartman. The people rush towards the one open ticket booth]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|Welcome to Cartmanland.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hells Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has been in to see Kyle\'s recovery progress and is now talking to the parents}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Isn\'t he getting any better, doctor?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|I don\'t understand it. He\'s not fighting the infected hemorrhoid at all. It\'s like he... like he\'s lost all hope. Well if you\'ll excuse me, I\'ve got more tests to run. \'\'[leaves. The TV monitor is seen, with a picture of a financial program]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|And now back to \'\'Money Quest\'\', on HBC.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host 1|\'\'[Camera zooms in on the two hosts]\'\' Welcome back to \'\'Money Quest\'\'. \'\'[Kyle looks at the show]\'\' In just over two weeks, young financial genius Eric Cartman \'\'[his picture appears on the screen behind the hosts]\'\' has managed to turn a theme park that was seeing less than a hundred attendees a day into a thriving park with attendance in the thousands.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host 2|And the way he did it is with the brilliant "You Can\'t Come" technique. For the first several days, the young businessman saturated the market with the claim that nobody could get into his park. It made the public crazy. So then, weeks later, when he opened the doors, they were lining up around the block. Simply amazing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host 1|Well, ahah I think we should point out that this technique is already being applied by businesses all over the country.}}\n{{ScriptScene|At a restaurant where all the tables are empty and everyone is waiting in line...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Waitress|I\'m sorry, we\'re no longer taking reservations. Nobody can eat here. You\'ll have to leave now.}}\n{{ScriptScene|At the Bijou, where everyone is waiting outside....}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|No, I\'m sorry. You can\'t see this movie. Nobody can see this movie. \'\'I\'\' can\'t even go in.}}\n{{ScriptScene|At Gracy\'s clothing store, a sales associates barks orders...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Associate|\'\'[the shoppers rush out of there]\'\' Out! Nobody is allowed into Gracy\'s anymore! Get out of here! \'\'[kicks the last shopper out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back to \'\'Money Quest\'\'...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host 1|Amazing. Eric Cartman is surely the financial genius of our time.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back to Kyle\'s room at Hells Pass Hospital...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh... Oohh—Ohuhughughhh... \'\'[passes out. A flatline appears on the heart monitor]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|\'\'[approaches]\'\' Kyle? Kyle? \'\'[turns to Gerald]\'\' Get the doctor!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartmanland, day. Every ride has people on it, and every ride Cartman is on shows a dejected Cartman as the others enjoy themselves. At the Carousel he rides his favorite white horse, but shows no joy in riding it. At Java Jam!!! he\'s in a purple teacup with three other kids, and is not enjoying it. At Bumper Buggies he\'s in the #7 bumper car}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Bumped from ahead by car #9, Clyde]\'\' Eh! \'\'[Bumped from ahead by car #4, Kevin]\'\' Goddamnit, stop running into me! \'\'[at the Mine Shaft Ride he sits in the fist car, but is not enjoying it with all those other kids. Kenny is in the last car]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[around one bend]\'\' (Woohoo!) \'\'[around another]\'\' (Heeheehee!!) \'\'[he\'s out of his seat flying with the car, and he gets impaled in the face by a water pipe. It goes along for the ride. Outside, at Ride Shots, the shots from the just-completed ride are shown. Kenny is shown on screen 3 with the pipe buried into his face, which is now unrecognizable. On the steamboat ferry circling Adventure Island Cartman covers his ears and looks around angrily]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|AGH! \'\'[he\'s next in The Yeti log ride with older kids]\'\' DAAGGHHHH!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartmanland, Main Street. The crowds bustle about and business is good. Chris the Broker and Mr. Fun are seen walking down Main Street.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|My God, look at it, Chris! That kid completely turned this place around!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|He sure did!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|Oh, if I could only have a park that worked like \'\'this\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[approaches]\'\' Hey, there you are! \'\'[The two men see him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|Oh, hello. Congratulations on your success.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Just give me my money back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I changed my mind! I don\'t want your stupid park!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|...But it\'s doing great!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You call this great?! I call it hell! Trade me back, goddamnit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|\'\'[Chris smiles at this turn of events]\'\' You bet! I\'ll go get your money right now. \'\'[the men leave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy|\'\'[walking along]\'\' Daddy, daddy, can we ride the rockets?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'\'\'\'GODDAMNIT, GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!!\'\'\'\'\' \'\'[scares the hell out of the boy. The father holds on to the boy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, day. The doctor has brought Kyle\'s vitals back, and Kyle is on oxygen, but he\'s still unconscious. Gerald and Sheila look on}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Isn\'t he responding at all, doctor?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|\'\'[turns around to face them]\'\' I\'m sorry. Your son appears to be losing the battle. I\'m afraid that the hemorrhoid has spread to his lungs. Normally, the body would fight the infection, but he\'s... he\'s just... given up on life.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|But then... are you saying...?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|There\'s nothing I can do. Little fella\'s just... lost his will to live.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|\'\'[walks up to Kyle]\'\' Oh Kyle! Kyle, you\'ve got to fight!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartmanland... ahem, North Park Funland, day. The old North Park Funland sign is being restored, as are many of the rides Cartman replaced. The ticket booths are missing. A bulldozer sits outside the park ready to clear out anything else that needs removal. Cartman exits with the million dollars he originally paid for the park. The money is back on the Radio Flyer}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Good riddance, you stupid park! You can all kiss my ass! \'\'[three men in suits approach Cartman]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent|Excuse me? Eric Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[turns to face them]\'\' Yeah?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent|I\'m Frank Garrett with the IRS. You haven\'t kept records of your income or payout, and there\'s a five hundred thousand dollar discrepancy. \'\'[to the two other men]\'\' Seize the assets. \'\'[the men grab the discrepancy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|He-hey, that\'s my money!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrett|There\'s also the lawsuit of the little boy who died in your park. The family\'s entitled to the rest of this. \'\'[takes the wagon with the other half million]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?! Kenny?! He dies all the time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrett|You still owe thirteen thousand dollars more than this, Mr. Cartman. We\'ll see you in court. \'\'[the men walk away with the million]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ye-You can\'t take my money, Goddamnit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrett|We know how well your park is doing; you\'ll make it back in no time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No! But I don\'t... ah... ah... \'\'[sees Mr. Fun through a fence and rushes to talk to him]\'\' Hey! Hey Mr. Fun, I changed my mind. I need the park to make my money back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|Nohoho way, José!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But I\'m getting sued now. If I don\'t have the park, I lose everything!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Fun|"I don\'t care," said Pierre. "I\'m from France." \'\'[turns around and disappears into the crowd]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|This can\'t be happening! AGGGHH!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, day. Stan bursts into Kyle\'s room}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle, you gotta see!! \'\'[the doctor looks at him. Sheila and Gerald turn around]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|\'\'[sadly]\'\' Kyle\'s not going to make it, Stanley. Oh, Gerald! \'\'[weeps into Gerald\'s chest]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Doctor, can we wheel Kyle out of here on his bed with the machines attached?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|Well, I s-supposed it could be rigged, but I--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Then damnit man, do it!}}\n{{ScriptScene|North Park Funland, day. The ticket booths are back, and business is as strong now as it was when the park was Cartmanland. Off to the side, Cartman is throwing stones at one of the park walls}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It isn\'t fair! \'\'[throws another stone]\'\' You goddamned assholes, it isn\'t fair! \'\'[throws another. Stan arrives with the doctor, the nurse, Kyle, and Kyle\'s parents]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, Kyle. Look. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[opens his eyes]\'\' Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You just build me up to chop me down, didn\'t you?! What about my dream?!
