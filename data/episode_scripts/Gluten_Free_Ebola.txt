We\'ve gotta make it for someone in need so that people have to go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We lure people in with a cause and then hit \'em over the head with the best party ever.

I just want to make sure there\'s food for all of us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|DJ|Mark in Fairplay, you had a comment?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mark|Yeah, I agree with the last caller. I was in a restaurant and ordered the gluten-free quinoa salad, and a guy right next to me was eating a sandwich. It\'s like "Get your second-hand gluten away from me!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|DJ|All right, all right, next caller, you got a question for the boys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Yeah, I swear, if I hear another person talking about being gluten-free I\'m gonna piss in their face.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What the hell is gluten?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County community center, night. Most everyone in town is at the meeting tonight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John Garner|Hello everyone, my name is John Garner and I\'m a nutrition advisor from the USDA. I want to clarify the USDA\'s position on a healthy diet. There\'s been a lot of confusion about gluten lately. People saying that gluten is the cause of cancer, gluten should be avoided, gluten can make your dick fly off, but let\'s set the record straight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[To Gerald]\'\' Make your dick fly off?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John Garner|People believe that omitting gluten will make you healthier, but of course, that\'s a bunch of hooey. Hooey is the preservative found in processed foods, that we now believe is the main culprit of obesity. You might say "Well there\'s fat in butter too," but that\'s just poppycock. Poppycock first came from India and is the key ingredient in red meat which we now realize is good for you along with hooey. The good hooey, not the bad hooey. So what is gluten?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Yes, thank you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John Garner|Simply put, gluten is the protein found in flour when you take all the starch away. \'\'[holds up a stalk of wheat]\'\'. Flour is of course, just wheat, and when you add a liquid to flour, you get dough. \'\'[grabs a wad of dough]\'\' Dough that makes breads, doughnuts, pasta, and all the hooey-free foods that humans enjoy. \'\'[puts the dough into a special washer. The extract going through a distillation process]\'\' Now, if we wash the dough of all its starch, we can actually distil the wheat down, minus the water, minus the starch, and what we\'re left with is pure gluten. Not a bio-weapon, just harmless flour protein.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Then eat it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John Garner|Excuse me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|If it\'s not dangerous, then eat that pure concentrated gluten, okay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John Garner|\'\'[looks at the gluten, then at the audience, then moves the gluten to his lips]\'\' Yeah. Alright. \'\'[sips it down]\'\' Dup, dup. \'\'[his body contorts as he groans. Everyone in the audience begins to panic. He shows signs of burning up, and his groin begins to set off electrical sparks. His penis wriggles out of there and soon launches itself.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Oh, you see that? His dick\'s flyin\' off. \'\'[people begin to leave the community center. The penis escapes and comes back to knock a man down]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Papa John\'s Pizza is shown.
