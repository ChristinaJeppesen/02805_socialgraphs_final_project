We\'ll keep drawing. \'\'[Draws.]\'\' Whew.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[Draws]\'\' Whew.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sees that his straw is short and throws it away, behind himself.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Wooo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Wait a minute! Where the hell is the short one?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|The short what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Dammit, Barbrady! When you draw straws, you\'re supposed to have one of them \'\'short\'\'! That\'s how you decide who loses!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|That\'s not how \'\'I\'\' played it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Uuugh, could we hurry this up? My stomach is growling.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at the hospital.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|I found a map that shows the location of a backup generator. Apparently, they built a large self-sustaining generator- for just this kind of emergency. But it\'s out and away from the hospital.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|So how do we get to it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|We must split up into two teams: Team A, and Team B. Team A will consist of myself, Stan, Kyle, Eric, Chef, and Nurse Goodly. Team B will consist of Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny is stunned. The doctor pats his head.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Now, listen closely, Team B. Your goal will be to turn on the backup generator. To do this you must brave the storm outside and get into this sewage duct.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Dr. Doctor points it out to him on the map.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Meanwhile, Team A will go to the holding area, here \'\'[Points to it.]\'\' where there is a television, and some cocoa. We will drink the cocoa and watch family programming until Team B makes it through the sewage duct. By that time, Team B- remember, that\'s you, Kenny- should reach the outer core of the generator. It will be a cold and dangerous climb to the top, and there could be velociraptors- here.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He points to an area between the holding area and the generator.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Once you reach the top, you should be able to get a clear view from this windows of us drinking cocoa and watching television. Then, you could proceed down into the generator, and power it on. Are there any questions?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Nnoh, that sounds pretty sweet to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Great, then, let\'s do it. Go, Team!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Huh?)}}\n{{ScriptScene|The studio.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|I... can\'t... go on... eh. So... hungry...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|We\'re all going to die in this horrible place. \'\'[She covers her eyes.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|We have to have the energy to make it through the night. We have to eat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Greenfield|How \'\'can\'\' we? How could we \'\'live\'\' with ourselves?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|There\'s only one answer: eat Eric Roberts. \'\'[He\'s shown squatting on the floor.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|\'\'[Thoughtfully.]\'\' Yes, of course. Nobody gives a shit about Eric Roberts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[Madly]\'\' Eat Eric Roberts!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The rest of the group goes mad, Ned gets up and everyone prepares to do him in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Eric Roberts|No! No, please!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Later. Eric\'s arms, legs, and head have been removed, and bees hover around the corpse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Well, there\'s no going back now. \'\'[Ned and Jimbo keep eating.]\'\' We\'re cannibals. \'\'[Someone burps.]\'\' God save us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|God wants you to live, Mayor. Fight!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Assistant|\'\'[Coolly.]\'\' Well I have to admit, Eric Roberts was much juicier than I expected.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Greenfield|\'\'[Miffed.]\'\' Aaww.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|This snow just isn\'t letting up. We\'re gonna \'\'die\'\' here, I \'\'know\'\' it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|What time is it, Barbrady?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|It\'s almost midnight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh! I can\'t... go on. \'\'[Drops to his side.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|We\'ll give the storm another hour. After that, we might have to eat again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Greenfield|What? Christ, are you people diabetic or something?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The hospital. Kenny has made it through the tunnel and exits the manhole. He\'s pretty soiled. He turns on his communicator.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Team B? Come in, Team B.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(This is Team B.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Listen, Team B. We\'ve found another path to the generator. There\'s actually a nice heated walkway to it, so you don\'t need to walk through all that sewage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Are you fuckin\' telling me that I could\'ve fuckin\' gone that way?!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Oh... Well, forget I said that, then. Listen, Team B, you should be seeing a large drift of snow with some metal sticking out of it just to your left.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yup! I see it in the drift.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Good. Head towards it. Team A out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What if Mephesto never wakes up, and I never find out who my father is?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny heads toward the generator and a dinosaur casts its shadow on both of them.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The studio. Ned, Jimbo and the Mayor are eating again. The camera shows that Greenfield and the assistant have joined Eric Roberts as casualties to cannibalism. Barbrady is seen working on a leg and some ribs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|My God, what a harrowing tale of human drama this is. All of us doing what we must to survive.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|It \'\'is\'\' amazing what people can do under stress. Just look at the pyramids. Nobody knows how they built those, or who.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer 1|Who built the pyramids? Was it the [[Babylonians]]? Officer Barbrady? [[Samaritans]]?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The generator. Kenny has opened the door and is ready for new orders.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Okay, I\'ve reached the generator)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Roger, Team B. \'\'[To Team A.]\'\' He\'s reached the backup generator. \'\'[To Kenny.]\'\' Team B, can you see the two copper nodes?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Roger.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Good. Now, is there a wire connecting them?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Negative.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Damn! The wire connecting the nodes is gone! We need to complete the circuit between them, or we\'re screwed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|D\'you have any wire here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|There\'s no time! Once these lights flicker out all the patients on life-support are going to die!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(I\'ll stick \'em together)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|No, Kenny, you can\'t. There must be some other way! He\'s going to make the connection himself, with his hands.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, he\'ll die!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Go, Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Kenny! Nnnoooooo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Goodbbyyyyee-ugh!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my God, they\'ve killed Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You bastard!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The lights stabilize.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|The power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Quickly! Get the scanner running again!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The scanner is brought in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|We\'ve got a chance now!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The White House. Liane has bedded her way up to the President, and she\'s in bed with him now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|President Bill Clinton|Well, okay, Mrs. Cartman, I\'ll legalize 40th trimester abortions for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|\'\'[Relieved and joyful.]\'\' Oh, thank you, \'\'thank\'\' you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinton|We\'ll have the pregnancy terminated immediately. \'\'[Her eyes widen.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|\'\'[Pulls back.]\'\' Terminated?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinton|Why yes, that\'s what an abortion is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh no uh- I didn\'t mean that. I meant the \'\'other\'\' thing you can do-what\'s that other A word?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinton|Adoption?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Yess, that\'s what I mean. Adoption.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinton|Well, that\'s- pretty different.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh, I should tell my son the truth about everything myself. Good day, Mr. President.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She quickly leaves the bed. Now to a Colorado sunrise.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Well, we made it. The power is on, the snow is melting, and your friend Mephesto is doing fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|\'\'[Coming to.]\'\' Where... where am I?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|You\'re at the hospital, Mr. Mephesto. You were shot. Now, we don\'t know who tried to shoot you, but--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Ohh. I\'m sure it was my brother again. He tries to shoot me every month.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Ooohhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Where\'s the little fat boy? He\'ll be delighted that Mephesto\'s awake.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|He went off looking for Mr. Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are at the generator. I guess the raptors have left.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He was a good friend, and I\'ll miss him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He was very brave. He risked his life so that Mephesto could live.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah. And now he\'s a freezy-pop.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny is shown iced over, and the boys simply stare.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[To Kyle.]\'\' Dude! D\'you think if we hit him with a shovel, he\'d shatter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I don\'t know. Let\'s find out.}}\n{{ScriptScene|"Ave Maria" begins to play. Jimbo is the first to shovel his way out of the studio. Mr. Garrison follows, then Ned, then the Mayor, then...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Ohh. It\'s over! We\'re free!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Yes, but at what cost, Mr. Garrison? At what cost?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Listen, everybody. We did what we had to in there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|But- hhhow will we live with ourselves now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Mm-one day at a time, Mayor. Mm-one day at a time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singer|\'\'[A la Aaron Neville]\'\'<poem><i>Ave Maria...</i></poem>\'\'[The camera pulls back, and back...]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well, I\'m bringing home some Eric Roberts in a doggie bag. Does anybody else want some?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The hospital. Mephesto is recuperating, and Kevin is back at his side. All the possible fathers are present, including the Denver Broncos.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|I\'m glad that you could all come. I can finally reveal who the father of Eric Cartman is. But first, I want to thank Kenny McCormick for sacrificing his life--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Just tell us already!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Alright alright. The father of Eric Cartman is... Say, did anybody see that \'\'Terrance and Phillip\'\' special last month? Wasn\'t that just the funniest thing--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Boiling.]\'\' Dammit! Tell me who my father is already!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Oh. As I said before, the father is somebody in this room. The father is... Mrs. Cartman. \'\'[All gasp.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|What???}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|\'\'[Back with her cookies.]\'\' Yes, it\'s true.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Noo, that doesn\'t make sense!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Yes. It took quite a while for me to understand as well. You see, Mrs. Cartman is a hermaphrodite. \'\'[She looks guilty.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Uh-meaning what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Meaning that she has both male and female genitals.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|It\'s true.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|You mean, at the Drunken Barn Dance, when we all got together with her, \'\'she\'\' was a \'\'he\'\'?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|No no, not exactly. But she did have a penis.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned, Barbrady, and Chef vomit. The rest just cup their mouths. Gerald is shocked.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|The fact of the matter is, hermaphrodites cannot bear children, so Mrs. Cartman\'s DNA match with Eric can only mean that she is his father, and she got another woman pregnant at the Drunken Barn Dance.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ugh. Man, this is fuckin\' weak.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude! You\'re a big fatass, \'\'and\'\' your mom\'s a hermapholite!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|I\'m sorry I never told you, Eric.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Eric and Stan look up at her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|I just thought, maybe it would be a little shocking to you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, wow, gee whiz, you think so, Mom?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Well, that\'s that. Thank you all for playing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No no, wait a minute! If... if she\'s my dad, then... who\'s my \'\'mom?!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer 1|Who is Eric Cartman\'s mother? Is it Mrs. Crabtree? Sheila Broflovski? The Mayor?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ooohhh, forget it!}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia02|episode=02}}\n[[zh:卡特曼的妈还是很荡/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Two]]'}]}}}}
