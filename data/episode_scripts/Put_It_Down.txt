Hey guys, and there\'s also gonna be a suicide awareness pot luck at 7:30 tomorrow night in the school gymnasium. We\'re gonna have lots of games and face-painting, and uh, what are you guys gonna have?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Henry|...Uhw-we\'re gonna have some guest speakers and also provide grievance counselors for those who need it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, grievance counseling, that sounds super fun. Listen guys, there\'s a very real chance I might actually do it right in front of everyone tomorrow, so you don\'t want to miss it. Suicide prevention pot luck, everybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[approaches Cartman and takes the mic from Henry]\'\' Eric, you need to stop. What they\'re doing is important.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|They\'re doing a memorial service with speeches and crying. What\'s that gonna solve?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|It\'s not about problem-solving, Eric. It\'s about people getting together and feeling what they need to feel. [Craig\'s jaw drops, as he realizes this is what Tweek was trying to tell him] People need help sorting out their emotions sometimes. And the best thing isn\'t always quick answers, but just being there, supporting each other and... talking through those feelings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You are so up and down. I don\'t know what you want from me, Heidi!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|\'\'[Craig runs off, inspired by Heidi\'s words]\'\' Come on, there has to be a way we can all work together here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So now you\'re on their side!

What do you mean, what\'s going on?! The same shit that\'s been going on!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Nothing\'s gotten any better? Oh my God, how does that make you feel?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|I feel scared! I feel alone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Well that must be horrible to feel that way. It must be hard for you to even think!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|It is! \'\'[gets off the bed and walks up to Craig]\'\' It\'s terrible!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|I bet it\'s terrible! What else are you feeling?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Like, like I have no control over my life. Like I\'m just a pawn in a big game.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Oh, that\'s a terrifying thought. You must feel trapped.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Yeah, like trapped, but like, completely unable to even move.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Jesus, it\'s like there\'s no solution to any of this! What are you gonna do?? What can you do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|I don\'t know, it\'s... it\'s like... maybe, maybe I have to find a way to feel a little in charge of me again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|That sounds so insurmountable though. How would you even start?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|I don\'t know, but I I\'ve gotta do something about this. There\'s gotta be a way I can... \'\'[stops shaking and comes to a realization. He turns to see Craig and smiles. Craig smiles back]\'\' Thank you, Craig. \'\'[turns around and thinks]\'\' I\'ve got it. People aren\'t focused on the right thing. I know what I should do.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school auditorium, evening. The kid\'s parents are now present.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|All right everyone, listen up. Tonight, one of our students has put together a song about a very important issue. It\'s a song about how there are certain times to not be on your phone.
