What\'s that?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Expert 9|I don\'t want to go into too much detail but... you choke yourself with a belt around your neck while masturbating dressed up like Batman or something, then you pass out from lack of air and apparently it makes your orgasm super awesome.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Really??)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh no.
