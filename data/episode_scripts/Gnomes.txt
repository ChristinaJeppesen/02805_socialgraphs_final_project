\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary. The class bell rings and the children are rowdy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[entering]\'\' Settle down, children. I have some difficult news. This is going to make you all very sad. \'\'[the class is now seated]\'\' The school board is considering firing me as your teacher. There\'s a possibility that I will be let go and never allowed to teach you again. \'\'[Stan raises his hand]\'\' Yes, Stanley?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That\'s okay with us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kid|Yeah, we don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, that\'s fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'No it isn\'t, it makes you very sad!\'\' Now, apparently, the school board thinks that I don\'t teach you anything about current events, so tomorrow they\'re going to have you do presentations for the whole board.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Class|Aawwww! \'\'[heads drop]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[writes on the board]\'\' "Current Events in South Park". Now, I want you all to read a newspaper, or better yet, watch television, and come up with something current in South Park to do a report on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Class|Aawwww! \'\'[heads drop. Cartman is certainly vocal about it.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Now, this\'ll be a group project, so I\'m going to place you all into groups of five. Let\'s see, uh. Wendy, Bebe, Clyde, Pip, and Tolkien, you\'ll be Group 1, and Group 2 will be Stan, Kyle, Eric, Kenny, a-and, and Tweek.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|\'\'[disheveled and really tweaked]\'\' AAAghah heheh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[laments]\'\' Oh, not Tweek.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We don\'t \'\'wanna\'\' be in a group with Tweek.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|There\'s nothing wrong with Tweek. I bet he\'ll do a great job in your group.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek Tweak|\'\'I can\'t take that kind of pressure. No, Sweet Jesus, ple-hehease!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, we can\'t work with this kid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Yuh-ugh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|That\'s what Chad Everett thought when the new female intern joined the cast of \'\'Medical Center\'\'. He thought, "Who is this woman with her gazungas and high heels? What does she know about medicine?" Well, that intern soon saved Chad Everett\'s brother with a kidney transplant. So, you see? \'\'[silence]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well, let me put it another way. You have to give your oral report to the entire South Park Town Committee tomorrow. And if it doesn\'t kick ass, and you make me look bad, Mr. Hat is gonna smack you bitches up!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Wagh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, downtown. Off to the right of Tom\'s Rhinoplasty is a coffee store: Tweek Bros. A businessman walks in with briefcase.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard Tweak|Hello there, customer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Customer|Hello. How are you today?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Great. What can I get for you? Large coffee, small coffee? \'\'[motions to the menu]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Customer|I\'m actually interested in something else. I\'m John Postum from the Harbucks Coffee Corporation...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Oh, you\'re that corporate guy who\'s been calling.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|That\'s right. How come \'\'you\'\' don\'t call me back? All we wanna do is buy out your coffee shop here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Oh, forget it, my store is not for sale.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|My company\'s prepared to make you a veerry generous offer. \'\'[lifts the briefcase and opens it. It\'s empty, but he elaborates]\'\' This is a Cramsonite briefcase. All leather, it has four compartments and a keyless lock. Interested?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Uh, I don\'t think so. My coffee shop is worth a lot to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|Well, all right. \'\'[closes the briefcase and lifts up two money bag]\'\' How about $500,000?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|The answer is still no, Mr. Postum. You see, when my father opened this store 30 years ago, he cared about only one thing: making a great cup of coffee. \'\'[moves to his left, towards a backdrop containing lovely rolling hills and a rainbow. A soothing acoustic tune comes up]\'\' Sure, we may take a little longer to brew a cup, and we may not call it fancy names, but I guess we just care a little more. \'\'[a cart of beans rolls up to him]\'\' And that\'s why Tweek Coffee is still home-brewed from the finest beans we can muster. Yes, Tweek Coffee is a simpler cup, for a simpler America.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|Well, that\'s too bad. We\'re just gonna have to open our Harbucks right next door to you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|\'\'[protesting]\'\' But that could put me out of business.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|Hey, this is a capitalist country, pal! Get used to it!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Postum leaves. Officer Barbrady enters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|\'\'[sees Postum leaving]\'\' Hello, Mr. Tweek.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Hi, Officer Barbrady.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|Who was that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Oh, just some dong. What can I get for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|The usual.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Richard pulls out a brown cat from behind the counter and slaps him with it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Barbrady leaves as he closes the door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Bye-bye.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary. The class is now in groups of five. Tweek is still wired.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, we have to do this stupid report, so--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|\'\'[twitching and closing his right eye]\'\' AAAaaagh. Ugh, ugh, huh, aarrrnnn. Aaarrrhaharn.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sooo, let\'s figure out what to do it about.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Shots of Kyle, Kenny, then Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|How about we do it on that Raymond guy on TV, you know, \'\'Everybody Loves Raymond\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[angry]\'\' No, Cartman, we can\'t do it on Raymond again! It has to be on a current event in South Park. Tweek, do you have any ideas?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan gets alarmed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Uuurrnnn, too much pressure!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Great. A lot of help you are, kid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|The gnomes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|\'\'[gritting his teeth]\'\' We can do our report on the gnomes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What gnomes?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|The underpants gnomes. The little guys that, that come into your room late, late at night and steal your underpants.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Shots of Kyle, Stan, then Cartman looking at Tweek.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, so \'\'that\'s\'\' where all my underpants go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, that\'s the dumbest thing I\'ve ever heard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, I\'ve never seen any underpants gnomes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|They come out at 3:30 in the morning. Most people aren\'t up then, but I am. I can\'t sleep. Ever.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, we can\'t do a presentation on underpants gnomes. Mr. Garrison will fail us because you\'re making it up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|No!! Sleep at my house tonight; I\'ll prove it to you.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Tweak house that night. Richard Tweak and his wife are in the kitchen. They have three coffeemakers going on at once. Coffee mugs are everywhere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|They want me to sell the store, and it\'s so much money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Some things are more important than money. \'\'[turns around]\'\' The people of South Park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee every day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|I know, but if they open a Harbucks right next door, we might go out of business. They really have my balls in a vice grip.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tweek and the boys enter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Oh, hello, son. How was your day?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|UUuuUunh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweek|That\'s good. Who are your little friends?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|What do you mean?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re his oral report buddies.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, we have to stay up all night to write it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Well, have some coffee boys. I\'ll brew up another pot for later.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys each take a cup.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Coffee? I don\'t think I like coffee.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Hoh, you\'ll like this coffee. It\'s fresh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|\'\'[waxing prosaic]\'\' Country fresh, like the morning after a rainstorm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'Kay. Maybe it\'ll help us figure out what to do our report on. We have to present it to the entire South Park town committee tomorrow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Oh. I\'ve got one for you. How about doing a report on how large corporations take over little family-owned businesses?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Richard!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|No, I\'m- serious, hon. These boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining America. You see, I own a coffee shop and now a great, big, multi-million dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means I may have to shut down and sell my son Tweek into slavery.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Mwaaah! Slavery?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Yes, slavery.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[to Tweek]\'\' Wow, that sucks, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|They really have my balls in a salad shooter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re already doing a paper on Tweek\'s underpants gnomes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Now, Tweek, how many times do we have to tell you? Your underpants are missing because you \'\'lose\'\' them, not because of underpants gnomes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Uunnnnhh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Come on, you guys! We better get to work!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tweek and the boys leave the kitchen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Wuh-okay, but corporate takeovers is a much more fertile subject.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Honestly, Richard. I don\'t see why you have to preach to some eight-year olds.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Actually, honey, I think those little tykes are just what we need. I\'ve got an idea.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Later that night, in Tweek\'s room, the boys sip their coffee.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'Man\'\', this stuff is strong.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kind of bitter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|\'\'[in a corner of the room, scared]\'\' What if my parents go out of business? Uh what\'ll I do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[going to him]\'\' Don\'t worry about it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|But we\'ll starve and die like dogs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Tweek, Tweek, you can always go on welfare. Look at Kenny\'s family: they\'re perfectly happy being poor and on welfare. Right, Kenny?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Fuck you!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Heheh, you suck, Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, let\'s just try to finish all this coffee, so we can stay up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Still later: 10:08p.m.. The boys are hyperactive.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Aooooo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Woohoo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Let me try! Let me try!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeess, this stuff rocks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Totally, dudes! I feel awesome!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[running]\'\' Whoopee!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny jumps high enough to knock down the bedside lamp. The shade goes to the floor. 10:09 p.m.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[running around the rim of a throw rug like an Olympian]\'\' You guys! You guys! Seriously! I\'m a sorcerer! Zhyagah, zhyah, zhyagot that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey, Tweek, you got anymore of this stuff?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|I just have grounds.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Killer!! \'\'[goes for it and eats it raw]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[rushing up]\'\' Ey, let me have some grounds. \'\'[take some, swallows, and throws up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Gross, Cartman. Whoopee!}}\n{{ScriptScene|10:15 p.m. gives way to 3:26 a.m., which finds the boys sitting against the bed. Tweek is on it, and Cartman is passed out next to the toys, surrounded by pools of vomit. Kenny looks sleepy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hogh, my stomach hurts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, mine too. I wonder why.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[peeved]\'\' Well, it\'s 3:30; I don\'t see any god-damned underpants gnomes, Tweek.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Urgh. Uh maybe, maybe it was all in my head. Maybe I\'m going insane! \'\'Oh no I\'m going insane!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[cross]\'\' Well, this is just great! We haven\'t gotten anything done, and we\'re totally screwed!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|\'\'[checking]\'\' How\'s the report going, boys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Bad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Oh, do you need some more coffee?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|Eugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No...more...coffee. Blech. \'\'[the vomit falls back on him and on the ground]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Well, boys, uh. I don\'t mean to pry, but, if you want it, I wrote your report for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|All|\'\'[suddenly bright]\'\' You did?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Yes, it\'s all about corporate takeovers. Of course, you don\'t \'\'have\'\' to \'\'use\'\' it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[goes with Kyle to get it] No\'\', we\'ll use it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Alright. \'\'[Kyle takes it]\'\' And it can be our little secret about who wrote it, right?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tweek begins to hear some elfin music: "Time to go to work,"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sure. \'\'["work all night"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Now, when you give the report, \'\'[Tweek gasps and points]\'\' just make sure that you read this part first, okay? \'\'[the gnomes open the door and enter:<br>"Search for underpants, hey<br>We won\'t stop until we have underpants<br>Yum tum yummy tum day"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|There they are!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|\'\'[A gnome goes for Tweek\'s bottom drawer, opens it, and takes out some underpants.<br>"Time to go to work, work all night<br>Search for underpants, hey<br>We won\'t stop until we have underpants<br>Yum tum yummy tum day"]\'\'<br>And when you come up to do it a second time, really, really clear it up, I mean, um, really, really play the sympathy angle.

I\'ll have to try and appeal to the younger crowd.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Later. The crowd now marches in front of Harbucks.

I\'m Camel Joe and I love a fresh cup of coffee.

Your coffee tastes like three-day-old moldy diarrhea!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Uh, I\'m sorry to inform you that this town is having a vote tomorrow, and if the law passes, you\'re gonna be thrown out of town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|At five o\'clock, the best coffee wins. Either your coffee, or a fresh, warm cup of... \'\'Tweek\'s\'\' coffee. \'\'[brings out a bag of Tweekers BLEND, then hugs it]\'\' Like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on Tweek\'s coffee to start your day. \'\'[turns and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor|\'\'[arriving with her aides]\'\' Tomorrow, for the Prop. 10 vote, we\'ll set up ballot booths... here. \'\'[between the two coffee shops]\'\' All right, men, we\'ll throw up the stage here. Before the vote we\'ll get a band \'\'every\'\'one likes, like uhhhh, like...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnson|Toto.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor|Like Toto.

I\'m to blame for all this! I\'m to blame for everything!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tweek\'s house that night, Tweek\'s room.

Whoo, Toto! Woo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lady Member|All right. And now, before we all vote yes on Prop. 10, here to remind us why are the lovable, innocent children.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh. Since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends, the underpants gnomes, and they told us all about big corporations.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Supporter|Underpants gnomes?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Big corporations are good!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Supporter|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Supporter 2|What\'s this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Supporter 3|Good? \'\'[the Lady Member is cross]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Because without big corporations we wouldn\'t have things like cars and computers and canned soup.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Even Harbucks Coffee started off as a small, little business. But because it made such great coffee, and because they ran their business so well, they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today.

Well, the truth is, we didn\'t write that paper last time.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Gasps from the crowd.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|You little turds!!

Mrs. Tweek claps for the boys and goes onstage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|These boys are absolutely right. We\'ve been using these poor kids to pull at your heartstrings for our cause, and it\'s wrong. We\'re as low and despicable as Rob Reiner.

The crowd blinks]\'\' Harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best. Don\'t you think you should at least try it?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd parts as Postum exits Harbucks with a tray of his coffee, then closes in to get the coffee.

Hey, that \'\'is\'\' good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|It\'s a French roast.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|It\'s subtle and mild. Mild, like that first splash of sun on an April  morning. This coffee is coffee the way it should be.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Postum|Hehey, no hard feelings, Tweek. You know, we still need someone to run this Harbucks coffeehouse. I\'m sure it will make a \'\'lot\'\' of money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Thank you, Mr. Postum, but I think we\'ll be happy with the money we make selling our son into slavery.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|Aggghhh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Just kidding, son.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Everyone laughs.
