Randy walks up to the plate-glass window with a chair and smashes the chair through it. Jimbo walks into Tele\'s first and everyone else follows. Jimbo turns on a TV and everyone else gathers to see the news. Onscreen, the small floating window says "This page cannot be displayed." At the bottom of the screen is a crawl that reads "THERE IS NO INTERNET"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchorman|Once again we apologize, but we cannot bring you the news.

Next scene is a shot of the Marsh house, eight days without Internet. Tumbleweeds begin to roll in. Inside, no one is doing much.

Randy begins to cough}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|What\'s the matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I don\'t know. I need to get on Web MD and see why I have this cough, but I can\'t. \'\'[coughs]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|What if my sweetheart is online looking for me? He could be wondering why I don\'t get online with him. Maybe he thinks I\'m dead. \'\'[looks at Stan]\'\' If my darling Amir gets another Internet girlfriend, I\'m gonna kill him!

The Marshes have packed and weighed their car down with everything they can load up on it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Randy, where will you go?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|We\'re gonna head west. There\'s a rumor goin\' around there might be some Internet out there. So we\'re headed out Californee Way.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|You don\'t know if there\'s any Internet in California.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well there certainly ain\'t none here! Look, maybe it\'s time you all face reality! The Internet here is dried up!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|It could come back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, and maybe it won\'t!

You won\'t have Internet. \'\'[starts the car and moves out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|En route to California. Randy takes the Mother Road, Route 66, all the way there.

They stop at a Canyon Motel - which has no Internet}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Motel Clerk|\'\'[fanning himself]\'\' Sorry folks, we\'re full up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Know anywhere else we can stay?

"Get online" he says.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[annoyed]\'\' What\'s so funny about that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Transient Man 5|Think about it. How many folk headin\' out to Californee? A million? More?

Let\'s do it! \'\'[Kyle walks forward, then up the ramp. His parents fear for him. He walks up and to the right, sees the massive plug and walks to the socket.
