The Vietnam War was sticky and icky.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle raises his hand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Mr. Garrison, were you in Vietnam?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison frowns as he seems to recall an incident in that war.

The boys come to see the taping.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo| One of our loyal viewers from South Park sent us some 8mm film of what \'\'he\'\' claims to be the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka. Now, as you all know, the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka can supposedly kill you with one horrid gaze. If a person even so much as looks into the frog\'s eyes, they can be paralyzed, or even die. And this film proves that that frog may very well exist.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The film plays.

What kind of stupid-ass question is that?! Of course it was fun!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Well, sure, Vietnam was fun. But not like goin-to-the-circus fun, or fly-fishin-in-Montana fun.

All it said was that they saw the Mexican staring frog just south of Stark\'s Pond this morning.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hey, Ned. Remember that time when we got the anonymous tip back in \'Nam?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|You were in \'Nam? Where were you stationed?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Mmm-Da Nang.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cameraman|With the log ride?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Yep.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|Man, I was in Tet. We had a bad-ass roller coaster, but... all we ever wanted was a log ride. We waited and we waited, but... they never built us one. I think..Danforth wanted the log ride more than anybody, but he... he had to settle with that lame dinosaur water adventure ride.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|That war was hell on everybody.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tom starts sobbing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Good. Okay. Okay, bye! Good news, everybody. This week\'s ratings are through the roof! We\'re up to twenty people!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Wow! Do we got more money?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|No, but I do. We\'re now the highest-rated show on Mountain Cable Access! God bless the Mexican staring frog!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys are back in the woods, and their frog is on a small boulder.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, they\'re gonna look so stupid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, totally.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|They deserve it for lying to us, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Relishing the moment.]\'\' Revenge is so very, very sweet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|They\'re here! Hurry and hide!}}\n{{ScriptScene|They run for cover in a patch of shrubs. Jimbo stops his hummer and the men get out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Let\'s hunt!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|We\'ll start with a two-shot of you and Ned getting your equipment together and--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Mm-Jimbo, look!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hit the deck!}}\n{{ScriptScene|They hide behind a snow drift.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|What is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|It\'s him! The Mexican staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka. He\'s right over there on that rock.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|He is?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Dumb-ass! You\'ve got to keep your eyes away from him!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The producer tries to sneak a peek, but Jimbo forces him down again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Stay down. Ned, you take flight position; I\'ll try and keep it turned away from you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Mm-roger that.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned leaves the drift, as Jimbo stands, facing the camera.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hello, fellow hunters. Have we got a show for you today.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned moves behind the cameraman and begins his assault.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|The Mexican staring frog is sunning itself on a rock directly behind us.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned jumps from behind one tree to behind another.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo| We\'ve got to take the frog by surprise. I\'m gonna create a diversion using this incendiary device, while Ned will ambush him from the rear.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo pulls the pin out and throws the grenade behind him. It hits the rock, but the plastic frog simply went about face.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Now, Ned! He\'s not looking!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned advances quickly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Quick, Ned, hit him with the shotgun! Now, Ned!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Silence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Ned. Ne-ed?}}\n{{ScriptScene|He turns around and draws closer to the rock. He sees Ned, now catatonic, looking at the frog.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Oh, no!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Close-up. Ned\'s hair stands on end.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Come on, Ned, buddy, snap out of it!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned\'s gun drops from his good arm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Come back to me, buddy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|You getting all this?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The cameraman smiles and gives a thumbs up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hold onto your butts.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo fires away at the frog with his shotgun.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Take that, you demon frog!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo rushes up to Ned.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Ned, Ned? Can you hear me?}}\n{{ScriptScene|He turns to his crew.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Quick! Somebody, call an ambulance! This man is catatonic!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Get the Flight for Life helicopter!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys rise out of the shrubs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Holy crap, dude.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hells Pass Hospital. Jimbo is at Ned\'s bedside reading to him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|..."but Ponyboy was beat up pretty bad. He kept saying, \'stay gold.\'"}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo closes the book and watches Ned.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Aw, Ned. If you can hear me, y-you\'ve \'\'got\'\' to snap out of it, \'cause if you don\'t, uh-I\'ll never forgive myself.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys enter the room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Aw, Stanley, he\'s gone! My only friend in the world is gone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, he\'s okay. That frog wasn\'t even real!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Look!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle holds up the plastic frog, which puts Jimbo on guard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Aghh! What the hell are you doing? I almost looked right at it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, it\'s just a plastic frog; it\'s not real. Check it out!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo drops his guard and inspects the frog.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|What..?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We shot all those videos and sent them in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, we made the whole thing up. It was all just a really, really funny joke! \'\'[Grins.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|\'\'You sent in those videos?!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|\'\'[On the phone.]\'\' Oh, this is not good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|My best friend is a vegetable, and I\'m gonna be the laughingstock of South Park!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Aw, come on. Ned\'s faking it. That frog was just a piece of \'\'plastic!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. Come on, Ned. Quit fakin\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|No response from Ned.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|You boys don\'t understand. Ned was so freaked out by the idea of the Mexican staring frog that he must have sent himself into a deep coma.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus\' producer is suddenly at the doorway with a satellite listening device.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus\' producer|It\'s a psychosomatic response. \'\'[Entering.]\'\' I couldn\'t help overhearing your conversation just now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Who are you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus\' producer|I produce a little TV show called \'\'Jesus and Pals\'\', you might have heard of it. Your story is amazing; full of jealousy, duplicity, backstabbing and bitterness.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Uhhhh... Thanks?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus\' producer|How would you like to share your remarkable story with us on tomorrow\'s show?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus and Pals, after a commercial break. Today\'s topic: Tots in Trouble.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|We\'re back with Jimbo and his nephew, Stan. These kids can\'t stop lying, can\'t they?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|That\'s right, Jesus. No respect for their elders. As some of you may know, I host a local show on hunting.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A woman claps.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Thanks. We\'ve been hunting the Mexican staring frog for a week based on some video footage we received from a viewer. Well, it turns out that these kids faked the footage!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Is that true, Stan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It was just a joke; we didn\'t think it would hurt anybody.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus looks over to see his producer signaling him to call for a break.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Uhh, we\'ll find out more about this \'\'debauchery\'\' when we return.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cameraman|A-and we\'re out.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus walks off the stage, as the producer walks on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|You\'re \'\'corpses\'\' out here! We need a lot more action from everybody!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Like what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Like, go ahead and tell how your nephew Stan takes drugs and worships Satan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Satan. Got it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whoa, I don\'t take drugs and worship Satan! That\'s lying!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Give you a taste of your own medicine, you little fibber!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|And you kids! I didn\'t bring you on this show to be boring. Somebody get pissed off and throw a chair at Ned here.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman raises his hand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dibs!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Remember, you all start to fight \'\'after\'\' the chair is thrown. That\'s your cue.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Roger.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The theme music plays again and the crowd applauds for the next segment. Action.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Welcome back to \'\'Jesus and Pals\'\'. Jimbo, why do you think little Stanley lies?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|I\'ll tell you why. Because he\'s on drugs and worships the devil!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience and Stan gasp.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Audience|Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Wow. Now, Stanley, it sound like your uncle is really worried about you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I only..did it \'cause... he..molested me.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus\' jaw drops. The audience boos, and the sound man and the director high-five each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Why, you little piece of crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You big piece of crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s it! Now I\'m all pissed off!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman takes his chair and throws it at Ned.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Take that, hippie!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The chair hits Ned, who continues to just sit there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hey! }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Audience|Jeesus! Jeesus!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo picks up his chair and throws it at Cartman. The chair hits a woman in the right side of her head in the audience and she gets up angry. She heads for the stage.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus tries to calm things down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|O-okay, okay, that\'s enough.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|woman|\'\'[Slugs Jimbo.]\'\' Take that, you asshole!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo falls. She jumps on him and strikes again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|woman|What the fuck was that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Uh, let\'s watch the language, people.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Bring it on, you bitch!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She hits him again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ey, get off of him, you fuckin\' nutsack!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Audience|Jeesus! Jeesus! Jeesus!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A blond man pushes Jesus out of the way as he heads for the stage. The rest of the audience follow suit, and soon everyone is fighting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Let\'s all just..make our way back to our seats.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny is being pulled apart by two men.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Nononono-yikes!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|A man in a green shirt hits Kenny in the face with a chair.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny is ripped in half.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man in green shirt pulling Kenny|Yeah, yeah, yeh... \'\'[Gasps.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man in blue shirt pulling Kenny|Yeah, yeah, yeh-oh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man with chair hitting Kenny|Oh, Oh! Aah! AAAAGGHH!!! \'\'[Gasps.]\'\' Ooh.. Ew \'\'[Shrieks.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny begins crying.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[Sobbing.]\'\' (OW! OW! DUDE, PLEASE STOP!! OH, FUCK! YIKES!!!!!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|The 3 men, Stan, & Kyle gasp in horror to see what happened.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, my God! They\'ve killed Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You bastards!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman comes flying across the stage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ey, you guys!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Two men just sitting in the audience start to fight for no reason.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Let\'s all just..make our way back to our seats.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|woman|Oh, my God!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A man walks by with a chainsaw.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Shut the fuck up!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience members stop and gasp at him. Cartman was biting at the leg of a man onstage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Jesus, what is wrong with you people?! Look around you, Stanley. Look at all the pain and suffering your lie has caused.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience members slowly return to their seats.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|W-we only did it because Jimbo lied to us first. We had this report on the Vietnam War for school, and we interviewed Jimbo about it and he made up all this stuff about Vietnam, and he got us in trouble.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A couple of rats come by and drag Kenny\'s upper half away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hey, now. Everything I told you boys about the war actually happened.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mr. Garrison said that there was no way that you could have defeated the entire Vietcong Army by yourself.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|The \'\'entire\'\' Vietcong Army?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|I uh... Well, okay, I might have em\'\'bellished\'\' the truth a little, but that\'s different.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Well, sure. I mean, eh... \'\'[Pinned.]\'\' Well, no uh, I guess not.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|And as for you, Stan uh, I think you need to kick your drug habit and--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wait a second, I don\'t take drugs! That was a lie!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Wait. Jimbo made that up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, your producer did.}}\n{{ScriptScene|This gets the producer\'s attention.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|She made Jimbo tell everybody that I did drugs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|During the break. Your producer came over, and told Jimbo what to say about me. She told him to lie!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|It\'s true, she did. Hu-I\'m such a tool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Oh, really?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The producer is now trying to hide behind a potted plant.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah! Then she told us to throw a chair at Ned!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah. I didn\'t \'\'wanna\'\' do it, Jesus. They \'\'made\'\' me do that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man in Brown Shirt|Screw this show. I thought this was all real.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience members begin to leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|W-wait, everybody. Come back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Jackson fan|\'\'[Pats Jesus on the shoulder.]\'\' Don\'t feel too bad, Montel. We all want to touch children sometimes; it\'s only natural.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Public Access, outside. Later...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|I\'m sorry, Stan. I was just trying to tell a good story. I never meant for you boys to get in trouble.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|W-we\'re sorry, too, Uncle Jimbo. We\'re sorry for making you look stupid in front of the whole world.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. And we\'re sorry for turning Ned into a vegetable.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Aw, he\'ll be fine. I\'ll just take him home and show him some good hard-core porn, he\'ll snap right out of it. Won\'t you, Ned?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo slaps him on the shoulder, and Ned falls like a statue. A door opens.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|I want to apologize to all of you for what happened in there. In our competition for ratings we lost sight of why we got into show business in the first place.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Yeah. Titties and beer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Actually, I was referring more to the pursuit of truth, but—Well, anyway, I can\'t wait to get back to my old show without all the glitz and the ratings and producers and--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wait a sec. Where \'\'is\'\' your producer?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|\'\'[Upset.]\'\' I sent her away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sent her away where?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell. She enters Satan\'s lair with phone in hand. Pitchforks rise and begin poking her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|What is this? \'\'What\'s happening?!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Welcome to my dominion.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|\'\'[Retreating.]\'\' Oooooohhhh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam Hussein|\'\'[Comes up behind Satan and stands next to him.]\'\' Hey. Take a load off. Put your feet up. Me and Satan were just aboot to go shopping for furniture. Come on, Satan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Okay, honey.}}\n{{ScriptScene|They turn around and walk away, the camera enters her mouth as she screams.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Noooooo!}}\n{{ScriptScene|<poem><i>End of \'\'\'The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka\'\'\'.\nWar is hell\nMy brother\'s a dirty mess\nIn war, war is hell\nIt\'s hell for you and me\n</i></poem>}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia02|episode=06}}\n[[zh:墨西哥杀人蛙/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Two]]'}]}}}}
