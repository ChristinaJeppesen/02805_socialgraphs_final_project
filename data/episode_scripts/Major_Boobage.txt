Tha, that was probably bad.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, day. The original four boys are there, gathered around the coffee table on which stands a frame holding a cat in a harness. Cartman is almost done with the cat}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right, this should keep my cat in place while he sprays the urine. \'\'[Mr. Kitty meows]\'\' Yesss, poor Mr. Kitty, are you just so upset right now? \'\'[Mr. Kitty meows]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You guys are wasting your time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, this is not gonna work.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, ready Kenny?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(All set.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right, bring out...!

His mind is elsewhere...]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny\'s eyes are unfocused as his mind goes into an altered state. He seems to be going through space, then an acid trip, then both. Kenny descends into a Thunderbird fitted with rocket boosters and takes the wheel. He heads towards a desert planet and lands with a thud. He quickly shifts gears and peels away. He drives through the desert landscape until a curvaceous woman steps into his path. He stops. She wears a stylized cowboy hat and skimpy clothes. Kenny motions over and lets her take the wheel. Kenny can\'t help but look at her breasts. They head towards a huge building with breast-shaped touches all overs. The woman steps out and walks towards the stairs, then enters the building. Kenny quickly follows suit. As they walk through the building a creature stabs another one through the skull, killing him}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Hey cool!

Three agents comb the living room}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Look, I told you, I had a cat. But I had it put to sleep \'cause it pissed me off. \'\'[the agents soon leave, and Cartman walks up to the dim attic with a small book]\'\' Shh.

He\'s back in the alternate world, this time riding a giant bird, but the landscape is the same - breast shapes are everywhere. Kenny sees the large-breasted woman from his first trip, but now she\'s strapped onto a rack and is being whipped by three burly men. These men are mutants with four breasts instead of two, and two more breasts on their shoulders. Kenny lands and hops off the bird, finds a metal spear nearby, and launches it. It strikes the middle mutant man through the neck and out the sternum, killing him. The other two run away. Kenny runs to the woman, and she smiles at him. They both ride on the giant bird, with the woman\'s boobs resting on Kenny\'s head}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Woohoohoo! Woooohoooo! Woooohoohoo!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny\'s house.

Will you guys just back the fuck off?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Look at yourself! You\'ve got to lay off the cheese! \'\'[abruptly, Kenny vomits, stops, then vomits again.
