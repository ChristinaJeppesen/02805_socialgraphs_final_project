Will you just give this guy something, please?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Swiss delegate|Excuse me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[Mr. Abootman leans on the door, crying]\'\' He just doesn\'t wanna look like an idiot, so he wants everyone to think the strike was for something. Just, just give him anything!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|French delegate|Well, we could give Canada some small consolation prize}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|If they give you something small, will you end the strike?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|Will they... act like they\'re giving Canada a lot so everyone thinks I did a good job?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Can you act like you\'re giving him a lot?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Swiss delegate|Sure, why not?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Canada, moments later. Mr. Abootman steps outside to the podium and makes an announcement}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|We have won! \'\'[no one reacts: they\'re all too tired to]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lumberjack|Well how much did we get?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|Well, we uh, we didn\'t get everything that we wanted, but... we negotiated hard and... we got these... \'\'[holds up some coupons]\'\' coupons to Bennigan\'s! And... \'\'[holds up a bag of sweets]\'\' free bubblegum... for every Canadian. \'\'[his aide steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands]\'\' These coupons entitle every Canadian to a free meal at Bennigan\'s. With the purchase of a meal at equal or greater value, of course.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide 1|We did it! \'\'[aide 2 steps forward and claps really fast. Other Canadians begin to clap their hands]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|My friends. This is the greatest victory in Canadian history. \'\'[headlines follow: The Canuck Reporter has "Canada Wins The Strike". Canadiety has "Strike over! Canada Victorious!".

A taxi pulls up to the curb and lets the boys out}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ike. Ike! \'\'[Ike wakes up]\'\' It\'s over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|\'\'[stands up]\'\' It\'s over?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. Here you go. \'\'[hands him a Bennigan\'s coupon and a gumdrop. Kyle and the others head indoors]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Boy, I\'m sure glad that\'s over with.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Me too!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, but you know, I learned something today. We thought we could make money on the Internet. But, while the Internet is new and exciting for creative people, it hasn\'t matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue. It will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the Internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Canada, the Victory Party. Kool & The Gang\'s "Celebration". Everyone is just standing around. The camera pans from left to right. Mr. Abootman and his aides appear. They\'re all dancing}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|Yeah, we did it! Celebrate, everyone! Woohoo! \'\'[the reason for everyone standing around is shown: a memorial wall on one side of the room has pictures of everyone who died during the strike. Mourners walk up with bouquets and drop them off at the table in front of the wall.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Hold on a minute! Wait just a second! \'\'[the music stops as Terrance holds out a calculator]\'\' We just did some calculating! By NOT working during the strike, Canadians lost more than 10.4 million dollars!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|And our Bennigan\'s coupons and bubble gum is worth roughly... three thousand and eight dollars!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|Don\'t look at that. Come on, friends, let\'s dance.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|You had no idea what you were doing and now you\'re trying to make it look like you won so that we won\'t set you adrift!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|Damn it friends, don\'t you see? We won for future Canadians, guy. So the little guy doesn\'t get pushed around anymore. This was a victory for Canada\'s respect. \'\'[Terrance and Phillip don\'t believe what they\'re hearing]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The shore of a lake. A man picks away at a block of ice. Two other men come and push it away. On it are Stephen Abootman and his aides}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|Eh?! What do you think you\'re doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|We\'re setting you adrift, idiot!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Maybe you can go live with the Danish!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|You\'ll regret this day, friend!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|I\'m not your friend, buddih!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|I\'m not your buddih, guy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|He\'s not your guy, friend!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|\'\'[loud and drawn out]\'\' I\'m not your friend, buddih!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance & Phillip|We\'re not your buddih, guy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen Abootman|\'\'[now far away]\'\' I\'m not your guy, friend!}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia12|episode=04}}\n[[zh:加拿大罢工/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Twelve]]'}]}}}}
