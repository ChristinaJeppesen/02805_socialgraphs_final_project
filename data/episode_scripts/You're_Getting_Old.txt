I\'m not an old fuddy-duddy, Sharon. I\'m still cool. \'\'[walks out and towards his den.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The den. Randy pops the CD into the CD drive on his computer, puts on his headphones, and listens.

NO I mean... \'\'[looks at Sharon]\'\' I like it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Oh come on!

Um, Kyle, can I talk to you alone for a second?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sure. \'\'[they walk off to a small clearing]\'\' What\'s up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle, I have to admit something to you. You know how I told you over the phone I like the new Gersploosh album? I lied. I don\'t like it. I don\'t like it at all, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh. Really? Um well that\'s okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, you don\'t understand dude. Something\'s happened. Tween Wave doesn\'t sound the same to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Why? What\'s it sound like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It... kind of sounds like shit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What? You mean like you don\'t like the singing, or the lyrics, or what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No. I mean it sounds like somebody is shitting in my ears.

Dude, maybe you should see a doctor.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A doctor\'s office, day. Stan took Kyle\'s advice. A doctor is checking Stan\'s ears}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|And so then I put on exactly the same album that I really like a year ago, and it sounded like shit to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|Uh huh, and what about food? Are some of the things you thought tasted good tasting like shit to you now, too?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. I used to love these Pop Rock things, and I tried them the other day and I thought they tasted like shit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|\'\'[reads his medical file]\'\' This says you had a birthday recently?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I just turned 10.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|Well, that makes sense. You see Stan, as you get older, your eardrums, taste buds, all that stuff develops and changes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So this is normal?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|It\'s very normal. Let\'s just do a quick ear exam. I\'m gonna play some Tween Wave music and you tell me what you hear. \'\'[plays some music, with lots of fart sounds]\'\' What\'s that sound like to you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sounds like shit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|Aha. Now I\'m going to play you some good ole Bob Dylan. \'\'[plays a Dylan track. Dylan gets through three syllables before fart sounds replace him.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh that sounds like shit too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|Wait, this sounds like shit to you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah dude, it\'s just shit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Caroll|Well that\'s very strange. \'\'[turns off the player]\'\' Hm, I\'m gonna try somethin\' else. \'\'[takes two pictures up to Stan]\'\' Look at these two pictures.

I think I know what this is. You see Stan, as you get older, things that you used to like start looking and sounding like shit. And things that seemed shitty as a child don\'t seem as shitty. With you, somehow, the wires have gotten crossed and everything looks and sounds like shit to you. It\'s a condition called "being a cynical asshole."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh no.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor  Caroll|Yes. And there\'s no known cure, I\'m afraid. Everything just seems shitty, and everyone starts to seem shitty, and everything they say just starts to \'\'[sounds shitty now, and Stan can\'t believe his ears.

How much longer can we keep doing this? It\'s like, the same shit just happens over and over and, then in a week it just all resets until- it happens again.

Kyle walks up to Stan, but keeps some distance from him, then turns around and walks away. Stan looks at a flower... which has a huge turd growing from it. A bee lands on it. At the house, Shelly and Sharon pack away everything in the kitchen. Later, Randy explains things to Stan as Stan\'s dresser is being moved. Later, a realtor sets a "FOR SALE" sign in place - four bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, back yard. She finishes and walks away. Randy is driving a U-Haul truck and watches the house fade in the distance through the driver\'s rear-view mirror. Sharon and her kids move into a new place. Sharon works on her room and gives Stan the box for his room. Stan later sits in a swing in the new yard. A small sandlot is nearby. Instead of a wooden fence, the new place has a wrought-iron fence. Stan looks up at the sun, which is a glowing massive turd. Stan is then seen at the cafeteria sitting at a table with a bunch of turds that are supposed to be his classmates. All the food looks like shit too. At night the police arrest the Britches Bandits, the two men who stole Randy\'s underwear, and take the underwear in for evidence. Cartman and Kyle play a game on Kyle\'s sofa. They look at each other and seem to reach a mutual understanding, since they smile at each other. Stan walks all alone in South Park and passes a duck in a tux. He stops and looks at the duck, who keeps walking. It looks at him and quacks out shit, which lands on him. The last scene is Stan lying in his new bed, in his new bedroom, looking up at the ceiling.}}\n}}\n\n{{Episodemedia15|episode=07}}\n[[zh:当你老了/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Fifteen]]'}]}}}}
