\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. The school bell rings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay, kids, as your counselor, I know it can sometimes be difficult to talk about subjects like drugs and sex and alcohol, m\'kay? So, as you remember, last week I told you to write down any difficult questions you had and put them in this box anonymously so we could discuss those questions in class, m\'kay? I got a lot o\' responses, so let\'s read some aloud. \'\'[pulls out the first letter and reads]\'\' "Mr. Mackey is gay." \'\'[some of the kids laugh]\'\' Okay kids, that is not funny! M\'kay?! This box is supposed to be used for serious questions! About, about serious issues! M\'kay, let\'s, let\'s stop the tomfoolery. \'\'[puts it aside and reaches into the box for the next letter]\'\' M\'kay, this looks like a real one here. \'\'[reads]\'\' "Dear Mr. Mackey, you are gay." \'\'[the class laughs]\'\' All right, all right. That\'s enough, kids. Let\'s quiet down and try to be mature, \'kay? \'\'[reaches in to read the next one]\'\' Uh here we go. Okay, "Mr. Mackey, sometimes my parents hit me, and you are gay." \'\'[the class laughs harder]\'\' Dammit, is there not one serious question in here?! \'\'[reads the next two letters]\'\' "Mr. Mackey is gay." "Mr. Mackey is gay." \'\'[gets the next letter]\'\' Okay, here. \'\'[reads]\'\' "I am a boy at South Park Elementary. Sometimes, when I\'m sitting in class, my penis becomes hard for no reason. What should I do?" \'\'[Jimmy looks around nervously. Cartman cracks up, and the rest of the class, except Jimmy, follows]\'\' All right kids, all right kids, that\'s enough! \'\'[a small bell is heard and Jimmy looks down]\'\' If you all can\'t be serious about the question box, \'\'[turns and writes "drugs" on the board]\'\' then we\'ll just do drug identification exercises, unkay?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Class|Awwwww!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay, uhh, Jimmy, why don\'t you come up here and write down the names of two narcotics?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Uh no, that-that\'s okay, Mr. Mackey.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Jimmy, I\'m not asking you, I\'m telling you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Uhhh, just uh ahh not right this second, Mr. Mackey.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well why the hell not?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Uh... \'\'[waves him over. Mr. Mackey walks over and bends down to listen to Jimmy whisper in his ear]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|It\'s what... Oh, you do? R-right now, right now it is? M\'kay, m\'kay. Don\'t worry, Jimmy. \'\'[returns to the board]\'\' N\'kay, uhhh, let\'s pick someone else. Um, Eric, why don\'t you come up here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey, that\'s bullcrap! How come Jimmy doesn\'t have to do it?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well, because uh, Jimmy is pitching a tent right now. \'\'[Jimmy shows some alarm]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s what?? \'\'[Kyle shrugs]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary hallway.

Jimmy always wins with his stand-up comedy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Hey fellas.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, didja see, Jimmy? They\'re giving away a hundred-dollar first prize for the talent show.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Oh I sure have. I\'ve been working on my ruh... ruh... routine all year long.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I don\'t know how you do it, dude. How do you get up in front of that many people?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well fellas, entertainment is my life. I love being in front of everyone. \'\'[his penis gets aroused]\'\' Aaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Huh wuh, what\'s the matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|I gotta guh, I gotta go! See ya fellas. \'\'[rushes away and down the hall]\'\' Eh, excuse me! Evuh evuh - excuh, cuh, cuse me! Excuse me, puh-please. \'\'[he grunts as he heads for the boys\' room and enters, looking for an empty stall. He tries the first toilet stall]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|It\'s occupied. \'\'[Jimmy tries the second stall]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No room at the inn, Virgin Mary. \'\'[Jimmy heads back to the sinks and throws water on his face, then throws water on his pants\' crotch]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[enters and heads for the urinal]\'\' Hehey Jimmy! \'\'[arrives at the urinal, drops his trousers and lifts his shirt, and starts pissing]\'\' M\'boy, did you see that first prize for the talent show? Why you must be excited! You\'ll probably win like always.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Yeah. Yeah, I\'m real excited. REAL excited... for some reason... Oh, Jesus! What\'s wrong with me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[notices some heavy drops in the stalls]\'\' Hey, who\'s droppin\' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Up yours, Butters.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimmy\'s house, afternoon. Jimmy walks through the door and sighs. His parents are on the sofa. His mom reads a book, his dad a newspaper.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sarah|Hey Jimmy, how was school?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Fine, Mom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Jimmy, we understand you\'re getting erections in the classroom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[stops in his tracks for a few seconds, then looks over his shoulder]\'\' What? Uh who told you that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Mr. Mackey, your counselor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Aw J-j-j-j...j-Jesus!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Now, Jimmy, it\'s nothing to be ashamed of. But we know it\'s something you might have a hard time talking about. Get it? A hard time. So, we took your counselor\'s advice \'nd called Doctor Pal to help us all talk about this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Dz-n-Doctor Pal?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|\'\'[springs up from behind the sofa and quite eager to start. He talks quickly]\'\' Hey Jimmy, I\'m Doctor Pal. That\'s because I\'m a doctor, but I\'m also your pal. Are we cool?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Uh, sure?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|A lot of times parents call me in because I can relate to younger kids. I\'m, I\'m down, I\'m dope, you dig? Now, I understand you have some concerns about erections. \'\'[affects a joking manner]\'\' "Oops, can\'t say erection in front of the parents right. Oh God, I feel so weird" huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, a little, yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|Jimmy, there\'s nothing weird about random erections. Almost every boy goes through a phase where his penis becomes hard... for no particular reason. It\'s just part of growing up. Growing up? Growing out is more like it. \'\'[laughs at his own cleverness]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|But I have to make it stop! The talent show is this F-Friday.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|Tell you what, Mom and Dad, why don\'t you skedaddle for a tick and let us hipsters talk in privo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|A-all right, come on, honey. \'\'[they rise and leave the living room]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|Jimmy, as you get older your body goes through a lot of changes. Certain hormones start to release as your whole reproductive system begins to awaken, and so, if you like, we can take off our shirts and kiss.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Ke...c-come again?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|Oh, hey, nothin\', you see? See, that set you off on a different tangent, got you thinkin\' a different way. That\'s what Doctor Pal is here to do. \'\'[leans forward a little]\'\' Unless, of course, you think we \'\'should\'\' take off our shirts and kiss.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|N-no, I do NOT want to take off my shirt and kiss!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor Pal|Well then to hell with you, kid. You can just deal with your problems on your own. \'\'[walks out the door and closes it behind him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimmy\'s house, night. He\'s fast asleep, and we see his dream.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Next up for the talent show, put your hands together for the incredibly talented Jimmy Valmer! \'\'[he approaches the mic. On one side is a stool with a glass of water on it. The school audience is cheering]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow, what a what a great audience. So apparently Martha Stewart is out of jail. Have you have you heard about this, have you seen this? She\'s very excited to get started on her new show, "Martha Stewart Living, with an electronic ankle bracelet." \'\'[the audience laughs heartily]\'\' So it looks like the Vatican has finally chosen a new Pope. Have you seen this, have you heard about this? \'\'[his penis is around and his erection begins to show]\'\' A-a-apparently they\'re going to call him New Pope, a-and refer to John Paul as P-Pope Classic. \'\'[the claps are few, his erection is bigger]\'\' Uh,.. so it so it looks like Michael Jackson is having back problem in court. \'\'[the kids begin to notice the erection and whisper to each other. Jimmy\'s beginning to falter]\'\' You know... huh... you uh you know what they say about b-b-b-b-back problems. \'\'[a girl screams and runs out of the gym. The other kids follow. Jimmy\'s penis has gotten so big it blocks his view of the audience. He moves it to his left so he can see everyone on his right]\'\' Uh, uh gee, what a terrific audience. \'\'[swings it to his right to see everyone on his left]\'\' What a fantastic audience.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Garrison|Don\'t worry, Jimmy. We\'re not laughing with you, we\'re laughing AT you. \'\'[several shots of the audience laughing at Jimmy. Jimmy wakes up and sits up on his bed.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Nuh uh! Wuh. Huh. Waaagh! Ungh! \'\'[punches his genitals with both his fists, then collapses from the resulting pain]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, day. He\'s practicing his favorite song in the garage with some help from his boom box. Jimmy approaches.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'Lu Lu Lu, I\'ve got some apples, Lu Lu Lu, you\'ve got some too. Lu Lu Lu, let\'s get together, I know what we can do, Lu Lu.\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh! Oh hey, Jimmy. \'\'[turns off the tape player]\'\' I\'m just practicin\' for the talent show.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Butters, ah I really need to talk to somebody, and I think maybe you\'re the only person who won\'t make f-f-fun of me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh gosh, I\'d never make fun of somebody with a problem.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Butters, do you know what you\'re supposed to do when your penis gets hard?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[thinks a moment]\'\' Well sure I do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Really??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yes, now sit down, Jimmy, we should have a little talk. \'\'[they sit next to the boom box]\'\' You see, Jimmy, when a man\'s penis becomes hard, the man puts it into a lady. Into her "vagiiina." \'\'[fans his fingers out]\'\' Then, the hard penis sneezes milk inside the lady\'s tummy, and after it\'s all done sneezin\' milk, the penis stops bein\' hard, and the man loses interest in the lady.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|So, when your penis becomes hard, you\'re supposed to put it in a lady\'s vagina. And then it stops being hard?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That\'s right, Jimmy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|But where am I going to find a lady to stick my penis in? The talent show is this Friday.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. The kids visit their lockers to change books.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jessie|Talk to you, Bertha.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bertha|Okay, see you later, Jessie.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Hey Bertha.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bertha|Oh, hey Jimmy. What\'s goin\' on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well Bertha, I was wondering if I could stick my penis in your vagina?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bertha|What?? No way! \'\'[Cartman walks into view, overhears, then stops to listen]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|But the talent show is tomorrow! \'\'[Bertha slaps him]\'\' Ooo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bertha|Jerk! \'\'[walks away, Cartman comes forward]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Jimmy, Jimmy, what the hell are you doing, man?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|I\'m trying to get laid. What\'s it look like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, you don\'t just go up to a girl and ask her if you can stick your penis in her vagina. Ye-you have to ask her on a date, take her out for some Italian food.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow, seems like you know a lot about this stuff, Eric. Have you gotten laid before?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sure, lots of times. I\'ve been laid, like, five thousand times.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, wha-what do I do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I told you: a date and then Italian food. And then you gotta make her think you\'re a good listener.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Eric, I can\'t tell you why, but it\'s \'\'very\'\' important that I score to-night! Can you come on the date and help me? You\'re like a white... Hitch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Why sure, they do this all the time in movies and TV shows. You go on the date and wear an earpiece, and I\'ll be nearby, secretly telling you all the right things to say.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow! Thanks, Eric.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A house, night. A woman is reading a book on her sofa. The doorbell rings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mom|Shauna honey, I think your little date is here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|\'\'[heads for the door]\'\' Okay, Mom. \'\'[opens it, and finds Jimmy waiting outside]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Hey Shauna.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|Hi Jimmy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[hiding in some bushes nearby]\'\' Okay Jimmy. First off, tell her how good she looks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow, Shauna, you look f-fantastic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|Thanks, Jimmy. Where are we going?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|We\'re going to an authentic Italian restaurant, Buca de Fagghecini}}\n{{ScriptScene|Buca de Fagghecini, dinnertime.

I can\'t stand her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[at a nearby booth]\'\' Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, even though what she\'s saying now isn\'t interesting at all, you say, "Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow, that is very interesting. Please tell me more.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|Really? Well, Kelligan bought the same purse and I was like, "No WAY do I want it now!" because who wants a purse that both their best friends have, right? And so-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Roma sets some plates of food on his table]\'\' All right, when she stops yappin\' again, say "Wow, I\'ve never thought of it that way before, but you\'re right."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|I guess \'\'that\'s\'\' why I figured, "Who needs friends like THAT?"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow, I\'ve never thought of it that way before, but you\'re right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|It\'s like I told Debbie: "If you\'re gonna go out with my friends-"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right Jimmy, when she finally shuts her trap again, I want you to repeat whatever she said, and then follow it with "Wow, how insightful."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|"And so if you\'re gonna be \'\'that\'\' way, I don\'t \'\'need\'\' to be your friend."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|"If you\'re gonna be that way, I don\'t need to be your friend." Wow, how insightful.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|You know, Jimmy, you are a great listener.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|Yeah. I mean, no other boys really communicate like you do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Oh, I\'m so glad you think so, Shauna, because I really wanna stick my penis in your vagina.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, nice, Jimmy, very nice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|\'\'[stunned]\'\' ...What??? \'\'[crosses her arms and glares]\'\' I\'m not doing that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|But the talent show is tomorrow night!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shauna|Creep! \'\'[throws her glass of water at him and walks out.

Well, most of the school...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Garrison|Welcome students and parents to the annual South Park Elementary Talent Show! \'\'[some applause]\'\' We have a lot of little talented performers to get through, so the quicker you shut up, the quicker this will be over! \'\'[everyone quiets down]\'\' Okay, first up we have Billy Turner, from the third grade, who will be doing an alto sax solo. \'\'[out comes Billy with his alto sax and he begins to play Frиre Jacques. His notes are tentative and wobbly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, out on the front curb. Jimmy sits there sobbing. Officer Barbrady\'s police car rolls gently towards him and stops.

I I keep getting an erection for no reason! Okay! But I can\'t get any of the girls here to let me... do it to them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Well of course not, Jimmy. Little girls don\'t wanna have sex.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Then why does God make it so that my penis gets hard if girls don\'t wanna have it in their vaginas? It\'s like a cruel joke.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Well, Jimmy, the girls here are young and pure. They\'re not like the ladies down at Colfax Point.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|...Colfax Point?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Well yeah, those women will have sex with anybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Really?
