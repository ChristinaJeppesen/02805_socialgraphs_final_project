That \'\'is\'\' the phone.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He sets his plate aside and gets up to answer it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Terrance, this is Scott.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh. \'\'[To Phillip.]\'\' Hey, it\'s Scott.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He covers the receiver while Phillip answers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Tell him he\'s a smelly bastard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Phillip says hello, Scott.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Just shut up and listen. You\'ve unleashed a monster onto Canada! And only you can get rid of him, even though I hate you, and I wish you had cancer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|You are such a dick, Scott.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[Pause.]\'\' \'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|\'\'You\'re\'\' a dick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|The two of you are the most annoying dicks in Canada. You give other Canadians a bad name. And if I had my hair-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|I\'m sorry, Scott. Could you hold on a minute?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Sure.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance raises his left leg, places the receiver between his legs, and farts on it. He and Phillip laugh as he lowers his leg.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|How do you like that, Scott?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|You son of a bitch! I\'ll get you if it\'s the last thin--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh wait, I have another call on, Scott. Can you hold on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Sure.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance raises his left leg, places the receiver between his legs, and farts on it. He lowers his leg and resumes talking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh, that was Sir Smelly. He says \'hello.\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Goddammit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh, wait a second, Scott.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Sure.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance raises his left leg...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|I mean, no! You listen to me! If you want to save Canada, you\'ll meet me at Karl\'s Kroff Dinner Restaurant in half an hour. \'\'[Hangs up.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Celine Dion\'s House 4:07 P.M. Celine Dion and Ugly Bob are back in bed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine Dion|Oh, Ugly Bob, I\'m so confused. I love your personality, but you are so wretchedly ugly.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She puffs on a cigarette.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ugly Bob|Maybe the baby will have your face instead of mine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine Dion|We can only hope. I suppose we\'ll be okay as long as you keep that bag on your head.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Three Republican Guards burst through the bedroom door, and Saddam follows.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine Dion|What\'s this?! \'\'[Gasps.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|He-yy there. I\'m Saddam Hussein. I\'m a big fan of Polo. I\'ve been searching a long time for you, Celine Dion.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ugly Bob|Oh no, you don\'t. She\'s my bitch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Eh! Who are you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ugly Bob|I\'m Bob. But my friends call me "Ugly Bob", because I have the features of a deformed burn victim.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Really? I thought all Canadians looked alike. Let me see.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bob takes off the bag and everybody in the room screams.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Well, I\'m sorry, guy. You know, I could cure that face of yours.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bob and Celine now look at him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ugly Bob|You can?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Sure! I just need a favor. There is a Canadian football game tomorrow: the Ottawa Roughriders vs. the Vancouver Roughriders. It is at that game that I will officially turn the Canadian flag over to my Iranian one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine Dion|What? Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Hey! Don\'t worry about that. Take a load off, don\'t worry about it. Look over here. All I need is for Celine Dion to sing our Iranian national anthem at the game - to finalize my hostile takeover of Canada. What do you say?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ugly Bob|Did you say, "hostile takeover of Canada"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|No, no, relax there, fella!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Celine takes another bag and places it over Bob\'s head.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Karl\'s Kroff Dinner Palace 4:36 P.M. Terrance and Phillip are there. So are some pictures of Saddam.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Well, Scott said to meet him here, but he\'s not showing up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Phillip farts and they laugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Well, while we\'re waiting, why don\'t we search for treasure?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh. Good idea. Let\'s search for treasure.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Phillip looks around, but Terrance ends up looking at his feet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[Arrives.]\'\' What are you idiots doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|We\'re looking for treasure!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Is that some kind of metaphor for a kind of search that can\'t be described?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|No, we\'re searching for treasure.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Listen. I have an inside scoop. There\'s an Iraqi dictator who is quietly and slowly taking over Canada.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Yes. You mean Saddam Smelly. We saw him on the telly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Well, what are you two gonna do aboat it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|What do you mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|It\'s your fault that he\'s here! You brought the Iraqis back with you on your plane when you rescued your kidnapped daughter! \'\'[they gasp.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|You mean, we are to blame?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|That\'s right. And now you must make amends. Tomorrow, Saddam will try to finalize his takeover of Canada, at the Roughriders-Roughriders football game. It will be your only shot at wiping them all out. Here, take this.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He hands him a box with a watch face on it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|What is this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|It\'s a bomb. You must strap it to yourselves, go to the game, and sacrifice your lives to take out Saddam\'s minions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|That plan\'s scary!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Well, you must do it for Canada.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|For Canada, Terrance.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A display of solidarity begins. He puts his arm behind Terrance.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|For Canada, Phillip.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance puts his arm behind Phillip. Then they let go and leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Yes, Terrance and Phillip. And when the dust is settled, Canada will be rid of both: the Iraqis and your immature fart humor.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance and Phillip\'s House 12:20 P.M.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Well. Phillip, I am very sad that we have to die for Canada.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Yes. This bomb will blow us both to smithereens. But we really have no choice. Only our deaths can bring Canada life.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance farts, and they laugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|That\'s funny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Hey! Wait a minute. That fart gives me pause.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Why is that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|That smelly Saddam Hussein. He uses germ and chemical warfare, does he not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Yes. Apparently, he does.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Terrance! Get the phone book! We must call every Canadian we can!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh, Phillip. It sounds like you have an idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|I do, Terrance.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Phillip picks up the receiver and dials away... Barky comes up and farts, then leaves. Terrance and Phillip laugh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Canada Stadium 11:32 A.M.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|And the Roughriders are giving the Roughriders a run for their money! \'\'[Not if the score is valid: 28-7.]\'\' All else aside, I must say that the Roughriders \'\'[To his right.]\'\' are simply outmatched by these Roughriders \'\'[To his left. Red and blue Roughriders go after the football and time runs out. A horn blows and the referee blows his whistle.]\'\' And that\'s going to take us to halftime. Be sure to stick around for the halftime show: Saddam and the Electric Iraqis in a salute to hostile takeovers!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A long platform is put together from two shorter ones, each one having half the Canadian flag. The flag is made whole when the platforms are put together. A band plays and walks across the field and the crowd cheers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Well, I guess it\'s time, old friend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Yes. Prepare the alert!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Saddam climbs onto the platform with some difficulty, then rights himself and takes the microphone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Hello to my Canadian friends. Everybody relax. Take a rest. Lift your feet up. Those Dogs Are Barking.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He waits for a reaction, but none comes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|You may have noticed some changes to your country. Don\'t worry about that, the changes will continue. I\'m here to announce once and for all that Canada will now be known as "New Baghdad!" Qoloh Qalah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A Canadian flag is taken down from its pole and an Iraqi one put up in its place. An Iraqi one is placed over the Canadian one on the platform. The audience gasps.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|You will bow down to me as your ruler! You will obey my laws or you will be killed!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Celine Dion and Ugly Bob are standing by as Saddam laughs derisively.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|And now you will sing the Iraqi national anthem...}}\n{{ScriptScene|A guard nudges Celine towards the microphone with the tip of his machine gun.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Or you will be stabbed in the head!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine Dion|Shtud balaa shtud inca inca brusht...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Now, Phlllip?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phlllip|Now, Terrance.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He puts on his gas-mask while Terrance brings out a bugle and sounds the alert. Everyone in the stadium then puts on masks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Saddam|Hey!! What the hell is this?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Celine puts on her mask.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine|Freh kashu kaliakaliakatchut...}}\n{{ScriptScene|People all around the stadium turn around and start to drop trousers, and fart. One man stands on his hands, leaving his derriere high in the air with legs spread open. A brown cloud starts to form over the stadium and it descends into the gridiron. Saddam starts to gag.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard|They\'re using chemical warfare! How could they?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|More brown clouds sweep across the field and seem to sweep Saddam along with them. He stumbles to the edge of the platform and the crowd cheers loudly. He finally falls and the clouds start to lift away. The Iraqi flag falls off the side of the platform as the people remove their masks and cheer some more.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|We did it, Phillip! We destroyed the Turks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|Oh, Glorious Day!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Some people come down and start kicking Saddam around. Bob and Celine take off their masks while holding hands. She takes her hand away and quickly places a paper bag on Bob\'s head. A woman takes Saddam\'s left arm, a man takes his head. Terrance and Phillip come down from their seats and rush to the platform, and all stadium seats are now empty. Terrance and Celine hold hands.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Celine Dion|Phillip, Terrance! You\'ve saved Canada!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Ooh, it was all Phillip\'s idea.}}\n{{ScriptScene|They progress to full embrace.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ugly Bob|God bless you, Phillip. \'\'[Embraces him.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|\'\'[Pulls away.]\'\' Don\'t touch me, Ugly Bob!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[Walking up.]\'\' Hey, What the hell happened? You were supposed to be blown up!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phillip|We came up with a better plan. You see, Scott, after all your criticism, it was farting that saved Canada.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Oh! That is so juvenile!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Terrance and Celine have let go of each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Hey, Scott, you like apples?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Of course!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|\'\'[Farts on him.]\'\' How do you like them apples? \'\'[Laughs heartily.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'\'I hate you, Terrance and Phillip!!!\'\'\' \'\'[Goes away.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Oh Celine Dion.

More crowds are seen, then some cabins, some mountains, and finally a moose.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|<poem><i>Oh, Canada we stand on guard for thee</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|The whole scene is now framed in a maple-leaf outline, with the moose in the center grazing. He looks up. When the anthem ends Terrance farts once more and laughs away.
