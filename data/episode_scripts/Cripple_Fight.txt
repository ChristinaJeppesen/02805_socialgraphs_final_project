Jimmy scrambles up on his crutches as Timmy tends to his bitten hand, and strikes Timmy again, and again. Jimmy then swings his legs into Timmy and flies off - a flying kick. Timmy rises and jumps on Jimmy, grabbing his head and ramming it into the ground twice, then performing an eye gouge. Jimmy works around it and throws Timmy off, then jumps on him, driving a knee into Timmy\'s crotch five times, shot from various angles.

Timmy punches Jimmy with his left fist, sending Jimmy spinning around. Jimmy swings at Timmy again, but Timmy ducks and catches Jimmy in a sleeper hold, holding on for a few seconds. Jimmy escapes, then picks Timmy up high and brings him down upon the left knee for a back-breaker. Timmy rises and responds with a neck-breaker, knocking Jimmy out.

If \'\'I\'m\'\' free to express \'\'my\'\'self, then the Scouts have to be free to express \'\'themselves\'\', too. I know these men. They are good men. They are \'\'kind\'\' men. They do what \'\'they\'\' think is best for kids. No matter how wrong we think they might be, it isn\'t right for us to force them to think our way. It\'s up to us to persuade, and help them see the light, not extort them to. Please, don\'t cut the Scouts\' funding. The Scouts help and have always helped a lot of kids. That\'s why I \'\'love\'\' them. I will continue to persuade them to change their mind, but this is the wrong way to do it.
