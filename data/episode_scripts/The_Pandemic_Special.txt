Can everyone hear me okay? Thanks for turning out, everyone. You know, we\'ve all been through a lot these past several months.

Amazing. \'\'[a business growth chart for 2020 pops up, showing how the business has grown since the pandemic began.]\'\' Tegridy Farms weed has seen a 400% increase in sales since the shutdown in March.

I\'m not giving up!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|All right, that was about five minutes. \'\'[on the bullhorn to the officers]\'\' Okay, boys!

I just wanna have fun again. \'\'[Cartman looks at him]\'\' I wanted to see that I could go out in the world and do things that I used to do, but I can\'t.
