Now-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[peeved]\'\' Hoh!

They\'ve been there all day. \'\'[Outside, Tolkien messes with a trash can. Cartman notices and walks over, pushing the trash can down. Stan plays with a rock on the steps. Craig inches his way towards Stan, who watches him from time to time, and Francis is up a tree.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hoh, hoh hoh hoh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Hah hah hahah hah! \'\'[the other boys turn and start grunting. Stan chases Craig away from the steps, then returns to sitting there.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hoh hoh hoh! \'\'[picks up his rock and plays with it]\'\' Hohohoh hoh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|Looks like my little girl has a lot of gentlemen callers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Mom, why is everyone acting so different around me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|Sweetie, you\'re just blossoming into a woman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|But, I, I don\'t know if I want to. Sometimes I think I\'m not as smart and cool as they say, that everyone just tells me I am because of my hooters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|Sweetie, you\'re a Stevens. And Stevens women are always told they\'re really, really smart. \'\'[gives her a hug and then leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Mom? \'\'[her mom stops and turns around]\'\' What\'s six times eight?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|Oho, sweetie, those are two completely different numbers. \'\'[satisfied, she turns around and walks out and downstairs. She opens the front door and the boys back away grunting]\'\' Alright boys, time to be getting home. Bebe\'s not feeling well and she can\'t come out today. Go on, shoo. \'\'[the boys walk away slowly, grunting in disappointment. A whistling sound is heard and a space shuttle crashes into a field across the street. The boys stop at the sight.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hoh. Hoh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Astronaut 1|Aah. We made it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Astronaut 2|Boys, can you call 9-1-1 for us? \'\'[the boys start to grunt again. Stan backs up into the crowd of boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Astronaut 1|Oh my God. We\'ve landed on Earth thousands of years in the future and apes have taken over!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Astronaut 2|I knew it! You blew it up, didn\'t you?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Astronaut 1|I don\'t want to live in this futuristic madness! \'\'[pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Astronaut 2|Take your ape rule and go to hell! \'\'[pulls out a gun, shoots himself in the head, and falls down dead.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[sighs]\'\' Having boobs sucks.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, later. A man walks in and goes to his desk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Well hello there, little girl. My name is Dr. Hallis. What can I do for you today? \'\'[sits at his desk]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|I wanna have breast-reduction surgery. \'\'[the doctor leans forwards and visually inspects Bebe\'s chest]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|You?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Yes. I have two hundred and twelve dollars in nickels and a gold bracelet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Well, young lady, I\'m afraid that we don\'t offer breast reduction surgery to girls of your age.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Why not? Britney Spears got fake ones when she was a teenager. Why can\'t I have mine taken off?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Because making breasts larger is a beautiful and wonderful thing. Making them smaller is... insane.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|I think it\'s insane to want them bigger.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Why do you... hate your breasts so?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Ever since I got these stupid things everyone treats me differently. I feel like I might be treated differently the rest of my life.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Oh, come on now, that\'s just silly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Blonde nurse|\'\'[nice shape, walks in with a folder]\'\' Here\'s the Anderson file, Doctor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|\'\'[looks up, looks down and grins, then looks up again]\'\' Oh, awesome. Thank you so much, Jillian. That\'s great. Oh, God-damn. Thank you so much. \'\'[The nurse walks out. Bebe lowers her eyelids halfway]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brunette nurse|\'\'[not as nicely shaped, walks in with a cup and plate]\'\' And here\'s the coffee you wanted, doctor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|\'\'[quickly, subdued, looks askance]\'\' Yeah, whatever. Get out of here. \'\'[the nurse walks out, and he addresses Bebe again]\'\' Now, I was saying?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Please, you have to help me. I think that if my breasts keep growing this way, boys will give me whatever I want.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Yeah, so? That\'s great, isn\'t it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|No it\'s not, because if I grow up getting everything I want, having things made easy for me because I have hot knockers, then I\'m gonna grow up to be a lame person. If I\'m handed everything in life, then my chances of becoming a lawyer or a marine biologist are zero.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|That may be true, but I\'m afraid I just cannot ethically perform a breast-reduction surgery on an eight-year-old girl.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Damnit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|If, on the other hand, you\'d like to make them a little bigger, I think now might be the right time to size up, hm?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Oh, fuck off! \'\'[walks off in disgust]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, day. In the dining room Randy reads the paper. Sharon enters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy, could you have a talk with Stanley?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Why? What\'s the matter with him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|It\'s just that, well, he\'s been acting a little different lately. \'\'[Randy looks. In the living room Stan has taken out his crayons and drawn some figures on the wall]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[disheveled, in his primal state]\'\' Aaaa-ta. \'\'[starts drawing another boob. The wall is covered with them, singly or in pairs. One stick-figure woman has a large pair]\'\' Aaaa-ta.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|He\'s been ignoring his homework, and, all of his friends. I can\'t figure out why.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[picks up a stick and moves it around]\'\' Aaaa-ta. Aaaa-ta.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ohhh boy. Looks like he\'s starting to notice breasts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[relieved and proud]\'\' Oh yes. Our little Stanley is starting to become a man. \'\'[Randy leaves his seat at the table and approaches Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[points to the wall with his stick]\'\' Ahta. Ah, ahta!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hey there, son.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[turns to face his father]\'\' Hoh? Ahta. \'\'[points to the wall]\'\' Ahta.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yes, ahta. Let\'s have a talk, Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ahta.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Stan, as you get older, boobs - bu-these "ahta" will start becoming a major part of your life.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ahta? \'\'[Sharon walks behind Randy and sits on one of the sofa\'s arms]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|But Stanley, you can\'t let them get in the way of your friends. There are a lot of boobs out there, son. But they\'re just boobs; your friends... are forever.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[considers each argument]\'\' Friends. Ahta.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I know you think this set of boobs is important now, but those boobs will be replaced by another set of boobs. Boobs will come and go, and then, someday, \'\'[places his left hand on Sharon\'s right shoulder. She smiles]\'\' you\'ll meet a pair of boobs that you want to marry. And those become the boobs that matter the most.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[putting her right arm around Randy]\'\' I love you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|If you can just understand that, Stanley, you\'ll see that boobs hold no \'\'real\'\' power at all.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bebe\'s house, night. The house is dark, so she\'s asleep. The camera zooms in on her, and her breasts start to blink under her gown.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Right breast|The boys are at war. All is going as planned.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Left breast|Yes. Soon all the boys will be brought to their knees.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Right breast|We grow larger every day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Left breast|And stronger.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Right breast|Soon the entire tow- \'\'[Bebe awakens]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Left breast|Sh! Sh! She\'s awake!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Right breast|Ah, quiet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[shrieks and kicks her blanket off]\'\' MOM!! MOM!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|\'\'[rushes to Bebe\'s room and enters]\'\' What is it, Bebe?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[scared]\'\' My breasts!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|\'\'[approaches the bed, sits, and holds her]\'\' Oh, sweetheart, you\'re just becoming a young lady.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|No, they\'re conspiring! Mom, they were talking! They wanna destroy the town!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Stevens|\'\'[beat]\'\' Yes, darling, your breasts have a power that will unleash itself as you get older. They feed off the misery of boys and grow to bring woe wherever they can. You\'re blossoming into a woman. \'\'[hugs her]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|That does it! I\'m NOT letting these things run my life!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, day. Dr. Hallis walks in with a file and quickly addresses his prospective client.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Young lady, are you absolutely sure you want to consider this kind of procedure for your breasts?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Yes! I want to get breast implants!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Testaburger|I tried to tell her she was too young.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Well, it is a different time, Mrs. Testaburger. Society puts a lot of pressure on your daughter to look her best. Having small breasts can make her feel unimportant.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Testaburger|\'\'[considers the doctor\'s argument...]\'\' But she\'s eight!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Yes, well, not too young to feel flat and therefore, not pretty.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|That\'s what \'\'I\'\' said.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|However, young lady, I\'m afraid breast implants are not for everyone. \'\'[takes out a notepad]\'\' I\'ll need to carefully assess your physical and mental condition to see if augmentation is truly the best way for you to go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|I have three thousand dollars, cash. \'\'[her mom blanches]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|\'\'[quickly disposes of the pad and pen, then rises and leaves the desk]\'\' You pass. Let\'s do this thing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Testaburger|\'\'[mortified]\'\' Oh, wait. You\'re gonna do it right now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Suuure. Breast augmentation is now a very simple procedure. \'\'[holds Wendy\'s right arm up and points to the armpit]\'\' What we do is make a small incision in the armpit where it won\'t be seen. Then we take this little plastic bag and gently place it in the chest where we fill it with salt water.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Testaburger|I still don\'t know about this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|Look. Us plastic surgeons have one philosophy. If we can help someone\'s self-esteem a little, then why not do it if they have three thousand dollars?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Operating room, moments later. Wendy is hooked up and sedated. The first incision is made to the left armpit and the flesh pulled back hard. The nurse hands the doctor the first implant, which he shoves in Wendy\'s chest.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Hallis|\'\'[shove]\'\' Cha! \'\'[shove]\'\' Gotta! \'\'[shove]\'\' Jam it! \'\'[shove]\'\' Up there! \'\'[shove]\'\' Get! \'\'[shove]\'\' In! \'\'[shove]\'\' There! \'\'[shove]\'\' You! \'\'[shove]\'\' Bitch! \'\'[shoves faster]\'\' Get! \'\'[shove]\'\' In! \'\'[shove]\'\' There! \'\'[shove]\'\' You! \'\'[shove]\'\' Bitch! \'\'[the implant is finally in place; everything is covered in blood]\'\' Hah! \'\'[wipes his brow]\'\' Okay, there\'s one, Wendy. Doing great.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. Mr. Mackey is back teaching the class. The kids are at their seats.

Where Bebe?! Bebe! Bebe! \'\'[he and a few others grunt a bit]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay, we all need to start studying more and fighting less, m\'kay? \'\'[the grunts start up again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bradley|Bebe! \'\'[more grunts.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ahta! \'\'[more grunts. Bebe enters wearing a cardboard box over her clothes. The boys quiet down.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Hey guys. \'\'[a few boys grunt back with "Hi!!" "Hey." "Hm." as she heads for her seat. The boys are confused.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Have you guys noticed that Bebe isn\'t as cool as she used to be? \'\'[Bebe smiles at her uncoolness]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Yeah. What the hell happened to us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my God. I get it now. It was Bebe\'s boobs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Bebe\'s boobs?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Oh cool! It worked!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t you guys see? Boobs... do something to our brains. They fill our brains with illusions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sssss-so ...Bebe ...didn\'t become smart and cool? It was just her boobs?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Yes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So, Bebe is actually just as lame as she ever was?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Right. My boobs just clouded your judgment.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But that sucks. I don\'t want something to have that much power over me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t think it will, you guys, as long as we realize it. We must learn to control their power over us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Yeah. Screw boobs! They\'re stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|I\'m sorry for fighting, you guys. \'\'[all the boys leave their seats and start apologizing to each other, hugging each other]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[moved by this display of affection]\'\' Aw, that\'s so sweet, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Let\'s never let boobs come between us again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Boys|Hear Hear!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Boobs are stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[enters with her new, ample implants]\'\' Hi, everybody. \'\'[the boys look at her for a long while, then start laughing heartily.
