Woohoo!! \'\'[Jeff is left all alone]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at Nerzod Productions. Cartman is bent over once more, with his pants down. The visitors have finished working on him}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Alien|That should get the relay working again. \'\'[begins to walk off. The boys follow]\'\' All right, Earthlings, if you\'ll step over this way we\'ll erase your memories and get you back to Earth. \'\'[a visitor brings him a ringing phone]\'\' Oh, excuse me. \'\'[picks up the receiver]\'\' This is Nagix. Uh-huh. Oh no. Oh no, really? And it\'s, it\'s for sure? All right, I\'ll break the news to everyone. No, no I, I understand. Thanks. \'\'[hangs up the phone and walks back to the boys]\'\' Well, you kids can go back to Earth if you want, but I\'m afraid it won\'t be there for long. The show\'s been canceled.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?? Who canceled us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Najix|The universal network heads. They say the Earthlings have become aware of the show, so it won\'t be funny anymore. \'\'[walks off to address the rest of the staff]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh shit, did we do that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Najix|Everyone, can I have your attention real quick? Uuh, look, I just got a call from the network and I\'m afraid \'\'Earth\'\' has been canceled}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Staff|Awww.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Najix|Now, now, it was a great run and I think we should all be really proud. \'\'[a smattering of applause]\'\' Let\'s call in a demolition crew to strike the Earth for resources.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wait! Wait, they can\'t do this! Uh, let \'\'us\'\' talk to the network heads!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Najix|Wouldn\'t do any good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, we have to try!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Please, take us to them! Please!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Najix|All right, kids, we\'ll take you to the network heads. But I warn you: nobody has ever gotten the executives to uncancel a show once the call has been made. Nobody. \'\'[the boys look at each other, and several more scoops of ice cream falls out of the alien\'s taco ass]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Earth. A view of it from outer space. A few seconds later, an immense crane floats towards Earth with a wrecking ball ready and beeper going. It stops. Two alien laborers sit inside and the driver activates the crane arm. The wrecking ball moves and strikes western Africa. A shot of people running across a bridge. The whole planet moves as if by an earthquake. Chef almost loses his balance at the space center as the ground undulates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|What the hell is that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jeff|There\'s a huge ship of some kind in Earth\'s orbit! \'\'[schematics of the ship and Earth appear on screen, and the impact point is shown as well]\'\' But why? Wait a minute! Chaos theory!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Chaos theory??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jeff|Chaos theory, it was, it was first thought of in the sixties. Sixty. That\'s the number of episodes they made of \'\'Punky Brewster\'\' before it was canceled. Cancelled...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jeff|Don\'t you see? The show is over! The aliens are canceling \'\'Earth\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Oh my God!

We\'re just checking out our new show.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 2|We took a hundred beings from the planet Marklar and put them on an asteroid with sentient beings from the Horsehead Nebula. It-it\'s a riot!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 1|They hate each other!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 2|Gah, why? \'\'[Stan nudges Kyle, who pulls a letter out from his pocket and reads]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Mighty, powerful network executives, we have come in a great distance in order to have--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 1|Oooo, I\'m starving!

Please.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 1|\'\'[Both Joozians are holding menus]\'\' Oh I\'m sorry, Earthlings, but you have to realize the universe is a business.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 2|You\'ve made it to a hundred episodes, you should be proud!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 1|Yeah, a show should never go past a hundred episodes, or else it starts to get stale with ridiculously stupid plotlines and settings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Waitress|\'\'[another Joozian]\'\' Here\'s your order of gespahtgaplachfenachenblah. \'\'[sets a large platter before the executives and lifts the cover. The executives dig in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But, sirs, we think our show is just getting good. \'\'[Kyle thinks about the food, then decides to pick up a fork-full and taste it]\'\' I mean, we\'re just now starting to see people get \'\'really\'\' pissed off at each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh my God, this is great!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joozian 1|You must have some Joozian ancestry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[miffed at the link, rests his head on his left hand]\'\' Tell us about it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, there\'s five billion people on our show.
