It\'s Butters, and behind him are police drones and National Guard drones}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh hey Butters. Sup?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Do you remember when I showed you the video of the little bird eggs? Well that\'s the last time I felt happy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, what\'s the matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I have to tell the truth. I want you and Kenny to come with me and tell Craig\'s mom we\'re sorry and that we\'ll-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay okay okay. Come inside, there\'s drones out here. \'\'[takes Butters in and closes the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I don\'t want anymore discussions, Eric! I don\'t want anymore excuses!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I just want to end this so we can take our punishment and be done with it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[while Butters speaks]\'\' Okay. Okay. Butters, Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I don\'t want all these drones everywhere! Nobody does!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters. BUTTERS. All right, all right Butters, fine! I have a way that we can get rid of all the drones.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|You do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes. Everyone is sick of it, it\'s just that everyone is waiting for everyone else to stop. We can put an end to it all tonight. We\'re just gonna need one thing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Your dad\'s drone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|NO! There is NO WAY I\'m gonna-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters. Butters Butters! Jennifer Lawrence\'s butthole didn\'t take picture of itself! It started with her! Right? Just like this started with you spying on birds! Now I\'m willing to bail you out of all this, but I swear it\'s the last time! Okay?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|...Okay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, night. Stephen is at the sofa preparing a sizeable bomb. He\'s soldering the ends of a cable together, then takes a sip of spirits, then picks up a grenade launcher and pops a grenade in place. He stands up}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Time to end this hobby once and for all! \'\'[he moves stealthily to his garage, opens the door, and jumps in ready to blow his drone up, but finds it missing again]\'\' No! NOOOO!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house. Kenny is back with Butters and Cartman as Cartman gets ready to execute his next big idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[with the controller]\'\' Alright, we\'ve got power. Prepare for takeoff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|If this doesn\'t work, we\'re dead.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'ll work, Butters. If there\'s one thing we\'ve learned, it\'s that drones can\'t resist Craig\'s mom. \'\'[he gets the drone going. It rises, pulling behind it a blow-up doll made to resemble Laura, with a large bushy wig over the crotch. The drone and doll hover away from Cartman\'s house.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Police Station, night. The police drones, some with shields, hover over the civilian drones. A news drone flies by. Both sides jockey for positions, but then notice the National Guard drones arriving. One of the civilian drones then notices the sex doll floating by. The doll floats up to the police drones and National Guard drones and they take notice too. The doll floats away and all the drones, civilian, police, and National Guard, follow. The doll floats through the town gathering more and more drones. It goes over the bridge and across Stark\'s Pond, luring all the drones away. Where they ended up is anybody\'s guess.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A convention room, night, several days later. Stephen Stotch is at the podium with the rest of the town seated at tables. Everyone is applauding the Tuckers, but Laura isn\'t pleased.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|We\'re here tonight to pay tribute to a woman who overcame humiliation, who rose above the monsters invading her privacy and said "No more!" Just when it seemed that we were about to live in a world controlled by drones, she did something miraculous. And someday, our children\'s children will still be telling stories about how Craig\' mom flew through the town and led all the drones away. \'\'[more applause, and Laura buries her face in her right hand. A minstrel with lute comes out to sing Laura\'s praises]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minstrel|<poem><i>Have you heard the tale of Craig\'s mom\'s bush\nAnd the night that it saved us from drones?\nNobody knew the power it had.\nThey just thought it was shaggy and gross.\nCraig\'s mom live a life of shame and despair\nEveryone feared her great giant bush!</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Laura|They didn\'t!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Minstrel|<poem><i>But then when drones were filling the sky,\nShe unfurled her bush and she used it to fly.\nCraig\'s mom\'s bush, Craig\'s mom\'s bush.\nGargantuan thicket of madness.\nBigger than earth and denser than gold.\nTruly a magical bush to behold.</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' and Cartman\'s table. Butters is a bit distraught. The minstrel continues with the lute and some whistling}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, you see, Butters, everything worked out. \'\'[Butters doesn\'t respond]\'\' "Oh, thank you, Eric. I screwed up everything, but now everyone\'s happy.
