The scene freezes, and the new title comes up: "South Park in Aspen", then the scene continues. The adults are in happy awe as a woman walks by with her two poodles in front of a jewelry store. The next shot is of the four boys looking out marveling at the sights. They pass a man snorting cocaine in plain view in front of Bernie\'s. Next shot is of a resort in which a skier finishes his ski run. The entrance is shown: "Aspen Heaven: A Time-Share Community." The station wagon stops in front of a condominium complex and everyone gets out, making their way to the entrance. Fade out.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fade in, next morning.

Having a good...? \'\'[puts his left hand to his ear, hoping for an answer. The boys just look at him] Time\'\', that\'s right. Now, just a few safety things to keep in mind: First of all, look straight ahead when you ski. You look down, you\'re gonna fall, you\'re gonna have a bad time. Also, be aware of skiers around you. You run into another skier, your skis are gonna cross, gonna have a bad time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|So where\'s the part where we have a \'\'good\'\' time?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thumper|Hey, little dude, you got some crap right here. \'\'[motions to the nose, where Butters does indeed have crap]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wuh, that\'s my face, sir.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thumper|Alright, we\'re gonna do this without any poles until we know our two primary feet positions. To go slow, we wedge our skis together \'\'[he puts his indices and thumbs together; front ski tips touch]\'\', in the shape of a slice of pizza. Then to go faster, we put \'em parallel, like...

But what if I told you you could own one of our properties for only eight thousand dollars!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|Wow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|For only eight thousand dollars we can buy a condo here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Well you see, "time-share" means you buy the condo with about twenty other people like yourselves \'\'[exits screen left and immediately enters screen right]\'\' You \'\'[puts his hands together]\'\' "share" the condo with other investors and pick the \'\'[points to his watch]\'\' "time" you want to stay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|\'\'[makes a fist with his right hand]\'\' Share, \'\'[makes a fist with his left hand]\'\' time. \'\'[joins his fists together]\'\' Time share.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|So then it\'s not really ours.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Sure it is, one twenty-fourth and a half yours! You see, time-share has made it possible for even working-class people like you to say, "I\'ve got a little place in Aspen."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|Try it. Try saying it. "I\'ve got a little place in Aspen."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The parents|I\'ve got a little place in Aspen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Rolls off the tongue, doesn\'t it?

We\'d like to go hit the slopes now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Woll uh, you still gotta come to the time-share luncheon. We did give you a free condo for the weekend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Well your ad said we only had to attend a thirty-minute meeting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Right, but this isn\'t that meeting. The luncheon is that meeting. \'\'[the parents just look at him]\'\' Don\'t worry, you\'re gonna have a great free meal at the luncheon.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bunny slope, later.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[practicing his moves]\'\' ...French fries... pizza... french fries... \'\'[does the pizza moves and sees Cartman fallen on his back]\'\' come on, Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ugh, no more., \'\'[Kyle skis on.

That\'s the great thing about time-share. You get a little taste of luxuries you can\'t afford.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|And then share it with the people that come tomorrow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|All right, look, we\'ve been here for over three hours.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Yeah. Can we go now, please?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Of course you can. Go hit those slopes! \'\'[softly]\'\' If you could just please show me the backs of your table place cards real quick? \'\'[the others pick up their cards and look]\'\' Oh my God! You got the red sticker!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|They got the red sticker?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|They got the red sticker!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|What\'s the red sticker?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|Uh, well, well, that means if you come up to the condo sales office you\'ll receive one of three great prizes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|No, no-no-no-no. We, we did your meeting and we did your lunch, we\'re finished, okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Okay, okay, fine, I mean... \'\'[his voice gradually drops to a whisper]\'\' It would only take a second, but, I mean, you know, what did we do for you except, give you a free condo for the weekend. Huh. Seems like you could just... could just come up... and see what prize you had... \'\'[Josh begins to cry]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|O-all right!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bunny slope, even later.

Then Thumper spots Stan as Stan does barbells, then has him do a few more runs. The times aren\'t satisfactory.]\n\nAnd just show a lot of things happenin\' at once.\nRemind everyone of what\'s goin\' on. (What\'s goin\' on?)\n\n[Bulldozers show up at the youth center to knock it down, but a group of families shows up to protest the demolition. Next shot, the parents are still at those meeting, getting quite weary and tired]\n\nAnd with every shot, show a little improvement\nTo show it won\'t take too long\nThat\'s called a montage (Montage)\nEven Rocky had a montage (Montage)\n\n[Stan skis down a little faster, and Thumper shows him how much he\'s improved. Tad is then shown polishing his skills, landing after a ski jump and receiving Heather into his arms. The girl reads to Stan some more, but Stan\'s fallen asleep. She rouses him and resumes the lesson]\n\nIn any sport, if you want to go\nFrom just a beginner to a pro\nYou\'ll need a montage (Montage)\na simple little montage (Montage)\n\n[she shows Stan a few pictures in her book. Next, Stan is skiing down the hill with bricks weighing his shoulders down. Kyle stands on a bluff with a picture of himself and Stan and looks wistfully at it and at K-13. Cartman rubs his finger into his ass and gives a sleeping Butters the Hitler again. Cartman stifles a laugh]\n\nAlways fade out (Montage) into a montage (Montage)\n\n[Again, Stan skis down the hill with Thumper looking on. Now Thumper approves of the time. The instructor, the teen girl, and Stan look out at K-13 from a nearby hill, the camera at their backs]\n\nIf you fade out it seems like a long time (Montage) has passed in a montage (Montage)\nMontage (Montage)\n\n[The camera faces the trio now and zooms out slowly.
