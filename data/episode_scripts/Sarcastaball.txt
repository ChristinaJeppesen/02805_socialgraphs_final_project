Red 13! Sunshine and happy thoughts! Sunshine and happy thoouughts! HUT! \'\'[Cartman tosses the balloon back at him, and the players move forward. Butters backs up for a pass and throws the balloon up. The other team\'s player, #9, is ready]\'\' Oh no, that kid\'s gonna intercept it! \'\'[#9 catches it and grins]\'\' Good job, kid! \'\'[an SUV rools onto the field, crushing #9 before it stops. The balloon bounces away unscathed. Randy is shown driving the SUV, with Sharon in tow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|STAN?! Stan! \'\'[the players break their hugs and look at Randy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[runs with Sharon towards him]\'\' Get in the car, Stan! We\'re going home!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|We\'re sorry, Stanley, we don\'t want you playing this sport anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Hey, get off the field! M\'kay?! \'\'[Randy walks to the sideline to address the crowd]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Everyone! Everyone, listen! There\'s something you all need to know about sarcastaball. It turns out... it\'s totally safe. \'\'[a lot of fans have bought bottles of Butters\' Creamy Goo]\'\' Yeah, it\'s super safe! It\'s like so safe that we should have every kid play it-ugh! \'\'[gets a headache]\'\' Oh! Sorry, sorry. Hang on. Gotta not be so sarcastic. Ahem, let me try that again. Listen everyone... if you let your kids play sarcastaball, you\'re a fucking genius! Ogh!.. Gyugh! Cut, sorry. Let me try this again. \'\'[clears his throat again]\'\' Look, what I\'m trying to say is, we should have like, 10 sarcastaball leagues, because then everyone-! Would- \'\'[stomps his right foot in anger]\'\' God damn it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley, just get your things and come on. We\'re going home!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whoa, whoa, you can\'t, you can\'t tell me what to do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, we\'re your parents! We can\'t tell you what to do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Don\'t you see what this sport has done to your father? Do you want to end up like him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, right, like he doesn\'t exaggerate every disease he gets!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[stunned at the sarcasm coming from Stan]\'\' Ohohh, Randy, it\'s happening! \'\'[cries and turns towards Randy for a hug, which he gives]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[walks up and stands next to Stan]\'\' Mr. Marsh, listen. I know you care about your son, but he\'s a heck of a player! He\'s good at tickling, laughing, and getting along.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Look, the point has been made, okay?! I\'m warning you, being this sarcastic is dangerous!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'re not being sarcastic, Dad! Is it so hard to believe that we really enjoy a sport that has no violence? Is it so hard for you to believe that when Butters says "Competitiveness can be compassionate," he\'s being completely sincere?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I don\'t see how anyone could play this game with any sincerity.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s because you\'re too grumpy and negative to believe it. What you need... is a sports drink that can boost your levels of caring and goodness.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah Dad. You need some of this. \'\'[walks forward and gives him a small bottle of Butters\' Creamy Goo. Randy takes it and opens it, looking at the contents, then drinks it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|...\'\'[deadpans]\'\' This is cum. \'\'[everyone\'s jaws drop]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' room, night. Stephen and Linda are in the room, and just outside are Sheila, Randy, Stuart, and Liane.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|And you can just sit here in your room and think about what you\'ve done! \'\'[Butters is on his bed, looking chastened]\'\' Just because people try and make football a little safer by changing a kickoff rule doesn\'t mean YOU need to take it to "Oh, why don\'t we just drink each other\'s cum?"! Sarcasm like that is homophobic, chauvinistic, and completely lacking in maturity! Any questions?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|What\'s sarcasm and what\'s cum?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|We\'ll talk about that when you\'re older.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Come on, everybody, let\'s work on that kick off change and get back to some football. \'\'[all the adults leave, with Stephen closing the door behind him. Butters sighs, then gets under his covers for the night. As he drifts off to sleep, we get this voice-over]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jim Rome|Welcome back to Rome. Some of you might have seen me on TV last night. Turns out the drink I endorsed was semen. Turns out a little kid was just bein\' sarcastic. That kid\'s probably grounded for a month. Check that: I\'m sure he\'s grounded for two months. And a week. Football needs to be made safer, so why don\'t we have players in bras drinking semen? Yeah, that\'s a fastball right there. That\'s a real stroke of philosophic genius! More little kids drinking semen to finally bring back real football, and I don\'t know what else to say but "So long, sarcastaball, it was nice knowin\' you." Let\'s just hope nothin\' like this ever happens again. Probably won\'t. Not for another year. Check that: couple of days.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[wakes up and gasps]\'\' DAD! Hey, Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|\'\'[walks in]\'\' What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|My wiener is all stiff and pointy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Oh, well, Butters, that\'s just the friendly compass. See, whenever you have friends in the area, your little compass there tells you where they are. It\'s pointing up because Jesus is your friend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Thanks, Dad.}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia16|episode=08}}\n[[zh:讽刺球/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Sixteen]]'}]}}}}
