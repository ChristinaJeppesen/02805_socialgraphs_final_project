\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, city sidewalk, day. Stan, Cartman and Kyle head for a bright, colorful store called "Lolly\'s Candy Factory." Cartman carries three buckets: two on his back, supported by a crossbar, and a huge one on his head. The proprietor, Lolly, opens the door and sets a sign so it reads "OPEN," thus starting his business day. On his red apron is a large yellow lollipop with "LOLLY" printed over it. The boys stop and look.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lolly|\'\'[notices the kids and straightens up]\'\' Oh, hello there, kids!

A circle appears on a window and that piece of window is removed. Cartman sets the circle down and looks around. He reaches up to open the window latch, then opens the window door.

The empty glass sits on his nightstand. The camera zooms out to show Cartman sleeping with Clyde Frog. Cartman tosses in his bed and his dream appears. A circle appears. Outside of the circle is a lining to a jacket. Inside is someone\'s point of view. The surroundings seen in that circle indicates that this is Kenny\'s point of view. Kenny seems to be walking around in his own room. Kenny\'s arm appears and opens the door, and Kenny\'s mom appears at the end of the hall.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|Hurry up, Kenny! You\'re gonna be late for school! \'\'[the dream ends abruptly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[sits up, eyes wide open]\'\' Huh! ...

The blueprints are in place on an easel. The design is a slender tower rising some 120 feet into the sky. The camera pulls back to show the boys hammering boards into place. Stan\'s parents step outside to see the construction.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hey, if you boys are building a clubhouse you should start with the floor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[going for some more wood]\'\' We\'re not building a clubhouse, we\'re building a ladder to heaven.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|A ladder to heaven?

Even country singer Alan Jackson has shown up with a song he has written about the ladder. \'\'[camera pulls back to show Jackson to the reporter\'s left, strumming a guitar]\'\' Alan Jackson is, of course, the man who wrote the song, "Where Were You When the World Stopped Turning," about the tragedies on September 11.

The nuts! \'\'[fast forward to Kenny\'s room. He walks to a locked box by the window while looking at the ticket stub.

In the main hall President Bush is speaking to the Assembly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|Ladies and gentlemen of the UN, we have evidence that Saddam Hussein is up there building weapons of mass destruction. \'\'[shows a picture of the ladder and another one of the clouds. Both pictures have areas circled in]\'\' We have tried to communicate with Saddam through a psychic to ask him to let us see his warehouses in heaven. But \'\'he\'\' has \'\'not\'\' "re-spond-ed".}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Indian ambassador|Of course he has not responded, because he\'s DEAD!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|Right. Dead, and in heaven.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ambassador #1|This is preposterous! Even if there \'\'was\'\' a heaven, what makes you think Saddam Hussein\'s soul would be sent there?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|Our intelligence tells us that when Saddam was originally killed, his soul actually went to hell. But while in hell he began a homosexual relationship with Satan, the Prince of Darkness. Satan, however, decided he didn\'t want to be with Hussein anymore and broke up with him around August. \'\'[the French Ambassador has tuned out]\'\' When Saddam became jealous and tried to kill Satan\'s new lover, Chris, Satan had Saddam sent to heaven to live with Mormons as a punishment. \'\'[the assembly is overcome with silence]\'\' Questions? \'\'[more silence. An ambassador raises his hand]\'\' Yes?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ambassador #2|Are you high, or just incredibly stupid?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|I assure you, I am not high.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, day. A tower has gone up around the ladder at the Marsh house. Helicopters and cranes hoist. On the ground Stan and Kyle sit on some lumber watching the military take over the construction. Cartman runs up to them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys! You guys! I saw the ticket! \'\'[Stan and Kyle rise and line up on either side of Cartman]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What do you mean, fatass?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I just had another vision, you buttholes. Kenny didn\'t keep the ticket with him, he put it away somewhere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Where??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I don\'t know. I got conked in the head down at the abortion clinic \'\'[Kyle looks down at the lumber, then looks at the pile behind him]\'\' and I clearly saw Kenny putting the ticket in a little red box. \'\'[Kyle fishes around for a small solid piece of lumber, then finds one and aims it at Cartman\'s head]\'\' I just have to wait for another vision to come. I could clearly see through Ken- \'\'[thunk]\'\' AY! \'\'[is dazed for a bit, then recovers none too pleased, then glares at Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Do you see anything?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, Kyle. I see a DEAD JEW! \'\'[starts at Kyle, but Stan holds him back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whoawhoawhoa! Maybe Kyle\'s right. We gotta \'\'spark\'\' the vision somehow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Not by giving me brain damage!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Do you want a candy shopping spree or not?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[stares at Stan, then resigns to his former position]\'\' Alright, go ahead. \'\'[Kyle rears back and swings... thunk]\'\' AY!... no. \'\'[Kyle rears back and swings... thunk]\'\' AY!...}}\n{{ScriptScene|Near the back of the house. The neighbors are watching the construction. Sharon and Sheila arrive.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy! Gerald! We, we were wrong about heaven!

Angels swing into place slowly]\'\' The great a-nation of Japan reached a-hayben today about eight o\'crock Pacific Standard Time-eh. \'\'[one of the angels falls off her rope and hits the ground. The correspondent sees this and moves in front of her to block the shot.

And now for the weather in heaben, let\'s go to Natsako Semu.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Natsako Semu|Todeh weather in hebon, partry croudy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nobunaga|\'\'[fairly gloating]\'\' That\'s the news from heben. \'\'[the set creaks behind him and falls down, showing the studio.]\'\' Dame!

Idiots!"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Living room, seconds later.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh God, and we told our boys they\'d never reach heaven.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Kids!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Backyard. The crowd in and around the yard is immense now. George Bush and his staff are present.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|Good. As soon as the boys finish their ladder we\'ll be ready to take Saddam out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Do you really think this is a good idea, Randy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|If Saddam is building weapons, we have to stop him. With our weapons. \'\'[behind the crowd Cartman, Stan and Kyle return with buckets of candy. That conking finally worked]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ah, excuse me everyone! Uh, we\'re not working on the ladder anymore. Thank you, we\'re done. \'\'[everyone turns to look at the boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Some guy|Dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|Not working on the ladder? But the Japanese won\'t let us use theirs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Kenny didn\'t have the ticket stub. It was in his room. So we got all our candy, and you can all go home.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Wait, are you saying that you boys only wanted to build a ladder to heaven so you could get some candy??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...I\'ve never heard the words "only" and "candy" in the same sentence before.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field reporter|But... what about your lost friend? What about your fragile innocence and believing we could all get to heaven?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, well people make us kids believe that heaven is this white place with fluffy clouds and angels...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, but now we think maybe heaven isn\'t a place you can get to, maybe heaven is just an idea. A frame of mind or, or something gay like that. Maybe heaven... is this moment, right now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General|So, you\'re saying we should bomb this moment, right now. Right! Johnson!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnson|Sir!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|No, no. We shouldn\'t bomb anybody. These boys are right. The only heaven we can hope for is one here on earth, now. We should stop waiting to get into heaven and start trying to... create it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|Awwww. \'\'[the crowd begins to disperse and people begin to cry in appreciation]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|\'\'[moving off with his staff]\'\' And I was dumb enough to believe Saddam could actually be up there buildin\' bombs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Alan Jackson|\'\'Where were you when they decided heaven was a more intangible idea \'n you couldn\'t, you couldn\'t really get there?
