You\'re finally going to become a man today.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Butters, I think you should reconsider this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh, how come?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, you don\'t want your first kiss to be something you paid for. It\'s supposed to be special.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh God, why don\'t you sit under a rainbow and write a poem, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I gotta do this! I gotta know what it feels like!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back in the playground, moments later.

Rrright. \'\'[reaches into his pocket and pulls out a five dollar bill, then hands it to her]\'\' There you go. A five dollar bill, all for you. \'\'[smiles, but that turns into surprise when she whips out her wad of bills and adds the five dollar bill to it. She puts the wad back away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|All right, you ready? \'\'[she turns to face him and puckers up. He looks at her and leans in, closing his eyes. She does not close hers. They kiss on the lips. They then separate and Butters isn\'t sure what to make of it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Thank you! \'\'[turns right and walks back to the playground. As he approaches the boys, he raises his arms up and smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Atta boy Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tweek|You did it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|You\'re a man now! All right Butters good job!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kevin|Good job, Butters!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' room, night. He lies there awake, his hands behind his neck, pretty happy about the school day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[thinking to himself]\'\' Boy oh boy. I finally did it. I\'m a man now. \'\'[frowns, thinking of what being a man entails]\'\' Jeez, I\'m gonna start havin\' lots of responsibilities soon. I gotta start thinkin\' about a career. There\'s gonna be family and bills to start worrying about. M-no more play time for you, Butters! You gotta buckle down and find, and find yourself a way to make money. \'\'[aloud, smiling]\'\' Hey, I know.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Lunchtime at the school cafeteria. The kids are eating lunches, and Butters comes into view, stopping at a table of boys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey fellers! Fellers, do you like gettin\' kisses? \'Cause I know a girl that\'ll give you a great kiss for just five dollars!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[with a lisp]\'\' She\'ll kiss anybody?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Sure, Scott! Even if you got diabetes!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Behind the temp building, moments later.

Here\'s your two dollar cut again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[taking his cut]\'\' Boy oh boy, this sure is great! I\'ve been thinkin\', Sally: I could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too. We could make double the money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|Oh, that\'d be great, but I can\'t do kisses before school. I have swimming class.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Aww nuts! \'\'[walks off a bit]\'\' Well, I did have another idea. What if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, you know, we bring someone on, show her what to do, and then share all our money together.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|\'\'[walks up to him]\'\' Wow, you\'re right Butters. I should start expanding.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|We could have our very own... \'\'[puts out his hands and frames an imaginary plaque]\'\' kissin\' company.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' bedroom, day. He\'s got three easels up with info and four girls seated before him. He\'s using a pointer to highlight the info on the easels. He\'s laying out his business plan to the girls, who all have notebooks and pencils.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|The next key to a successful business is "innovation." I think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply can\'t afford the five dollars for a kiss, so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|Wow, that\'s a great idea, Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Why thanks. Sally, I think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect. Megan, I\'m thinkin\' about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Megan|\'\'[a third grader, taking notes]\'\' Got it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I got a kissing booth set up at the kids\' fair on Saturday so Kayla and Ashley, you take turns there. Any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets \'\'[puts up a smiling sun sticker on Sally\'s row on the work schedule]\'\' a little sunshine, but if you don\'t show up for work at all, I\'m afraid you get a stormy cloud.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|This is gonna be great!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Police Station, day.

We need to let the men of this town know that if they paid for sex they\'re going to jail!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Sting operation, sir?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|\'\'[turns to face his men]\'\' We need an undercover cop disguised as a prostitute, so we can arrest any citizens looking for cheap thrills!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A seedy side of town, night. Chief Yates is dressed as a hooker and is waiting curbside for a john. A car slowly rolls up, then stops.

I\'m a cop!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|Awhuh! What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|This is a sting operation, scumbag, and you\'re going to jail for soliciting prostitution. \'\'[grabs his walkie-talkie and talks into it]\'\' Got our first one, boys.

A lot of boys would pay to kiss my employees.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You didn\'t think of anything, Butters! Guys have been doing what you\'re doing for years! You\'re nothin\' but a common pimp! \'\'[slams his locker door shut and walks off with the other three boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|...A pimp. Huh...}}\n{{ScriptScene|At the newly-christened Butters Kissing Co, Ltd. in his bedroom. Butters and Sally are at his desk. Butters is researching what it is to be a pimp.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Bohy, Kyle was right, Sally. There\'s guys with kissing companies all over the country. "The person managing all the women is known as the \'pimp,\' while the working women are referred to as \'ho\' or \'bitch.\'" Oh, you\'re a bitch, Sally. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally|Oh. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey, look at this! There\'s about to be a big pimp convention, it looks like. I gotta get to that convention, Sally. I could learn all kinds of stuff for our company.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Players Ball, night.
