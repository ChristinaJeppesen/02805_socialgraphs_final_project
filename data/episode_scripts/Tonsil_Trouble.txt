Take a look. \'\'[Mitch steps in and looks into the microscope]\'\' That\'s a sample of HIV-infected blood. You can clearly see the HIV attacking the white blood cells, right? \'\'[the HIV is indeed attacking]\'\' All right. Watch what happens when we introduce some cash. \'\'[waves a brick of bills around near the microscope]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch|My God. The HIV particles are receding! \'\'[the particles scream as they sense the money, and leave the white blood cells alone]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 1|The cash does seem to retrain the HIV cells from stabilizing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 2|Now hold on! All the cash is doing is destabilizing the virus, not destroying it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well look, if being around lots of cash negatively affects the HIV, then maybe...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch|Then maybe enough cash shot directly into the bloodstream could kill the virus altogether.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Magic|I have enough cash for all three of us! We should give it a try!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 2|Na-noo, it\'s ridiculous. We need FDA approval, control studies! I\'m sorry, but this is impossible!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Magic|These boys have shown us that a lot of impossible things can happen. \'\'[genuflects next to them]\'\' Their friendship has conquered every obstacle in their illness-ridden lives.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 2|\'\'[sighs heavily and puts his hands on a lab table]\'\' Their incredible friendship has brought a sparkle of hope to our world, that\'s for sure.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[looks away]\'\' Wugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 2|I suppose we could try to distill Magic\'s cash down to its... most highly-concentrated level and... try it on one of them. But it\'s very risky.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah well, if there\'s a chance of being cured of this illness, then Kyle is willing to take that risk.}}\n{{ScriptScene|moments later, a tank holding a lot of Magic\'s dollar bills is brought in. A shredder is lowered into the tank and turned on. It shreds the bills to into pulp and then is lifted out. The tank is lifted up over a cylinder and the pulp is poured from the tank to the cylinder, which turns out to be a giant pump. The pump is activated and pushes the pulp into a helical tube. At the end of the tube is a small chamber which distills the pulp into a clear green liquid and acts as a dropper. The liquid drips into a large syringe. Once it fills up, Mitch takes it...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch|Let\'s hope to Christ this works. \'\'[...walks over to Kyle, kneels next to him, and injects him with the liquid.

Yes, take a look! \'\'[he trades places with Scientist 2, who looks into the microscope]\'\' The cash particles have completely replaced all the HIV in Kyle\'s blood! \'\'[the newly repaired blood cells look like discs cut out of dollar bills. Scientist 1 turns around and faces the boys.]\'\' Boys, you just found the cure for AIDS.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 1|\'\'[throws open the lab doors and walks out]\'\' They found the cure for AIDS! \'\'[runs down the hall]\'\' The cure for AIDS!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 3|What is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 1|\'\'[grabs Scientist 3 by the shoulders]\'\' Large doses of concentrated cash! \'\'[runs down the hall]\'\' Get the media on the phone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scientist 4|\'\'[female]\'\' All right!}}\n{{ScriptScene|SNN News}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchorman|Scientists have just discovered the cure... for AIDS. \'\'[smiles]\'\' About a hundred and eighty thousand dollars shot directly into the bloodstream.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Nigeria, Africa, around sunset.
