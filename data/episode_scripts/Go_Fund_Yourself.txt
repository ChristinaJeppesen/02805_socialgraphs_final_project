Those words mean a great deal to us. They help us express just how we as a company... see things differently.

As you know, the Redskins have been on the forefront of Kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves. And now, our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations we\'ve come up with. \'\'[An image of the office appears, with the new changes]\'\' To begin with, we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side. But we didn\'t stop there. We also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes. And probably most exciting of all, we have actually updated the company from the inside out. We received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our Redskins logo. As a company we want to be firm, but we also want to be flexible. And so we thought, if we have to change our logo, it should be more in step with today\'s times, but still define us as the leading Kickstarter company. What we came up with is the new company logo that I think you\'ll all agree is very exciting. \'\'[a pair of tits and male genitalia are added to the original logo, to much cheer and applause]\'\' Now when people hear the name "Redskins", they will immediately think "titties" and "balls".
