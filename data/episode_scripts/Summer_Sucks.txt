\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary. In the final hour of the school year...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay, children, now I know that today is the last day of school, and that the last day of school involves pranks, but this is going too far! What have you done with Mr. Hat?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids stay silent.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Children! I want Mr. Hat back, right now!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison pounds his desk in frustration.}} \n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|The prank is over!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He pounds his desk again. The kids sit still.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|You think I can\'t get along without Mr. Hat, don\'t you? You think I can\'t live without him? Well, I can! He\'s just a puppet. I don\'t need him. You see? Watch.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He starts waiting. Soon he grimaces, then he taps his thumbs together, then taps them faster.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'\'God damn it! Where the fuck did you put Mr. Hat?!\'\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|He pounds his desk hard and the apple bounces away. The dismissal bell rings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Yea--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh no, you don\'t! The school year is over, but summer vacation doesn\'t start for you little bastards until Mr. Hat is back on my desk!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Awww..!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Now, I\'m going to turn around, and when I turn back, I expect to see Mr. Hat lying right here!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison turns to face the board.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay.

The kids bolt through the school\'s front door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Yea!/Hooray!/Summer!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The snow melts away, and a mound of it reveals a boy whose missing person\'s poster was in the back of the class.

Better get some firewood ready.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He uses a chainsaw on the tree in front of the house. Trees all over the area are coming down.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A park, and kids are at play already.

Enjoy some of this summer for me, would you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What do you mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Well, I have to spend my summer in summer school, because I can\'t be left alone.

Goddamn, you suck, Pip!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys laugh at him and walk away.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys walk past a sign reading "Stu\'s Fireworks" with an arrow pointing right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh yeah, dude, it\'s summer. That means we gotta buy fireworks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I saved up enough to buy M-80s this year.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I saw in this movie once, where this guy stuck a firecracker up a cat\'s butt.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cool! Maybe we can do that to Cartman\'s cat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Eeyy! If you so much as touch Kitty\'s ass, I\'ll put firecrackers in your nutsack and blow your balls all over your pants!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Jesus, Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Mumbles.]\'\' Well, I\'m just saying na, don\'t mess with Kitty na.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stu\'s Firework Shack.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stu|Hi, fellas.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|Hi, Stu.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stu|What can I do for you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We wanna buy M-80s.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|The kind that fit in Cartman\'s cat\'s ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, that\'s it!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny laughs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Screw you guys!

Just \'cause some stupid North Park kid blew his hands off, we don\'t get to buy M-80s?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stu|Right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|How can they do this to us? Doesn\'t anyone believe in tradition anymore?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. We\'ve been playing with firecrackers our whole lives.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Flashback. Kyle remembers their days as toddlers. All four stand in a hallway holding lit firecrackers. Kyle tosses one up in the air and it pops. Kenny holds on to his, to his peril. It pops, and Kenny\'s head flies off his torso. The rest of the body falls over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh gosh, killed Kenny!|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oo bastards!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|Rats pile on the corpse and nibble away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|A summer without fireworks is like… I don\'t know, but it\'s like-- It sucks ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, now what are we supposed to do?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stu pulls out a fireworks box and takes something out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stu|I can still sell snakes.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stu lights one up, sets it down, and watches it grow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan/Kyle/ Kenny|Awww..!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Meanwhile, over at City Hall, Mayor McDaniels is on the phone with someone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|This is absurd!

We\'re ready.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What the hell are you waiting for, Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Guys? Don\'t you notice anything wrong with this picture?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. Your fat ass isn\'t on the sled!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ugh... Whatever.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He hops on.

Just \'cause some kid blew off his hands doesn\'t mean the rest of us have to suffer, now, does it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Are fireworks legal in Mexico?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Hell, everything\'s legal in México. It\'s the American way.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo drives through mountains in the distance.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at City Hall, the Mayor is holding a meeting. A man is shown with an easel and a large notebook.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|At the Dyno Might Firework Company, we have a commitment to excellence. Our focus is on safety while--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|Oh, o-kay. \'\'[To himself.]\'\' Let\'s see...}}\n{{ScriptScene|He turns the pages up and over. Page 1: Dyno Might Safe and Spicy; Section 1: Introduction; Section 2: Safety Features; Section 3: We Value the Customer... Now to design specifications.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|Now, the disk that we are making is approximately 5,000 times bigger than the average snake.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Ooooh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|We\'ll have to fly it in with three Comanche helicopters and lower it onto the ground at the lake.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|\'\'[Writes notes.]\'\' Comanche helicopters...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|\'\'[Flips page.]\'\' Then we\'ll need 57 flamethrowers, all set up around the perimeter of the disk, that are all triggered to fire at the same time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|...flamethrowers, triggered at the same time...}}\n{{ScriptScene|Charlie flips the page. A giant smiling snake is shown rising out of the disk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|Once lit, the snake will grow.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He turns the page and vaudevillian Abe Vigoda is shown.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Charlie|And good times will be had by all.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Mayor and her aides clap.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide 1|Wonderful.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide 2|Spectacular.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Well, you see? Fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever. Wait a minute! We\'re gonna need an orchestra to play \'\'The Stars and Stripes\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide 1|Hey! How about the elementary school orchestra? They had a great version of \'\'Mary Had a Little Lamb\'\' at their last concert.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Yes! Get the school principal on the phone! And we need somebody to dress up like Uncle Remus!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide 2|Uh, Mayor, I think you mean Uncle Sam?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Of course I do, you fuckin\' asshole!}}\n{{ScriptScene|On the side of a road. The boys are building a snowman, but out of mud.

Kids are swimming and diving, and a lifeguard looks over the scene. Cartman, however dips his toes into the water and shudders.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Eh-eh-eh-eh...}}\n{{ScriptScene|He backs away as the instructor blows her whistle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Instructor|Okay kids, everyone in the pool!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids jump in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|instructor|Come on, Eric, we\'re gonna start now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Nuh-uh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Instructor|Just jump in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I don\'t wanna.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Instructor|It\'s not gonna hurt ya, hon.

Oh, let\'s try some scales first. C scale first. And...}}\n{{ScriptScene|They start playing the scale (F# first), but everyone is playing out of key, creating a god-awful mix of noises.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Romero|Okay, that was pretty good. Let\'s play Mozart\'s \'\'Symphony No. 5\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|They try, but it is yet another god-awful mix of noises.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Oh, we\'re doomed. Our Fourth of July celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tone-deaf little shits playing.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She see something.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Wait a minute... It\'s the snake!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The snake appears over the mountain transported by the three Comanche helicopters. Everyone stops to watch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Let\'s move along, people. If you\'ve seen one giant snake-thingy firework, you\'ve seen them all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Call everybody! The show\'s back on!

Aagghh! Aggh!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison approaches, and with a small ax, chops off Lamb Chop from Shari\'s hand and tosses it onto a lit barbecue grill.

It burns..!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison is shown smiling away on his armchair, having dreamed out his anger.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Meanwhile, over at the Community Pool.
