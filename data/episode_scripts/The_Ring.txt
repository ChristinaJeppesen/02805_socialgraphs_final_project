And that\'s because little girls are fucking stupid! Haha. And the purity rings make it okay to do whatever I want! Haha. Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I\'m selling sex to their daughters! I\'ve made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now, haha! And do you know why?! \'\'[Cartman sees the curtain control button and presses it. The curtain rises revealing Mickey Mouse to the audience]\'\' Because Christians are retard-ed!
