I\'ve heard some of you express concern over current events, so I think we should discuss what\'s happening. It is true – Rick and I did get into a fight over the weekend. \'\'[the class is silent]\'\' Now, I don\'t know what you\'ve heard and what you haven\'t, but Rick was wrong, okay? He\'s the one that needs to apologize.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|We\'re not worried about that, we\'re all worried about Putin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Putin? It was just a little noise when I pulled out. Nobody was "pootin", okay? And anyway, you kids shouldn\'t be talking about that kind of stuff!

We\'re doing an emergency drill this morning, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|A drill?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay, now, we haven\'t done these in a long time, but we need to be prepared if the Russians decide to nuke us. Now, when you hear this sound...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[on the intercom]\'\' The Russians are nuking us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|...then you need to quickly and calmly get out of your seats and get to the gymnasium, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[intercom]\'\' The Russians are nuking us. \'\'[For a few moments, the classroom is silent and they all look confused....]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[loudly]\'\' The Russians are fucking nuking us!

Everyone\'s going to die!}}\n{{ScriptScene|All the kids get under the gymnasium bleachers and the screaming stops. A kid sneaks his head out to check outside of the bleachers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay. That was... 22 seconds. That\'s not bad, m\'kay. Now, if this were real, we would just all stay here and wait to hear from our government and maybe, maybe listen to some appropriate music.

We\'ve got a big competition this weekend, so let\'s line up and do our rails.}}\n{{ScriptScene|All the kids begin to prepare for practice. Butters approaches Linda and Stephen who are watching him from a distance.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Don\'t wave at us, Butters! \'\'[to Linda]\'\' Judges hate when they wave. He needs to not do that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dressage Instructor|Okay, Staci Mae, nice trot. Here comes the jump. \'\'[the horse successfully makes the jump]\'\' Good! Very nice. Okay, next. \'\'[next one makes the jump as well]\'\' Good, Heather. That\'s good control of Sunshine. Good. Okay, Butters. Come on, you\'re next.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Come on, Butters. Come on! \'\'[Butters\' horse barely makes the jump and pole clunks slightly]\'\' Oh! He clunked it! It\'s okay... It\'s okay. Good job, Butters. Good job.

That\'s Dan Solokov\'s kid! Dan Solokov? Who works at the Ace Hardware over in Meeker? Even the kid\'s pony is a Russian Etruscan! \'\'[turns to Solokov\'s kid]\'\' You piece-a-shit communist! You won\'t take our freedoms away! Boo, Russia!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Mackey\'s office. He is sitting back in his office chair as he listens to music. He seems to be immersed in the song.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Music|\'\'Games without frontiers...\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr.Mackey|\'\'[singing along]\'\' "War without tears... Jeux sans frontiers..." \'\'[a knock is heard] \'\'Yeah?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The door opens.

We are going to be prepared.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Well, Mr. Mackey, this is the seventh drill that we\'ve done in two days. And I see that you also put in the budget for a bomb shelter and 20 VHS copies of "Red Dawn".}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|VHS is still really the best format when you think about it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Mr. Mackey, I\'m starting to worry that this is sort of... nostalgic for you, like you\'re kind of enjoying this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[looking angry]\'\' Enjoying it? My job is to have this school ready. Kids need to know what Russia is capable of. Оставь меня в покое (Leave me alone).}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|\'\'[raising an eyebrow]\'\' You speak Russian?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|No, but I\'ve watched \'\'Hunt For Red October\'\' like 200 times.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Mr. Mackey, I am not asking you. I\'m telling you – stop with all the drills and stop putting ideas into our students\' heads.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|No, you – you\'re right, of course. I\'m – I\'m over-reacting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay...}}\n{{ScriptScene|PC Principal leaves and mysterious music begins to play. Mr. Mackey checks to see if the coast is clear and makes his way out of his office. He passes by Mr. Adler and quickly enters PC Principal\'s office. Once he is inside, Mr. Mackey rummages through the office, hoping to find intel on PC Principal. He opens a file cabinet and snaps pictures of various files.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Equestrian Facility. Another day of practice is under way. Butters and his parents walk in with Melancholy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Alright, Butters, you\'ve just got two more days before the dressage competition.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I\'ll do my best, Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|You\'re gonna have to do better than that, Butters. You see that little Russian kid over there? \'\'[he points at Solokov\'s kid]\'\' That kid doesn\'t give a shit about you. He just wants to win and take what little patriotism our country has left.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That kid?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|You didn\'t live through the Cold War, Butters, but we did. This tournament is going to be turned into a political spectacle, and we have to win. Otherwise, I\'m afraid we\'ll have to give your pony away to communists who slaughter ponies and donkeys to make skin cream. That\'s mostly the Chinese, but a commie\'s a commie.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|Better dead than red, Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, Jesus! Not Melancholy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Now, that little prick is trying to intimidate you. I want you to go in there and show him how an American rides!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[he clicks his tongue]\'\' Come on, boy! \'\'[Melancholy stops and begins pooping on the floor]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Butters! Butters, what the hell are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, I dunno!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|You have to learn to control!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[tongue clicking]\'\' Come on, Melancholy, come on! \'\'[A slide whistle is heard and Melancholy gets a boner]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girls|Ewwww!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Butters, what the hell is that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|What is what? \'\'[he looks down]\'\' Oh, geez! Put that thing away, Melancholy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|\'\'[softly]\'\' Jesus, Linda, what are we gonna do?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr Mackey\'s office. Mr. Mackey is looking through images of PC Principal in the hopes to find something that could deem suspicious. He takes notes as he does so.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|What are you up to, you piece of shit?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Moments later, Butters comes inside his office, looking down a bit sadly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hello, sir. I just needed to talk to somebody. I\'ve been having some problems at home.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[disinterested]\'\' Uh-huh, m\'kay, that\'s nice. That\'s good to hear. Why don\'t you just, uh, sit there and tell me about it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, it\'s just my parents. You see, a few months ago, I saw this little girl riding a pony and I said, "Whoa! I wanna do that!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Uh huh...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|So we found a stable and a trainer, and I started to learn dressage. And I got to lease a pony, and his name is Melancholy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yeah. Yeah, that must be tough. I\'m sorry to hear that, m\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, I love to ride Melancholy. But now I\'m feeling all this pressure to win. My parents said I have to win because it\'s against the Russians.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay, we – the what? \'\'[menacing music plays]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|It\'s the Russians. I mean, I guess they\'re just really good at dressage, but now my dad says it\'s a matter of national security.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay. Butters. Don\'t move your head.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Don\'t move my head? I –}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Uh, uh! They\'re probably watching us, so keep acting like you\'re asking me for help.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, o-okay, but I kind of am asking you for help, ya know, because I\'m feeling really lost and miserable.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|That\'s good. Now listen carefully. What did your parents tell you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, they said if I don\'t do well at dressage, it could mean the end of all of our freedoms.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Jesus Christ... M\'kay! Well, Butters, you know sometimes troubles at home can be bad, m\'kay. \'\'[he kneels next to Butters and whispers to him]\'\' I need you to tell me everything you know about dressage.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Equestrian Facility, the next day. Butters walks with Melancholy on the track.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|We need to have a serious talk, Melancholy, and I need you to listen. \'\'[he stops walking and turns to look at Melancholy]\'\' There\'s a time to poop, and there\'s a time to work. And the best thing is to poop when your work is done. I-It\'s like when I\'m in the classroom, sometimes I have to poop, but I have to wait until lunch break. If I really have to go, I can raise my hand and ask politely. But if you start to poop while we\'re competin\', the judges are gonna deduct points. And then the Russians will beat us, and then you\'re gonna get turned into Chinese skin cream! \'\'[he approaches Melancholy to pet him]\'\' We have to do this, Melancholy. You and me have to focus like never before. Now, let\'s go show them what we can do! \'\'[he gets on the horse saddle with a look of determination on his face]\'\' Let\'s go! \'\'[he clicks his tongue]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Uplifting music begins to play as Butters rides through the track. He smiles.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That\'s it! You got it, boy!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Abruptly, the music ends and Melancholy stops to poop on the floor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Nope! Nope! Melancholy! Over the jump, boy! \'\'[he attempts to make Melancholy go forward, but no luck]\'\' Come on, Melancholy! \'\'[Melancholy begins to trot away]\'\' What? W-Where are you going? \'\'[Butters tries to gain control of Melancholy]\'\' Melancholy, back to the jump! Whoa, Melancholy, Whoa!! W-What are you doing now?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Melancholy approaches another horse, and a blow whistle sound is heard again. Melancholy jumps on the horse, and...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Now I\'m not sure what\'s going on here. \'\'[the girl on the other horse screams as this continues on]\'\' No! No! No! Melancholy! Bad pony! I\'m sorry, ma\'am! Melancholy, to the jump!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A shot of icy mountains, the camera pans to the Solokov\'s house while Russia\'s National Anthem plays. The montage shows scenes of Davey practicing dressage in his backyard, as well as him and his parents eating, until Mr. Mackey shows up in the window.}}\n{{ScriptScene|<poem><i>Россия - священная наша держава,\nRossiya - svyashchennaya nasha derzhava,\n\nРоссия - любимая наша страна.\nRossiya - lyubimaya nasha strana.\n\nМогучая воля, великая слава -\nMoguchaya volya, velikaya slava -\n\nТвое достоянье на все времена!\nTvoye dostoyan\'ye na vse vremena!\n\nСлавься, Отечество наше свободное,\nSlav\'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,\n\nБратских народов союз вековой,\nBratskikh narodov soyuz vekovoy,\n\nПредками данная мудрость народная!\nPredkami dannaya mudrost\' narodnaya!</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|80\'s music plays, Mr. Mackey stealthily walks towards the stable where Davey\'s horse is.
