The arcade is on the second floor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, this place shreds! What should we do first?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|We should get back to Pioneer Village, that\'s what we should do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters, we\'re going to get back before anybody even notices we\'re gone.

All right, come on. \'\'[they leave Super Phun Thyme]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Pioneer Village, later. The leader of the gunmen barks orders into a walkie talkie and paces back and forth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leader|Set up the satellite relay, check for alternate routes out of the area. \'\'[turns to the hostage group]\'\' Unfortunately, your police department got wind of our robbery and chased after us.

This is the man who is going to kill an entire class of fourth graders if he doesn\'t get exactly what he wants!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outdoors in Pioneer Village.

I don\'t wanna get in trouble! And I didn\'t have a super fun time anyways.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters, you\'ve gotta learn to chill. Life goes by pretty fast.

The leader gives more commands as he walks along.

There\'s no way we\'re gettin\' out above ground without being spotted.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leader|Above ground?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Orlich|Look, I found this at the rear of the park. It\'s an old mine shaft, \'\'[a picture of an abandoned gold mine appears]\'\' but Pioneer Village was sued when a kid died in it, so they closed it down and protected it with a huge me\'al door with a coded lock.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leader|So if we can get into the shaft we can tunnel our way around the police.
