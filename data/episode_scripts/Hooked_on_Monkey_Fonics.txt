He can be out here all night on the flagpole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|That\'s the point, buttpipe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t call me a buttpipe, buttpipe!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wewell, come on.

Public schools may be a bit lacking in education, but it\'s the main place where children learn all of their social skills. You can\'t teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves. And the only place to do that is on the playground, in the cafeteria, and so on. \'\'[his parents listen]\'\' Don\'t you see, papá? That\'s what happened to your daughter.
