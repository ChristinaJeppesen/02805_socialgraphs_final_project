Oh, it burns!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Okay, Chip. You might need to ease up on that crack there, buddy. \'\'[Chip drops the book and screams, and begins to transform into an actual witch.

Chip flies over the town and past South Park Elementary, where the parent/teacher conference is being held.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chip|I\'ll kill you all! Kill you all!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Community Center, moments later. Chip flies up cackling and begins lobbing flaming jack-o-lanterns at the adults there. One of them crashes into the parking lot and throws off a few people with its impact. Another one hits a car, stopping it in its tracks and wrecking it. The passengers get knocked out from the impact. Everyone else tries to disperse, screaming.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chip|\'\'[cackling]\'\' You\'ll all be dead by Halloween! \'\'[cackles some more]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Dr. Spooky\'s Pumpkin Patch.

I missed it! I missed it all! \'\'[Heidi pulls him away. Chip sees a boy, plucks him off the ground and carries him away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, next day. Randy comes down the stairs quite beat from the might before, goes to the fridge, gets out a gallon of fruit punch, and drinks straight from it, sighing with satisfaction. He turns and notices Sharon with her arms crossed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh. Hey, didn\'t see you there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Did you hear anything about what happened last night?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Uuuhhh, nnno, what happened?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Your buddy, Chip Duncan? \'\'[holds up her phone, on which there\'s a news report about it]\'\' Apparently, he flew around on a broom, blew things up, and kidnapped some children?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Are you serious?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|You heard nothing about this?!

The core group of boys is at table eating lunch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Did any of you guys actually see the witch?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Yeah, it was terrifying. She had a broom and a cackle and everything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|What are we gonna do, guys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Our parents are never gonna let us trick or treat with a flying witch around! \'\'[next to him, Cartman has an angry glare on his face]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|They say she blew up the pumpkin patch. Did any of you guys see that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, I missed the whole thing. I always try to get to the pumpkin patch really early.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, I got there really early too. You get the best pumpkins that way. Anyways, I guess the witch destroyed the whole thing. \'\'[the camera begins to focus on Cartman\'s glare]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'ve got to take matters into our own hands. None of us is safe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, but what are we gonna do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, we\'ve got to just hope the police will handle it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, right. Like they\'ll handle anything. \'\'[from a nearby table, Heidi peeks past Bebe and smiles at Cartman, waving at him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Stan\'s right. This might fall on us. \'\'[Cartman waves back, his glare fixed on her]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, we\'ve got to save Halloween. Don\'t you think so, Eric?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[his concentration is broken]\'\' What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|We\'ve got to do something to get rid of her!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes.

It\'s Day 2 of Witch Week with the guys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[stands up]\'\' You can\'t possibly be considering doing this again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Why not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy, a real witch is flying around in the skies snatching children! I don\'t think this is the best time for you to be wearing a witch costume and partying!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Wugh! Gau! Just because of one bad witch we\'re supposed to stop a tradition that goes back twenty-someodd years?! Jesus! \'\'[turns around and walks out the front door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Gerald\'s car. Randy walks to it and enters. The mood is subdued due to the flying witch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Hey Randy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Sup guys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|You know, just getting a bunch of shit for being witches.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I know, right? It\'s like, there\'s one awful witch who wants to kill everybody, so now they\'re coming after all of us.

The cars pull into the same lot as before, but now a sign is shown: Sentinel Hill park, which is closed. The men get out of their cars and walk up to another sign posted on an orange barricade.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Hey, what the hell is this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[reading the sign]\'\' "Park closed until further notice". That\'s bullshit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Oh my God.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|They can\'t do this! The whole town really is on a witch pursuit thing!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, night.

Stan, Kenny, and Butters stand behind him looking at the screen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Check this out, you guys. It says that to destroy a witch you need bent pits, nine in all, each bent into an L shape.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What are bent pits? \'\'[Cartman walks in with some plans]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey guys, I think I got it figured out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I knew Eric would come up with a plan! \'\'[Cartman puts up a drawing of his plan, which involves the boys luring Heidi to her death, burying the body, and celebrating her death with a pizza. He then brings out his retractable pointer and starts pointing]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, first of all, we need a scary place to lure her into. What is the creepiest place in town?

It\'s impossible!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Heidi is a nice girl! How could you be so awful to her?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You don\'t understand! She has no time-management skills whatsoever! You don\'t know \'cause you\'ve never had a girlfriend, Kyle! \'\'[Kyle just stares angrily at him]\'\' Fine. Just leave me to suffer.

Or did we close our eyes to what Chip Duncan was becoming?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Stephen, you can\'t turn on your own kind. That\'s what these witch pursuit thingies do, okay?
