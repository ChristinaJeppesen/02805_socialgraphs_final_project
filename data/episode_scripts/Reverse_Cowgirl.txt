Betsy\'s corpse in the coffin is seen with a heavy make-up and a pink dress, yet still stuck in the toilet.]\'\' What a tragedy she had to leave us so soon. But I\'m sure Betsy is hoping that her death will help women everywhere, just take that extra second to look before they sit on a toilet. \'\'[Sharon and Sheila look at each other in disbelief.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|I\'d like to say on behalf of the departed, that it isn\'t a woman\'s responsibility to see that the seat is down.

That\'s right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man With Grey Hair|\'\'[reads from a paper]\'\' Putting the toilet seat down isn\'t that hard. So is it too much to ask women to just look and put it down before they go plopping their butts blindly to the toilet bowl?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman With Brown Hair|My God, people. This is a funeral! Please have some respect! There\'s a little boy here who has lost his mother! \'\'[Clyde is shown, looking down in sorrow]\'\' He\'ll never see her again, because he couldn\'t take that sixth-tenths of a second to put the seat down when he was done peeing. \'\'[camera shows the woman again]\'\' And now little Clyde\'s mother is dead, and the blood is on his penis. \'\'[organ music is played]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Cartman house, day.

Okay, we wanna help him sue whoever invented the toilet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Attorney|You got it. \'\'[types on his computer]\'\' Here we go, the inventor of the toilet. \'\'[the camera shows the webpage he\'s reading, which turns out to be a Wickie page]\'\' Sir Thomas Harrington.
