That\'s it! Fellas, get me a Ken doll and some Scotch tape. \'\'[as the boys do this, Jimmy approaches Funnybot]\'\' Funnybot, I\'ve been talking it over with the fellas and actually, we think what you\'re doing is genius.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Funnybot|Funnybot is simply pushing the limits of comedy}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Yes, you certainly are. And for doing that, we have all decided to give you... a comedy award.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Funnybot|For what purpose is comedy award?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|It\'s a- v- validation of all your efforts. An acknowledgement of all you do in the pursuit of humor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Funnybot|Non sequitur. There is no logic in comedy award. Unable to process. Comedy award is- what is the meaning? If I accept it means I take comedy seriously. If I take comedy seriously, I am not comedian. Non sequitur. Must... analyze... \'\'[begins to tremble under the power of his own analysis]\'\' Analyze... \'\'[smoke and arcs of electricity emerge and move around the robot]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s working! \'\'[clenches fists in anticipation]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Funnybot|Explain comedy award! Unable to process! Awkwaaard! \'\'[his head begins to spin violently]\'\' Awkwaaard! \'\'[his head stops spinning and he shuts down]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That\'s it! Hurry! Gooo! \'\'[he and Kyle move towards Funnybot with huge antigravs and clamp them onto Funnybot]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|A sunny day at an undisclosed mine. The boys arrive with a massive box and run towards a waiting crowd}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay we got it! We got it! \'\'[the box must contain what the comedians wanted from the boys - Funnybot]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Adam Sandler|Get it to the platform! Hurry!}}\n{{ScriptScene|the boys haul the box onto a waiting platform, where some construction workers guide it into place. The Germans are also present, and President Wulff barks out an order. The platform rises to reveal that it will be part of a giant ball of steel surrounding the box. Two other lifts bring in other parts of the ball to complete it. Two halves of a concrete block come in and seal the ball, and two halves of an even bigger steel ball come in to seal the box. Then a crane lifts the ball up and carries it to a hole a hundred feet wide and who knows how deep, and drops it in. Once it hits bottom, three open pipes fill with cement and direct it to the hole, which fills up with cement almost to the rim}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Adam Sandler|Well, that does it. Things can finally get back to normal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, I\'m sure glad that\'s over with.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Funnybot|Thank you boys for teaching me that comedy and logic do not go together.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No problem, Funnybot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Funnybot|I understand now that comedy should be left to the imperfect biological beings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[walks to the rim and looks down]\'\' I can\'t believe it\'s finally over. \'\'[the camera goes deep into the ground and locates the ball, and something in it knocks three times]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tyler Perry|\'\'[inside the ball]\'\' Oh Lerrrd, somebody turn on the light. What\'s goin\' on? Hellowwer!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|President Obama|I am please to announce that the greatest threat to mankind is now gone forever. Justice has been done.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Thanks, everyone. Please tell me that you\'ll never do that again, Jimmy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Don\'t worry, fellas. I learned my lesson. I promise: there\'s not gonna be any comedy awards next year!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[cryptically]\'\' Or will there be?}}\n}}\n{{episodemedia15|episode=02}}\n[[zh:搞笑机器人/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Fifteen]]'}]}}}}
