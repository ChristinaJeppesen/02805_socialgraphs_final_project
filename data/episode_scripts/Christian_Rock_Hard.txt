I love him so much. Jesus is great." Cartman playing his changes on the reel-to-reel player to his band-mates.

I have never in my life done anything just for the money! If I\'m lying may the Lord strike me down right now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[slowly moves away]\'\' Uhm, oh. \'\'[leaves his chair]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Executive 1|That\'s- all we needed to know.

Maybe we\'re just, not cut out to be in a band.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You guys, we can\'t give up on our dreams now! As soon as this strike ends, we\'re gonna be the biggest band ever!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lars|Yeah, if we all give in now, people might \'\'never\'\' stop downloading our music for free!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'m sure we\'re gonna get word any minute that people have agreed to stop. \'\'[a vehicle is heard pulling up.

Cartman got a platinum album.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Is this for real?? This is for real!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He beat us. Because all this time we\'ve been so caught up with how to protect our music that we forgot to just play.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lars|But why play if we\'re not gonna make millions of dollars?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[turns around and addresses the crowd]\'\' Because that\'s what real artists do. People are always gonna find a way to copy our music and swap it for free. If we\'re real musicians, then we should just play and be stoked that so many people are listening.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[joins Kyle and faces the crowd]\'\' Besides, maybe our songs would have gotten downloaded for free, but if they were good songs then people still would have bought tickets to see our band in concert. \'\'[shots of Rick James, Ozzy, Britney and two other acts.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|From now on, MOOP isn\'t about money.

Dude, what are you gonna do about your bet with Cartman? Are you- gonna pay \'im?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I don\'t have a choice, dude.

Congratulations!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ha! Our bet was that you would get a platinum album, not a myrrh album! I don\'t owe you anything, fat boy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You mean to tell me I can never get a platinum album with a Christian rock band?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Collins|No, but you can go double myrrh. \'\'[Kyle walks off and Cartman gets pissed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|GOD DAMMIT!! \'\'[throws his plaque onto the ground, where it shatters.

You lost the entire audience!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ah, fuck you, Tolkien! You black asshole!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tolkien has had enough of that. He smacks Cartman with a left fist, a right fist, and a kick to the head. Cartman is laid out on his back and Tolkien walks away. Cartman rises, but ends up on all fours coughing. A shot of Stan, Kyle, and Kenny. They turn to leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hm. Guess he got what he deserved.}}\n{{ScriptScene|They walk away, leaving Butters. Cartman is still coughing and Butters is unsure what to do. He rubs his fists past each other tentatively.
