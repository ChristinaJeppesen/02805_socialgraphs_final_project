Throughout this whole ordeal, we\'ve all wanted to show things that we weren\'t allowed to show. But it wasn\'t because of some magic goo. It was because of the magical power of threatening people with violence. That\'s obviously the only \'\'true\'\' power. If there\'s anything we\'ve all learned, it\'s that terrorizing people works.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|That\'s right. Don\'t you see, gingers? If you don\'t want to be made fun of anymore, all you need are guns and bombs to get people to stop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Santa|That\'s right, friends. All you need to do is instill fear, and be willing to hurt people, and you can get whatever you want. The only true power is violence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[smiles and tilts his head to one side]\'\' Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, day. Reconstruction on the town begins}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Alright, people, let\'s start rebuilding our town! For the 39th time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, dude, look. \'\'[Cartman is shown on a gurney, crying. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach him]\'\' Hey, Cartman...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Look, man, w-we know what you learned was pretty tough to hear.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Tough to hear? My dad was Scott Tenorman\'s dad. Don\'t you guys realize what that means?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, dude, we, we know what it means.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|My dad was a ginger!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wwait, what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I mean, obviously, I take after my mom, but I have the ginger gene inside of me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, you killed your own dad, and you\'re worried about that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|\'\'[appears]\'\' Hey, Eric, Eric!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|Come on, cheer up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Cheer up? I\'m half ginger!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|Yeah, but you\'re forgetting, you\'re also half Denver Bronco. That makes you pretty cool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey, you\'re right. That \'\'does\'\' make me pretty cool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You gotta be kidding me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|Shut up, Kyle, you dumb Jew. \'\'[to Cartman]\'\' You\'ve got Bronco blood in you, kid. That makes you awesome. Me? I should be movin\' on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Really, Mitch? Ya, you\'ve gotta go?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|There\'s a bounty on my head and I can\'t afford to stay in one place for too long. So long... Denver Bronco.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Take it easy, Conner. \'\'[his hand floats away, then opens up all of a sudden. He wiggles his fingers. Next shot is of Tom Cruise sitting by himself on a trash can.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, Mr. Cruise, I\'m sorry I said you were a fudge packer and that you had Seaman on your back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|I just... can\'t do it anymore. I wanna go away. But there\'s nowhere on earth that people aren\'t around to rip on me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey... Hey, we know a place! We know a place where everything is just happiness and joy. And no humans are there to mess it up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We do? Oh, oh, yeah, we do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|You... really? Somewhere where I can just ...live out my days in peace and quiet and- Oh. \'\'[stands up]\'\' Oh, please, can you show me where?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'ll do better than that. We\'ll help you get there.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The moon. Tom Cruise is shown laying next to Willzyx.}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia14|episode=06}}\n[[zh:第201集/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Fourteen]]'}]}}}}
