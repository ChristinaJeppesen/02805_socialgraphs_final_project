Then we must look for them elsewhere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Come on, man. What is this all about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|If Barbra Streisand saw the same report I did, then those boys are in grave danger.

Everything must be handled \'\'very\'\' carefully.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She goes to some bookshelves and pulls on a book, on the top of which is a secret button.

For so long I have waited to find the other triangle, and now I am so close. The Dawn of Zinthar is close at hand!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She laughs rather hysterically.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle\'s bedroom. He\'s asleep. A model of the solar system, a picture of him and his elephant, and the Triangle of Zinthar can be seen on his dresser. The camera pans up to see a saw cutting through the ceiling. The hole is made and the cut piece is pushed unto the floor. Kyle flinches and turns around, now facing the wall. A rope comes down and footfalls are heard. Kyle adjusts himself. A pair of eyes looks around and sees the triangle, then Kyle, then back to the triangle. The eyes approach and two hands reach out to grab the triangle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|Cokeshen.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman is distracted, knocking down the picture, waking up Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Revealing himself.]\'\' You scared the \'\'crap\'\' out of me, Ike!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What the hell are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'I\'m trying to get my tri\'\'- wait a minute, I\'m not talking to you.

Here!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle hands him the triangle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There. Now, get out of my house! And I hope you feel \'\'really, really good\'\' about yourself!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman looks at the triangle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hell, yeah I do, I got the triangle. <poem><i>I got the triangle,\nI got the triangle,\ndee dun dee dun</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|He backs up and goes out the door. Kyle goes back to sleep. Meanwhile, in Chef\'s Town and Country, He and Maltin are driving around.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|Are you sure Barbra Streisand has a condo up here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|It was \'\'just a rumor.\'\' A lot of big celebrities have mountain condos.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|Then we\'ve got to keep looking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|\'\'[Braking hard.]\'\' Alright. Leonard Maltin, this has gone far enough! I ain\'t drivin\' another mile until you tell me what this is all about!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|Haven\'t you ever been curious about the insanity Barbra Streisand exhibits?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, I always heard she was kind of a bitch, but-.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|More than a bitch! She\'s a calculating, self-centered egotistical bitch! She was born in a small town, her mother was a jackal, and her father was an insurance salesman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Woohoohoohoo. An insurance salesman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|When she was five, she knew that she wanted to be a famous singer, but by the time she was six, her ambitions became to rule the universe. She learned of an ancient diamond, the Diamond of Pantheos.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Okay. You know what? Never mind, I don\'t need to know all this!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Starts up the station wagon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Forget I asked!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|Before she was seven the keepers of Pantheos learned of this insane little girl\'s wish. The diamond was split up, and buried at opposite ends of the world. But then, during the shooting of \'\'\'My Fair Lady\'\'\', Barbra Streisand found one of the triangles.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|And the other triangle is the one that little Kyle has?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leonard Maltin|Yes, Mr. Chef. If Babs gets a hold of that other triangle, she will fulfill her prophecy, and become the most threatening thing ever known to mankind. Mecha-Streisand!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|\'\'Mega\'\'-Streisand? Oh, man, I don\'t know what the hell \'\'that\'\' means, but it doesn\'t sound good.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bus stop, Monday.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Man, the bus sure is late.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hmmm. I wonder what I should do with \'\'my\'\' triangle, now that it is \'\'mmyy\'\' triangle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dammit Cartman! I gave it to you so you would \'\'shut... up\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Barbra Streisand pulls up in her car wearing a Groucho Marx face mask, and steps out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|Oh, hello there, little boys. How are you today?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|That is great. My name is Mrs. Jones, and I am a very friendly, nice person.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The four boys stand silent.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|I hear that one of you found my triangle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'Your\'\' triangle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|Yes. You see, that triangle is part of my kidney dialysis machine. I\'m so glad you found it, because without it I was sure to die within hours.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh no you don\'t! Finders Keepers!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|But I\'ll \'\'die\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, I guess we\'ll have to ro-sham-bo for it. I\'ll kick you in the nuts as hard as I can, then you kick me square in the nuts as hard as \'\'you\'\' can...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|I want to give you a big cash reward for \'\'finding\'\' it. It\'s worth a lot of money to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It is?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey, no wonder that Barbra Streisand lady wanted it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|Oooh, hahahah. Who is that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, just this \'\'really really\'\' old lady who wishes she was still only 45.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys laugh and Barbra seethes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, and you should have seen her nose. It was big enough to land stealth bombers on.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys laugh again and Barbra gets angrier.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeeh, stealth bombers.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys laughs some more.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, and talk about a bitch, I haven\'t seen-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|ENOUGH!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys are suddenly horrified.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbra Streisand|Oh, Haa-ha. Anyway, if you\'ll come with me in my car, I\'ll take you up to my condo where I\'ll kill you - I I mean-uh, uh give you - money - for the triangle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sweet! I\'m gonna be rich. Bet you wish you hadn\'t given me that triangle back now, huh, Kyle? Dumbass!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Heads for the car.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wait. Isn\'t there some rule about not getting into cars with strangers?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, not when money is involved, stupid!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids climb into her car and Barbra revs it up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fanfare.
