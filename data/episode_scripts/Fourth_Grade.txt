\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, morning. The school bell rings. A "WELCOME BACK!" sign hangs over a row of student lockers as kids mill around in the hall.

Or we could just show our asses.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, so it\'s decided.

I had already forgotten how great third grade was.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Huh-it sure was.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[wistfully]\'\' I wish I was still there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey, that\'s it! We gotta go back to third grade!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|How?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[a bit dramatic]\'\' We travel back in time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh yeah, time travel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oowuh how are we gonna do that? Does it hurt? \'\'[waves the suggestion off]\'\' I don\'t wanna do it if it hurts. Or if it... makes you get all sticky.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It can\'t be \'\'that\'\' bad. People do it on TV all the time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, we just \'\'have\'\' to find somebody who knows \'\'how\'\' to do it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, what about those two college guys next door to me? They\'re always doing science experiments in their basement.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, if there\'s a way to travel back in time, those two dorks will know how!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The basement of the two college guys, after school. These are computer geeks, with at least three computers in there. The blond guy works on his nose as he talks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|When it comes to time-traveling theory, there are basically two school of thought. The Spock Theory is that a sling shot around the sun could create a wormhole in which time could not escape. The Lieutenant Commander Data Theory, however, is that a nag vibration could create a rip in the time-space continuum-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Look, whatever it takes, we just have to get back to third grade.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|Time-travel is no laughing matter. Four times the Enterprise went back in time, and four times they almost didn\'t make it back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We don\'t \'\'want\'\' to make it back, we want to \'\'stay\'\' there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|So can you do it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|It\'s all theoretical, but from a scientific standpoint, the creation of a rip in space-time \'\'is\'\' possible.

For the future of our children!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|...Two hundred bucks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|...Done.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The basement of the two college guys, after school. The boys show up again. Much of the stuff that was in the basement is gone. Soon, it is shown that the second nerd has moved out}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude! You gotta build us another time machine!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|Huh? Oh... Can\'t.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What do you mean, "can\'t"?! You made it work; just build us another one!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|I can\'t, because pizza-face isn\'t here! We\'re not on speaking terms! We got in a big fight and he moved all his stuff out!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|W-what did you get in a fight about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|There\'s 73 original Star Treks! He keeps saying there\'s 72!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, Jesus Christ! You\'ve got to be kidding me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|No! He actually thinks there\'s 72.!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Look, dude, can\'t you just build us another machine without him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #1|No. Pizza-face took all his equipment home to his mom\'s. Now, if you can go over there and get him to admit that he\'s \'\'wrong\'\'...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright, come on, guys. \'\'[the boys exit the basement and head up the stairs]\'\' Man, I can\'t believe we have to do this while Timmy\'s already back in time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah! Timmy\'s probably back in third grade right now living it up!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A tropical forest. Dinosaurs roam this land. A Pteranodon flies overhead as a triceratops chases Timmy}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Timmy|Timmah! Timmaaaaahhh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, the "Matterhorn," the plateau outside Garrison\'s cave. Mr. Garrison walks around Ms. Choksondik as she balances three books on each hand and one on her head while standing on only her left foot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Alright, let\'s try it again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|"Children, we are now going to do math problems."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|"But teacher, I don\'t want to do my math problems."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|"Uuh! Ah, you \'\'will\'\' do them or else you\'ll be in very big trouble!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|"Well, I\'m not \'\'gong\' \'\' to do it, teacher! You can just suck my balls!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|"Don\'t use that kind of language, young man!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|NOOO!\'\'[Ms. Choksondik drops the books in terror]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|\'\'[drops the books in terror]\'\' No??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Look, you can\'t counter a profane command with an idle threat! You must extinguish it with a vulgar suggestion! When a child says, "Suck my balls," you say, "Present them."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Now, let\'s try it again. \'\'[gathers the books up and repositions them on Ms. Choksondik\'s hands and head, then stands to her left.

I\'m not afraid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[ominously, gruffly]\'\' You will be! You will be! \'\'[coughs]\'\' You will be.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, a house. Eight boys approach it: Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Butters, Kevin, Tolkien, Tweek, and Clyde. Stan knocks}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|God-damnit, this is ridiculous.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|\'\'[opens the door angrily]\'\' What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, can you \'\'please\'\' just stop fighting with your friend and build another machine so we can travel back in time to the third grade?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|Look! There aren\'t 73 episodes of Star Trek, there are 72! "The Menagerie" was a 2-parter that counts as one episode! Pizza-face is wrong!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Who the hell cares?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|I know! Why does he have to be such a dick about it?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wouldn\'t it be better to just agree with him and forget the whole thing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|No, because he\'s WRONG!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Look. You guys built a machine together that can bend time. If you\'ll just agree with him, you can build another one and usher in a whole new era of science!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|And live in a world of 72 original Star Treks? I don\'t think so!

They don\'t even realize that "The Menagerie" originally \'\'was\'\' the pilot and \'\'later\'\' got split up into two episodes, eh ha ha.

I\'ve \'\'got\'\' it. \'\'[knocks again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|\'\'[opens the door angrily]\'\' What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, if you guys build another time machine, you can travel back in time and ask the creator of Star Trek how many episodes there \'\'were!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nerd #2|\'\'[thinks for a moment]\'\' Dude, Jesus, you\'re right.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, the "Matterhorn."

I wouldn\'t go in there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Oh, alrighty. \'\'[enters the base of the tree and through the hewn hallway, then sees a light at the other end.]\'\' What the? Why there\'s nothing in here but an exit to the other side! \'\'[peers through it, then pulls back]\'\' There\'s nothing in here at all. ...Oh, and I actually thought my mental demons would be in here. \'\'[thinks for a moment]\'\' Wait a minute. Maybe there\'s not sup\'\'posed\'\' to be anything in here. Maybe I\'m supposed to see that I alone \'\'do\'\' have the strength to reach the kids! \'\'[clenches her fists]\'\' I think I get it now! \'\'[walks out the other end]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[bides his time and sighs]\'\' Hey, hurry up in there! \'\'[under his breath]\'\' Jesus. \'\'[knocks on the tree entrance]\'\' You\'re taking too long in the damn Tree of Insight! \'\'[looks at the entrance, then looks in]\'\' You in there?! \'\'[enters the hallway himself]\'\' Hey, where the hell did she go? \'\'[a few more steps, and rumbling begins]\'\' What the? \'\'[the entrance closes and a mirror Garrison, clean-shaven, appears.

You can\'t be!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clean Garrison|It is me, your darkest fear. Your gay self, incarnate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Unkempt Garrison|What do you want?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clean Garrison|I want you to not fight me anymore.
