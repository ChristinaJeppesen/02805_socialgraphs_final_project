And from the damage to his head area, it appears he was also given a swirly, a colossal one. \'\'[the boys are more frightened after hearing this]\'\' It also looks like he received a noogie, and, a Polish bike ride.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|What\'s that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|We aren\'t sure.

We can\'t ask adults for help and there\'s nobody tougher than sixth graders.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[looks down]\'\' There is... one person.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, living room. Shelly is watching TV with a bowl of soup on her lap. Stan and friends enter and approach.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Shelly?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Shut up, turd! I\'m watching television!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Shelly, you\'re my sister, right? And families... depend on each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|I said shut up, or I will destroy you, tur-r-rd!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Shelly \'\'[hesitates, begins to tear up]\'\' Somebody is going to kill me, and I can\'t go to Mom or Dad for help, so, you\'re kind of the only person I have... left. \'\'[begins to cry. Shelly notices, puts her bowl aside, hops off the sofa, and walks up to Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|\'\'[in Stan\'s face]\'\' Stop crying, turd! Now, who\'s gonna kill you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Trent Boyett. He just got released from Juvenile Hall. He was sent there for burning Ms. Claridge, but actually, it was our fault.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Oh, you are such stupid turds.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We were only four years old at the time, uh. We du-we didn\'t think about the past coming back to haunt us then. We didn\'t think and now he\'s gonna kill us!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Calm down, turd! No Juvenile Hall turd is going to kill you. That\'s my job.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|So you\'re gonna help us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Yes, but I\'m gonna want something in return.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|A picture of your mom\'s boobs?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Shut up, turd! \'\'[all four of the boys stand back in fear]\'\' You\'re going to admit to Ms. Claridge what you did!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Admit it was our fault?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|You can\'t run from your past, turds. Apologize and make amends. Then I\'ll protect you from this Trent turd. \'\'[the boys aren\'t so sure apologizing will do any good]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The intersection. Ms. Claridge is still there. No one has moved her. Cars move past her, honking at her, and two men and a woman approach the corner facing her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 5|Ms. Claridge, the people in town are really worried about you. \'\'[no reply]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman 3|Look, if you\'re having some kind of problem, you have to be able to talk to people. \'\'[no reply]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 6|Just tell us this: do you trust that we want what\'s best for you, yes or no? \'\'[no reply]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 5|All right, fine! But someday you\'re gonna have to learn to let people in! \'\'[the three walk away]\'\' Bitch. \'\'[Stan and his friends approach the corner and walk up to Ms. Claridge.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hi, Ms. Claridge. Uh, we have s-something to tell you. \'\'[no reply]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|The thing is, Ms. Claridge, we did a lot of stupid things when we were kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|A lot of stupid things that we regret.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(And it\'s time for us to come clean.) \'\'[no reply]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|See, Ms. Claridge, when we were little, we used to play with our wieners a lot, and one game we played was "Fireman."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trent|\'\'[appearing behind them]\'\' I\'ve been lookin\' for you! \'\'[the boys turn and jump upon seeing him. Kenny tightens his hood.]\'\' Five years I\'ve been waitin\' for this day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aaaaaaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Trent, look, we\'ve realized our mistake! \'\'[Trent advances, the boys back up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, our conscience got the best of us and, and we were just about to tell everyone the truth. \'\'[the boys hide behind Ms. Claridge\'s wheelchair, Trent goes around the other side and faces them behind the chair]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trent|You had five years to do that. And while I wasted away my time in prison \'\'you\'ve\'\' been enjoying nice, normal lives!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Our lives have \'\'not\'\' been enjoyable, Trent! I promise you! \'\'[the boys back up some more, away from the intersection]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trent|Don\'t tell me that! I heard about the things you\'ve done! But there were no magical Christmas adventures or talking poo for me! I DIDN\'T GET TO FIGHT A HUGE MECHANIC BARBRA STREISAND!! NO ACCIDENTAL TRIPS TO AFGANISTAN FOR TRENT BOYETT!! \'\'[advances. Cartman pulls out a taser gun as the other boys fall in behind him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Stay away from us, Trent!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What is that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s my mom\'s taser. I took it from her purse. \'\'[steps forward]\'\' Just back off, man!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trent|Look, just take your punishment! You deserve it! Let me have my retribution and it can be over with.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I am \'\'not\'\' going to have a titty twister! I hate titty twisters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trent|You don\'t even know how to use that! \'\'[advances on Cartman, who fires the taser but misses.]\'\'}} \n{{ScriptScene|The taser tips hit Ms. Claridge\'s wheelchair and begin charging her battery up. Excess power causes the wheelchair to spin twice around and go off to the corner she was facing. She hits Little Gas Shack and blows up three propane tanks just outside the store. Those tanks in turn blow up the store. Ms. Claridge catches fire and spins around a few more times. Her button blinks twice for no and she crosses back across the street, crashing into a Pets-U-Luv store. A bunch of cats attack her and she pulls back out of the store. She spins again a few more times and a policeman pulls up in his cruiser. Ms. Claridge rolls down the street and shears off a fire hydrant. She gets stuck atop the pipe and water shoots up and engulfs her. Moments later the ambulance pulls up and the paramedics prepare to put Ms. Claridge into the cargo area of the vehicle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 2|So, Trent, you just had to finish off your old preschool teacher, eh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trent|No! They did it! \'\'[silence for a few seconds]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Trent Boyett is a liar, sir.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 2|Ms. Claridge, did Trent Boyett do this to you? \'\'[two beeps, so no]\'\' Yes, yes.

He\'s hauled away and the gathered crowd disperses]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, when he gets out he\'s gonna be \'\'really\'\' mad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Whatever, that\'s like five years from now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, who cares?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The boys|Yeah, woohoo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We did it! \'\'[walks over to the side of the cruiser Trent is sitting in]\'\' So long, Trent! Have a nice time! \'\'[Trent grits his teeth in anger as Cartman dances]\'\' Nyanyanyanyanyaaanyaaa! \'\'[turns around and lowers his pants, then shakes his bare at him]\'\' Hahahahahaaahaaa! \'\'[he forgot to remove the nipple markings from it. Trent grows livid. The six-graders arrive and notice Cartman\'s buttcheeks.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sixth grader 2|Hey, hold on a second!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sixth grader 2|\'\'Bewbs\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sixth grader 1|Omigod!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sixth graders|Boobs!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sixth grader 1|\'\'[as the others argue over them and carry Cartman away]\'\' I\'m taking them to the bushes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sixth grader 2|I\'m taking them to the bushes first!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hah!
