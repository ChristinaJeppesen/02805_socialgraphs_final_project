I want you to understand a few basic rules of hunting, since this is your first time. First, don\'t \'\'ever\'\' walk with your gun unless the safety\'s on. Second, don\'t shoot anything that looks human, and third, never spill your beer in the bullet chamber.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh, Uncle Jimbo, we don\'t drink beer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|You what?!?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|mmmMoh Yeah, that\'s right, I don\'t think eight year old kids drink beer, mmm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I like chocolate milk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Well, we\'ll be doing plenty of drinking on this trip; After all, hunting sober is like ...fishing ...sober.

Now that there\'s just a technicality.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What do you mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|You see boys, the Democrats have passed a lot of laws trying to stop us from hunting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Democrats piss me off!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|They say we can\'t shoot certain animals anymore, unless they\'re posing an immediate threat.

Have you guys ever heard of \'\'[He turns his flashlight on his face for dramatic effect.]\'\' Scuzzlebutt?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whatabutt?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Scuzzlebutt is a creature that lives up on this very mountain, and kills anybody who dares climb to the top.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Because, it loves the taste of blood, and likes to add pieces to its deformed body.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Deformed how?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, on his left arm, instead of a hand, he has...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|A hook.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|A knife.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No! A piece of celery.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Celery?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, and he walks with a limp. Because one of his legs is missing.

Have you ever seen Step By Step? \'\'[Silence.]\'\' So he lives alone on this mountain, and weaves baskets, and other assorted crafts.

I\'m on TV!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Newscaster|Mayor, what are you doing to prepare for this inevitable catastrophe?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|All we know right now is that some of our children \'\'[Sob-sob.]\'\' are camping on that mountain and...

Ready, 3,2,1 \'\'[Melodramatically.]\'\' All we know right now is that some of our children are up camping on that mountain. We can\'t do anything until we get them. Okay people, let\'s go get those kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Come on everybody. You got to help the children.}}\n{{ScriptScene|On the mountain.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Uh, well, he couldn\'t have gone far, unless something drug him off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|There\'s not many animals out today, Jimbo, mmm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Yeah, it\'s almost like something funny\'s going on.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The volcano rumbles.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Christ, Ned, what\'d you have for breakfast.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Mm I don\'t know man.

Okay. Okay people, form groups and search the mountain. Report back here every hour! You got that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Mayor, I might have an uhh, idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Huh, what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well if we can dig a very large trench, we can divert the lava into a canyon, and then it would bypass South Park pretty much completely.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|And, that would be good? Right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Uh - pretty sure.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Well, what are we waiting for. Okay, people, change of plans! Half of you grab shovels!}}\n{{ScriptScene|On the mountain. Jimbo and the others have lost sight of Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|These look like its tracks. He must have gone this way.

As we near the top of the mountain, the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great. Therefore, I have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety. Mr. Garrison, if you would please.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison starts the film.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|Harbingers of sorrow, natural disasters can be the cause of troubling and undesirable stress, and the volcano is no exception. But what should you do if a volcano erupts near you or your family? Here we see the Stevens family enjoying a \'\'[Film skips]\'\' May picnic, but suddenly daughter hears a noise. It\'s a volcano. Junior seems worried. But have no fear Junior, Jane learned in school what to do when you hear a volcano erupt.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jane backs up, pulls out the blanket from under the food, and throws it over her family.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|That\'s right Jane, duck and cover.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She ducks under the blanket herself. The lava rolls over the family, causing no harm. The blanket flies off, revealing a sparkling family.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|So what will you \'\'[Film skips]\'\' -do when you hear a volcano erupting?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Two boys on bikes look alarmed. They leap off their bikes and hit the street, duck, and cover their heads with their arms.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|That\'s right, duck and cover.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The lava rolls over the two, causing no harm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|Looks like you got the idea.
