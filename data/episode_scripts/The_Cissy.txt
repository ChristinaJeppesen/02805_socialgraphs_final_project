A little surprise for them all. \'\'[Stan notices and looks. Cartman notices Stan and shoves his hand further into his pocket.

You don\'t even know what that means!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah uh-huh, it means I live a life of torture and confusion because society sees me as a boy, but I\'m really a girl.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|All right, well, if you identify yourself as a girl, you must find yourself attracted to boys. Is that right?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s actually not true. I can be transginger without it having anything to do with the ginger I\'m attracted to.

Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey sit at the table as Mr. Garrison looks outside}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Cisgender. It\'s the politically correct name for people who aren\'t transgender. If you identify with the sex you were born with, then you\'re cis.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|But then cisgender-ed is just normal}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[faces Mackey and Victoria]\'\' Saying "normal" is extremely offensive to people who aren\'t in that group. \'\'[gets emphatic]\'\' Trust me, you don\'t want this hot potato! Just let him use the girl\'s room!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|But this isn\'t a hurt and confused child we\'re talking about. This is Eric Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Nobody else is gonna know that. You better just give him what he wants.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|Sooo Eric Cartman just has us in some kind of bathroom checkmate?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Actually, \'\'[turns around and looks outside again]\'\' it\'s more like a royal flush.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Broflovski house, day.

Why a hugely popular Top-20 artist would play such a... well no offence, but such a humble venue?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|...Sorry, I don\'t think I get your-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brandon Carlile|You understand, we deal with a lot of fake stories at Spin. \'\'[glances at his pen]\'\' Was just wondering how the boys got someone like Lorde to play.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|From what I understand, she\'s the niece of someone\'s coworker here in town or something.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brandon Carlile|You wouldn\'t know who?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|No. Does it really matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brandon Carlile|\'\'[slow zoom]\'\' Lorde is an incredibly talented and down-to-earth young lady.

Have you ever been in a woman\'s bathroom, Stan? It\'s all clean and there\'s enough stalls for everyone. It was so freeing.

Kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face, and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it. Lorde represents something in all of us, the truth that wants to be heard. If I could talk to Lorde right now, you know what I\'d tell her? I\'d tell her not to let people change who she is. I\'d tell her that if people are making fun of her, it\'s probably because they lost touch with being human. I\'d tell her to keep on doing what she does, because when someone\'s not allowed to express who they are inside, then we all lose. That\'s... what I would say to Lorde. \'\'[goes back inside the house and closes the sliding door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|"Lorde"|<poem><i>[Randy\'s finished song, "Feelin\' Good On A Wednesday / Push"]\nFeelin\' good on a Wednesday\n\nThe image of me that you see\nIs distorted, twisted, broken, fractured \nIsolated, miles out to sea\nI don\'t want a separate place.\nI need to feel safe, not thrown away, away, away.\n\nAnd I will push (push)\nTo tear down the walls (push, push)\nOf this box you put me in (push, push)\nBecause you don\'t understand\n(push ow hot, push ow ow hot) You push\nTo find a label that fits me.\nI\'m feelin\' good on a Wednesday\nWith sparklin\' thoughts\nHelp me unload the car, yah yah yah\n\nAnd so I push\nTo close the door\nOf the stall you\'ve made for me,\nTo keep me away.\nAnd now we push\nPush to stand together\nBecause I am Lorde (yah yah yah)\nYah yah yah, I am Lorde\nI am Lorde, yah yah yah\nYah yah yah, I am Lorde\nYah yah yah\nYah yah yah, I am Lorde\n\nYah yah yah\n\n\'\'[While the song plays, the following montage flows: camera closes in on Randy\'s face, then on a toilet. Some of the lyrics, handwritten on yellow rule paper, scroll past. Stan looks at the restrooms again. More lyrics. The demos are playing for the record producer and Ron, and they like it. More lyrics. Two sisters listen to the song on an iPhone in the kitchen. Their mother Carol looks on from the doorway. She returns to the office the next day and stops the boss from putting up the transgender sign on a bathroom. They both listen to the song, and like it. Shelly is wearing her headphones joyfully dancing to the song. Randy looks in and smiles. Principal Victoria waves a pencil around as if she were conducting an arrangement for this song. Bebe is listening to it with Milly and Nelly in her bedroom. Butters is in his own room wearing a pink tutu and dancing away. More lyrics. Brandon Carlile is at his desk looking at his article.
