\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|A mountain pass. Ms. Crabtree is driving the kids somewhere going uphill. The kids are having a grand time running around and tossing paper airplanes.

THESE ROADS ARE SLIICK!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey, Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Are you gonna share any of that cake with the rest of us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Finishes a bite.]\'\' Hmmm, let me see. No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Come on, fatass! You shouldn\'t be eating all that cake anyway!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mmm. It\'s chocolaty and delightful.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Give us some, Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|\'\'[Turns around.]\'\' BE QUIET BACK THERRE!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Whoa, dude. The road is really snowy out there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, the road is always snowy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I know, but, it\'s really snowy today.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Now baiting.]\'\' Mmm. I can\'t possibly finish this whole cake. Oh, yes I can. \'\'[Resumes eating.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Shut up, Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ms. Crabtree slams on the brakes, opens a box, and pulls out a bunny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Okay, that does it! Y\'all be quiet or the cute little bunny dies!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She now points a gun at its head. The class gasps and look at her for a while. Sure that she has made her point, she puts the bunny back in the box and resumes driving.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, she always tries to quiet us down by threatening to kill that bunny, but I wonder if she ever would.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, she would, dude. She would.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bus comes to a halt at a road block.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|GOODD!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The sign reads: Road Closed due to Avalanche. Detour at your own risk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|OH, FOR CHRIST\'S SAKE I DON\'T BELIEVE THIS!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She starts up the bus and takes the detour.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, fat boy, give us some cake now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Exhausted.]\'\' I can not possibly eat one more bite of its chocolaty goodness. Oh, but but but, but I\'ll try.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dammit, Cartman, you are such a fat fuck!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|\'\'[Spins around.]\'\' WHAT DID YOU SAY?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She turns back around just to see the bus head for a road shoulder where the road starts to turn.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Whoa oh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She slams the brakes on, but the bus goes over the shoulder and tumbles down the side of the hill.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Hold oonn! Aaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids tumble all over the place and scream, but Cartman just munches away on the cake, quite undisturbed. The bus bounces on the bottom of the hill and lands on a river upright, floating on down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Aaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'m scared!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|BE QUIET, KID!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids look back at where they were as the bus continues down the river - and over a waterfall, straight down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|All|Aaaah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Near the river, a guide is taking a couple bird-watching.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guide|...Aand right up here you can see a red-bellied chickadee. They\'re indigenous to this area.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The guide walks forward. The husband takes a picture of the chickadee. In the background, the bus falls past them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Kids|Aaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wife|What was that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guide|\'\'[Turns.]\'\' What was what?}}\n{{ScriptScene|At the foot of the waterfall. The bus plunges into the water and bobs up facing backwards.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|All|Aaaah-}}\n{{ScriptScene|It is carried further down until the river bends. Then the bus is washed up onto the river bank, on the other side of which is a cliff. The bus teeters on the precipice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All done!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman takes his seat, but leaves the cake tin on the floor. The rest of the kids moan and groan, and they are strewn all over the bus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|I SAID \'QUIET,\' OR ELSE I KILL THE BUNNY!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bunny and gun are out again, and the kids shut up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Where are we?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|I have no idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t think we\'re in a very safe spot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, what are we supposed to do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Just keep your trap shut. I\'ll consult the manual.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She reaches for it and leafs through until she gets to it.

I HAVE TO WATCH A TRAINING VIDEO!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trainer|\'\'[The video starts.]\'\' Welcome to tape 7 of the bus driver\'s video guidebook. What to do if you become stranded. By now you\'ve calmed down the children and kept order by using the \'keep quiet or I\'ll kill the bunny\' technique. Now, it\'s time to get help. The most important thing to remember is that the children will be safe as long as they stay on the bus. So do not, under any circumstances, let any children off the bus. The best way to achieve this is to tell them something like, \'A big scary monster will eat you if you step off the bus.\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|KIIDS, DO NOT GET OFF THIS BUS. IF YOU DO A BIG SCARY MONSTER WILL EAT YOU!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trainer|That\'s right. With the children properly subdued, you can leave the bus and go out looking for assistance. And remember your bus driver\'s code: \'Sit down. And shut up!\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|I\'m goin\' for help. Ah\'ll be back as soon as I can. Remember. Don\'t get off this bus, or a big scary monster WILL EAT YOU!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She gets off the bus and walks down the river bank. The bus teeters a bit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy In The Red Shirt|Hey, why doesn\'t the scary monster eat \'\'her\'\'?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'Cause, dombass, scary monsters don\'t eat big fat smelly bitches!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|WHAT DID YOU SAY?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I said, \'Larry King won\'t grant me three wishes.\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, this is not good! She could\'ve at least kept the heat on.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A roadside. Ms. Crabtree has found a vertical path leading down to the road and climbs down some large boulders.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Had to happen to me, didn\'t it?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Reaches the curb and puts out a thumb.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Truck Driver|<poem><i>Lookin\' for love in all the wrong places\nLookin\' for love in too-</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|The truck driver sees Ms. Crabtree, then lowers the mirror and sets his hair.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Truck Driver|Whoa uhih, it\'s supper time.

What if Ms. Crabtree doesn\'t come back, and we\'re all trapped here \'\'forever\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|\'\'[Gasp, then individually.]\'\' What? Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We couldn\'t get trapped here \'\'forever\'\', Cartman.

Maybe Ms. Crabtree \'\'did\'\' make up that stuff about the big black monster.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boy turns around and smiles. The bushes behind him rustle.

Now that\'s what I-he call a sticky situation!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids laugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, but the monster outside couldn\'t be Death, because Death only touches you, it doesn\'t eat you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Oh, yeah.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, who really cares what that monster is outside? As long as we stay on the bus, it can\'t hurt us. Right?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The roof rips open and the scary monster reaches in and gropes for someone.

Can we order a pizza?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at The Tonight Show, Ms. Crabtree\'s segment has just started.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU ALL STARIN\' AT?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience laughs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|STOP LAUGHING, YOU WHORES!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|More laughs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|I SAID, SHUT UP!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience is hushed, then roars with laughter again.

That was great, ma\'am.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Was it? Does it even matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Truck Driver|Wwhat do ya mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Success is hollow, Mitch, hollow like a dead tree.

There\'s got to be a way out of this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hay, wait a minute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Remember the time when Fonzie jumped over the buses with his motorcycle?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Happy Days\' Tale: Arnold\'s at night. Every kid of driving age shows up to see Fonzie jump the buses. Two of his many admiring girls get him ready for the jump, then walk away.

He passes it and turns around, does a wheelie, and goes for the jump. He sails over the buses and lands. He gets close to the crowd and loses control. Everybody but Kenny gets out of the way.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Hey, that freakin\' bike-!)|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fonzie\'s bike smashes him into the brick wall and bounces off, and Fonzie sails over the wall. After a moment, Kenny drops, and Fonzie gets up behind the wall.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fonzie|\'\'[Triumphantly.]\'\' Eeyy!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a chocolate ice cream cone, then starts licking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my God!

That\'s not the way it happened!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, dude! Kenny just died eight hours ago from that monster! How could he have died back then, too?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Thinks.]\'\' Oh yeah, I guess that doesn\'t make sense.}}\n{{ScriptScene|As he turns around, the bus lurches again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh no!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bus teeters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Aaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What are we gonna do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|\'\'[Running around.]\'\' Aaaah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Nighttime arrives, and Kyle looks out the back window as the kids move around. Clyde and Red run to the front, and Craig runs from the front door to the seat behind the driver.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Now we need more weight in the back.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Red and Clyde run back, and the third kid runs back to the door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, that\'s too much!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Clyde and Red run to the front, but stop halfway. The front of the bus drops back to the ground.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There. \'\'[Drops into his seat.]\'\' I think we got it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t know how much longer we can keep this up, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Don\'t worry. Everything\'s gonna work out. It always does.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It does?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sure. Remember that time that that kid in the red shirt decided to go off on his own?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Ensign\'s Tale: Two nights ago. The kid in the red shirt decides not to wait for help to come, but to go and look for help himself.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy In The Red Shirt|Ehah! Well, I\'m not gonna sit here and wait to die with the rest of you! If I can make it back, ah-I\'ll send help.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Don\'t do it, kid.|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kid hops off the bus and the rest of the class goes over to the left side of the bus to see him off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hmm. Maybe Ms. Crabtree \'\'did\'\' make up that stuff about the big black monster.|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boy turns around and smiles. The bushes behind him rustle. The kids look stunned as the monster comes out of the trees and traps the boy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy In The Red Shirt|Nooooo-agh!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|The monster picks him up and swallows him whole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Holy crap, dude!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|The monster pulls out a spoon and some ice cream to enjoy with his meal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey look! He\'s got ice cream!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle and Stan smile.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Hooray! Yea!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|The roof opens up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Aaah!|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman smiles, and ice cream cones start dropping in for the kids to catch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Yea! Ha ha.|1}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids enjoy the treats.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Now, that\'s what I call a sticky situation.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids laugh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A marsh. Ms. Crabtree and the truck driver are enjoying a quiet moment.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Wow, this is gorgeous. I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen anything so beautiful.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Truck Driver|From a distance, this place looks like a cold, damp marsh. But once you get inside it...}}\n{{ScriptScene|They look at each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Truck Driver|...you realize that it has an \'\'inner\'\' beauty, far surpassing others.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He hugs her a little tighter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Truck Driver|Thank you for sharing your time with me, Ms. Crabtree.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Crabtree|Please.

Maybe we can watch TV on \'\'it\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey yeah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman hops down, goes to the driver\'s seat, and turns on the TV. After a second or two, News 4 pops up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|...And all over America, kids are turning to the streets and running away.

Aaaaaaa.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Craig tries to hang on to a seat, but loses his grip and falls through the back window screaming. With the help of Kevin, Stan pulls Kyle to safety from the back of the bus. The bus snaps in two halves, and the front end comes down along with the other half. A second later, both parts of the bus slip into the steep canyon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Aaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The scene is shown again, but this time the bus falls into a colossal tub of \'\'Super Chocolaty Chunky Funk Chip Surprise Ice Cream\'\'.

Well. Would you like some beetles for breakfast?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Beetles start crawling out of the bowl.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, please.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Liane snaps up the first beetle the leaves the bowl and eats it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Mmmm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mmmm. \'\'[Munch munch gobble.]\'\' Mmmm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Mmmm.
