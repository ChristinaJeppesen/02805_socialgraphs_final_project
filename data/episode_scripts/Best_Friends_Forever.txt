He\'s seen on the bus playing on his PSP while the other students are having fun, then in Le Bijou playing while Stan and Kyle watch a movie, then on the sidewalk passing some hot babes - he doesn\'t look up to acknowledge them, then in his bed again at night.

Inside, the city has all the appearance of a super-basilica, built with gold and marble. Angels flit around doing stuff]\'\' Things are not good in Heaven, Kenny. Satan is planning a massive attack and he knows we are too few in number to stop him! God has changed the rules here. For ages, only Mormons were allowed into Heaven. \'\'[they pass the Mormons, who greet them]\'\' But knowing that Hell was becoming much larger, God decided to let more people cross over so that he could build an army as well, an army that YOU must command.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(That I \'\'what\'\'?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Peter|The Sony PSP was built by God, to determine who on Earth had the best skills to defeat the armies of Satan.

It is from here, Kenny, that you shall command the armies of heaven.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(All right. How am I supposed to do that?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Angel 6|Simple. You will use... this. \'\'[bows towards a chair and backs off.

Your son\'s organs are all functioning again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|It\'s a miracle... Kenny, you\'re alive.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|I\'m afraid he can\'t respond to you. You see, being dead for that long, most of Kenny\'s brain cells died from lack of oxygen. Your son is alive, but, in what we call a "persistent vegetative state."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|Will he ever recover?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|I\'m afraid no. Brain cells cannot be repaired once dead. But his soul is still in here. \'\'[places his hand on Kenny\'s chest]\'\' Almost... trapped in here, if you will. Kenny is the same as he ever was. It\'s just that, now, he\'s more like ...a tomato.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|He can\'t more on his own-ah how will he eat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|A feeding tube.

I don\'t know what he would want.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, the lawyer lost that page.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, I just remembered! Kenny told me this one time, that he wouldn\'t wanna be kept alive via feeding tube.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|He did? When?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Um, it was um, this one time...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He did not say that! You just want him dead so you can have his stupid PSP!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Stupid? PSP is stupid?! \'\'[steps forth]\'\' Did you all hear that? \'\'[steps back to his little group]\'\' Uh I mean, I mean this isn\'t about PSP, Kyle! This is about my friend, and his wishes.
