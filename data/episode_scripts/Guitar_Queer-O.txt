The song playing is "Wayward Son"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Stan, you guys are good! \'\'[Stan and Kyle more their right arms around during a power chord, then quickly return to playing.

You hit the colored buttons and it makes the guitar track on the gameplay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ohhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|If they spent half the time learning a real instrument as they do playing that game, who knows what they could accomplish.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hey yeah...}}\n{{ScriptScene|The living room.

That\'s these boys playing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|\'\'[stops the tape]\'\' No, that\'s Kansas.

In the pool, two topless women splash each other with water and giggle.

We\'re super, awesome, and cool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. Life is finally going to not suck so hard for us.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, day.

Did you see that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah dude, that\'s almost impossible.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|That was real cool, kids. Hey, Kyle, there\'s a different controller in my car that might work better for you. Why don\'t you go with Jim and he\'ll help you find it. \'\'[an assistant dressed in a jogging outfit joins him behind Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, okay. Cool. \'\'[takes off his controller and follows Jim out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|\'\'[sighs]\'\' You\'ve got real potential, kid. I have no doubt you can break a million.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Really? That\'d be sweet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|\'\'[turns around and points to Stan]\'\' I think \'\'you\'\' could. But uh, as for your friend, well, to be honest, I think he\'s holding you back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What, you mean, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Look, you score a lot higher than him; there\'s no question who the better one is. I wanna put you with some other players, find a partner for you who can really help you max your score.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But, Kyle and I always play together. We both chipped in for the game system.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|\'\'[crosses his arms]\'\' Very honorable. But you know where loyalty gets you in a game like Guitar Hero? Nowhere. Just listen to that video crowd. \'\'[a shot of the video crowd cheering]\'\' I haven\'t heard a video crowd go that wild in a long time. You\'ve got a chance to score a million points, and I hate to see you throw it away because you\'re worried about your friend\'s feelings.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Café Monet, day. Mr. Kincade and Stan are outside at a table sipping coffee.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|You\'re gonna love this kid, Stan. He\'s one of the best Guitar Hero players I\'ve ever seen. Except for you, of course. \'\'[sees someone]\'\' Ah, Thad! \'\'[a boy about Stan\'s age approaches the table and takes a seat. He wears a controller on his back]\'\' Stan Marsh, this is Thad Jarvis.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thad|Sup? \'\'[an air of superiority is suggested by his tilting his head back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|That here has backed up a lot of really great Guitar Hero players. Isn\'t that right, Thad? \'\'[puffs on a cigar]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thad|Yup.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|He doesn\'t even need a game system to play on. He can play Guitar Hero acoustically.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, but can he play Buckethead on Expert Level?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Go ahead, Thad. Show him what you can do. \'\'[Thad stands on his chair, swings his controller around, and puts his right foot on the table.]\'\' Check this out. \'\'[All that is heard are the clicks of plastic on plastic]\'\' Pretty damn good, huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, that\'s pretty good. But can you play "John the Fisherman"? \'\'[Thad stops and launches into that song]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Stan, with this kid backing you, you\'re gonna make Guitar Hero history.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Male Diner|Ohoh, I love this song. \'\'[the other diners seem to understand the song the clicks are supposed to be making and begin to clap]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, later. Guitar Hero starts up and the boys are gathered near the couch watching Stan and... Thad. A song comes on and Stan and Thad begin to play. The boys cheer them on as the score nears 500,000}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wow wee, look at him go!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[enters the house]\'\' Hey dude, how\'s it-? \'\'[he has his new controller, but he\'s dismayed at what he sees. The boys look at him and the game is shut off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...Kyle. ...I, I thought you were sick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[into his hands, in a low hoarse voice.]\'\' Uh ohhh...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[walks up to Stan]\'\' Who is this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This is um, Thad Jarvis.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thad|Sup?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ahem, wha? What\'s going on, Stan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle, I was gonna tell you later. Mr. Kincade thinks I should play with Thad for a while.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But it\'s our game. We bought it together.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I know, and, and I wanna be fair about it, so, I\'ll buy you out of your part.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Buy me out?! What are you saying?! What makes you so high and mighty you can buy me out?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t put this all on me, Kyle!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my God this is so awesome.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You were the one that\'s been blowing off playing after midnight, not playing \'cause you were sick,-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I \'\'have\'\' been sick!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, the point is I\'m never gonna break a million points playing with you! You know that\'s true!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[stunned for a few seconds]\'\' I guess I didn\'t realize it was just about the points. \'\'[drops his controller next to Stan and walks out of the house, closing the door behind him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Dude, this game rules.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Let\'s just do this, all right? \'\'[a new round begins and Stan and Thad resume playing]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|EV Games. Guitar Hero advertising is plastered all over the windows. Stan enters the store. He walks over to the magazine rack and begins browsing}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brett|Hey! You\'re the kid I sold the Guitar Hero game to. How are you likin\' it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s okay, I guess. But I need some game guides for it. My manager and producer set up this live thing at the video arcade where I\'m supposed to break a million in front of everybody and I\'m I\'m stressing out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brett|Yeah, Guitar Hero can be pretty stressful. But you know, maybe instead of a game guide, you should just buy another game to kind of ...ease the stress.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[approaches the counter with a Guitar Hero game guide]\'\' Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brett|Have you ever heard of... \'\'[pulls out a different game from under the counter]\'\' Heroin Hero?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hero-Heroin Hero?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brett|It\'s a way easier game. All you do is run around a magical forest and shoot simulated heroin. You \'\'could\'\' call it the ultimate first-person shooter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|And there\'s no score? No crowds?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brett|\'\'[his voice gets soft and mellow as he speaks]\'\' No man. All you do is run through the pretty forest and chase a big dragon. But you don\'t ever catch the dragon. You just... keep chasing it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, day. He\'s playing Heroin Hero, which just consists of his character shooting heroin into his right arm. Each shot moves him forward a few steps, but he\'s no closer to the dragon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Dragon|Chase me. Come on. This way. Shoot up and then you can catch me. Come on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[playing quietly]\'\' Dude, this is awesome.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Gamecraft Arcade, day. Stan and Thad are at the arcade version of Guitar Hero; Stan is showing frustration. The song they\'re playing to is "I Wanna Be Sedated". Mr. Kincade watches them as the producer approaches}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|How are they coming?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|No worries, Mr. Hart. They\'ll be ready for the big show in a few days}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Hart|They\'d better be. I paid good money to rent this place out. \'\'[walks away. On the game screen, Stan\'s character is missing his notes and flailing about]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ugh. Damnit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thad|Dude, sup. Did you practice last night?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[frustrated]\'\' Yeah, I practiced last night! Just shut up and play! \'\'[misses some more notes]\'\' No no, you know what?! Screw this! \'\'[the music stops]\'\' I\'m not playing this song! Why did you pick this stupid song?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Stan, it\'s the song we all agreed you would play.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah? Well, I changed my mind! We\'re changing the song to Cheap Trick!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thad|No way. I hate that bubblegum crap.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah? Well you\'re not the leader, are you, Thad?! We play the music \'\'I\'\' wanna play!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Stan, why are you so grumpy-grouchy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'re playing what I want, and I\'ll select a different song!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thad|Yeah? Well, how about this one? I quit. \'\'[drops his controller]\'\' I quit, I quit, I quit. \'\'[turns around and walks away]\'\' I quit, I quit, I quit. I quit, I quit, I quit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You know what? That\'s great with me, Thad, \'cause I don\'t need you to break a million points! I never did!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Stan, what is the matter with you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I just wanna play alone, alright?! I can\'t concentrate with all these assholes riding me all the time! \'\'[Mr. Kincaid notices that Stan\'s tote bag is open and looks inside. He pulls out Heroin Hero]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|What is this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Man...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|Are you playing Heroin Hero?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Just, just a little.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|No! \'\'[stands up]\'\' Nobody plays Heroin Hero "a little"! You know, you never catch the dragon!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I know, but it mellows me out, okay?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Kincade|You\'d better pull your act together because now you\'re gonna have to break a million points and unlock superstardom solo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No problem.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A bowling alley, day. The exterior is a bit run-down, with strips of plastic pulling away from the roof. A sign by the street has "WE HAVE GUITAR HERO" on it, the R falling off. "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" plays.
