Arrest that guy! \'\'[Murphy gets right on it. Yates thinks about the hands]\'\' Whoa-whoa-wait-wait-hey-wait-wait-yo! Oh, wait a minute, no ah, I\'m wrong.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Sir?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|This isn\'t the guy. The serial killer always cuts off the victims\' left hands.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|Well those aren\'t left hands. \'\'[holds up his own left hand, palm in]\'\' See, on your left hand, the thumb faces to the left. Those are all right hands.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Ohhh. \'\'[they return to the living room]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|Nope, this isn\'t our man. \'\'[they turn to leave the house and see Michael Deets in the shadows]\'\' We\'re sorry, Mr. God. It appears we\'ve wasted your time. \'\'[they head out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[in the basement]\'\' (Hey! Help!) \'\'[upstairs, Mr. Deets closes the front door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Heh, pretty amazing coincidence that guy had a bunch of hands on his wall. Heh, no wonder that boy thought he was a killer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|\'\'[stops and thinks]\'\' Yeah... Amazing coincidence...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|\'\'[backs up]\'\' Heh- sir?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|Call it police intuition, but somethin\' in there just didn\'t feel right. \'\'[thinks for several seconds]\'\' Wait a minute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Sarge... \'\'[Lou slowly raises his hand palm in and analyzes it. Then he turns his hand over slowly until the palm is out and is jolted with recognition]\'\' What is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|I\'m not sure. I\'m gonna have to run some tests. \'\'[runs off to do just that]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Police Station, night. Montage. Yates types away at his computer, then analyzes his left hand again, then returns to the keyboard. He then goes to the lab and looks over his notes. Next to him are two hands, one right and one left. He rotates the right hand so both thumbs point to the left, from his POV, then takes more notes. He develops some pictures in the darkroom and finds matching hands. He works with a 3D model drawing with another computer, then traces his left hand on a wall and takes measurements. He returns to the lab and works with some chemicals. Next he chops some firewood into smaller chunks. Next he\'s at a gym jumping rope. Next he\'s at a beach far from South Park playing volleyball with some women. Next he\'s repairing the body of a car with a welding torch...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|\'\'[back at the station, looks in on Murphy]\'\' Murphy, do you remember what I was supposed to be doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Oh. Uhhh... Oh. Something about hands, sir? Uh, for the serial killer?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|\'\'[snaps his fingers]\'\' Oh right! The hands! Right! \'\'[the montage resumes]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Again he goes to his computer and types away then he\'s back at the lab taking pictures of the two fake hands there, then makes silhouettes of a dog, then models another hand in the computer and gets a match.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|Oh my God. Murphy! \'\'[Murphy appears quickly.]\'\' You\'re not gonna believe this.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Michael Deets house, basement. Michael Deets has resumed showing his pictures to Cartman. A picture of him at Ocean World\'s Splash Zone is shown, then a blank. He turns the projector off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Deets|That\'s it, no more pictures. \'\'[walks in front of Cartman and faces him, then pulls out a sharp knife]\'\' Time to die.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, please! I\'m sorry I gave other people credit for your killings. Ahah, it was, it was very wrong for me to lie about the other psychics and get them arrested.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Deets|Your hand will be one with the others.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Please just let me go! Ah, I\'m gonna tell everyone I\'m not really psychic! I\'ve learned my lesson! Please, I don\'t wanna- \'\'[spots the detectives descend the stairs and approach the room]\'\' I don\'t wanna have to use my psychic mind missile on you! \'\'[begins to concentrate and make noises]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|Hold it right there, killer! \'\'[Michael Deets turns and rushes at them with the knife. Yates fires three shots into him, killing him. The detectives advance, and Yates fires a forth shot into the body, looks around, and fires a fifth shot, getting blood splattered on himself]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You got here just in time. He was gonna kill me because he was insanely jealous of my incredible psychic ability.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, day. The detectives, the psychics, Mr. Johansen, Dr. Docter, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny are present.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|Well young man, you did an amazing thing. Not only did your psychic visions help us catch the killer, but a lot of innocent people are out of jail.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Johansen|Yes, thank you very much, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Female psychic|Yes, thanks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|You\'re certainly a better psychic then Eric.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, don\'t you see? Cartman never \'\'had\'\' psychic visions. And neither do these people. The plain simple truth is that nobody is psychic. There\'s a logical explanation for every psychic story you\'ve ever heard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Murphy|Do you think that\'s true?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yates|It must be true. The kid is psychic. \'\'[thinks a moment]\'\' But I don\'t suppose it really matters much. Because in the end, the way I caught the killer was with... good old-fashioned police work. Come on, Murphy. \'\'[they leave the room and then the hospital]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Female psychic|\'\'[addressing Cartman]\'\' Well young man, I guess that just leaves one score to settle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You can\'t hurt me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Male psychic|Then let this be our final battle! \'\'[the psychics face Cartman once again and battle him with their power. Nothing happens, but there\'s a lot of noise.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[irritated]\'\' Just stop it! \'\'[at the top of his lungs]\'\' Stoop iiit!! \'\'[the lights go out as the bulbs shatter, then the shelf above his bed falls and everything on it hits the floor. The psychics and Cartman stop their battle and witness all this]\'\' There\'s a logical explanation for that.}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia08|episode=13}}\n[[zh:灵能侦探卡特曼/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Eight]]'}]}}}}
