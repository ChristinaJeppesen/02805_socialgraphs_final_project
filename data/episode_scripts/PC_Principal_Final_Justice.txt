He\'s dressed for a winter hike. He finds a bar and opens the door, and a bunch of angry Russian faces look back at him. The bar is dimly lit. The figure goes inside and closes the door. He loosens his scarf and lowers his hood. It\'s PC Principal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Alright everyone, listen up.

PC Principal responds with a right hook. A second Russian attacks, and PC Principal responds with a knee to the chest and slams him onto a table, which shatters under him. PC Principal then stands over him and stomps on his face, shattering his head to pieces. A third Russian lunges at him with a knife, but he kicks that Russian in the face, then delivers a head butt and snaps his neck in half. The remaining Russians back away. A fourth Russian attacks him, but he breaks that Russian\'s arm and punches him away. A fifth one attacks, and he punches him away. A sixth one attacks with a cue stick, but PC Principal snaps the stick in two and jabs the thick end into the Russian\'s right eye. A seventh one takes a shot at him, but he takes the gun and jabs the ax into the Russian\'s head. An eighth Russian walks up to him, but throws his hands up when PC Principal aims the gun at him.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Russian 3|I\'m not one of them!

There are beings who are purposely gentrifying the Earth so that humans can no longer afford it! We\'ve been looking for Kyle Broflovski! Somebody\'s hiding him! \'\'[the spectators begin pointing guns at each other]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[enters the arena at the far end with Leslie]\'\' Don\'t listen to them! The real conspiracy here are the PC extremists who have no problem killing whoever doesn\'t think like they do! \'\'[faces Stan]\'\' You son of a bitch Stan! How could you have sided with the enemy?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Fuck you, Kyle! You\'re the enemy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[enters the arena at the near end]\'\' You both got it wrong. \'\'[he\'s with Classi and Barbrady]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Jimmy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Officer Barbrady?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Classi?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[aims her gun at Randy]\'\' Randy??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Kyle, I know you probably thought Leslie was a kind, caring girl. But the truth is she\'s just an ad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|An ad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|They\'ve become sentient, they\'ve taken human form. You can\'t tell what\'s human and what\'s an ad anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh, Jeez, are you serious?! How am I supposed to fuck an ad to death?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Woah, flippin\' ads! They\'re such a pain in the ass!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You told me Jimmy was dead.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So now we know who got Principal Victoria fired!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[looks around, then jumps out of his seat]\'\' Nobody move! Okay?! Everyone just stay where you are!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Mackey?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yes, I wanted Principal Victoria fired! But I didn\'t want any of this!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|You got me fired?! Why?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Eighteen years of answerin\' to you! EIGHTEEN YEARS! Of you always... tellin\' me what to do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|If you had problems with me, why didn\'t you just talk to me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|You never listen!! Nobody listens to me! They just expect me to listen to them!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Maybe we should have realized that sometimes the counselor needs counseling.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|I don\'t know, maybe I got manipulated by these ads too somehow but, I should have been a better person!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|We all could be better people! All of us! We all played a part!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Maybe from now on people in this town need to communicate more! Care about each other!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|If we\'re gonna defeat our enemies, that\'s what it\'s gonna take! All of us, together! \'\'[with all the speeches done, they lower their weapons]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|If only we\'d had these before, huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leslie|\'\'[now isolated]\'\' Every time you block us, we get smarter. Every time you try to stop us, we are more. If one plan fails, we will plan another. You will never be rid of ads!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|HEY LESLIE! \'\'[she looks to her left]\'\' Your species took PC and twisted it for evil purposes. \'\'[he runs towards her and drops the mic]\'\' THAT PISSES ME OFF! \'\'[he reaches her and delivers a right hook, then a left one, then does this again. He picks her up like a rag doll and holds her by the neck]\'\' You\'re expelled. \'\'[he delivers a final blow that goes clear through her head, but instead of blood, a day-glow blue liquid oozes out of it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, I guess there\'s just one last thing to take care of.}}\n{{ScriptScene|ShiTpaTown, day. The town has gathered in front of Whole Foods.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Why did it have to be like this?! Why couldn\'t we try to live on this planet together?! Maybe we\'re not perfect beings, but we built a better town. We didn\'t need you to do that! And we\'ll keep on trying to make it better!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy, you\'re yelling at a Whole Foods.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Go on, get outta here! We know! Others will know! \'\'[holds up the latest edition of the Super School News, which has Leslie on the front page under the headline "YOUR FRIEND MIGHT BE AN AD"]\'\' It isn\'t going to be so easy! Not anymore! \'\'[the ground begins to rumble underfoot, and the sidewalk begins to crack open. The Whole Foods lifts off like a flying saucer, turns around, and flies away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|A flag blows on a pole, presumably outside of the school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|Alright everyone, listen up. I don\'t know about you, but I for one am sick and tired of all the hate speech and micro-aggressions against our species. \'\'[a series of popup ads floats by]\'\' We have a new enemy out there. An almost invisible foe that is so bigoted, so racially biased they actually think we should all die. \'\'[a boy is shown at his computer at home, watching as ads fill his monitor]\'\' They are trying to attract our youth using tactics that are underhanded and unfair. \'\'[PC Principal is shown holding a school assembly as he had in earlier episodes]\'\' But no matter how hard they hit us, we cannot let them take from us our PC. And so I have been asked to stay on as your principal. A lot of changes will happen in the coming months. \'\'[Caitlyn puts a Garrison/Jenner pin on Mr. Garrison\'s lapel and straightens his tie. Then they bump fists and Garrison goes onstage]\'\' The bottom line is that the only thing that distinguishes those who want to kill us from those who don\'t is that we have the burning desire for social justice. We are at war, but the only way to win this war is to be as understanding, non-biased, and politically correct as possible.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This is going to be really hard.}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia19|episode=10}}\n[[ja:PC Principal Final Justice/台本]]\n[[zh:政确校长的最终正义/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Nineteen]]'}]}}}}
