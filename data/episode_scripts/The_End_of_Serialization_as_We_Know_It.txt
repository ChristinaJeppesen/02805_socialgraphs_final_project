The rooms continues to fall apart while Gerald and Lennart try to keep their balance as the bridegway starts to shake from the explosions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Okay, okay, look. What you\'re doing is just trying to prove that everyone is either a bad person or a snoop, right? So how is that funny?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bedrager|That\'s not what I\'m doing. I\'m showing everyone that all this stuff that they freak out over doesn\'t even matter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|No, but see, that\'s just nihilism.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bedrager|Oh, come on!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|That is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bedrager|So--so wait! If you do some big, outrageous, offensive thing with a positive attitude, you\'re a satirist, but if you\'re cynical about it, then you\'re a nihilist? That\'s fucking ridiculous!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Another explosion causes them to try and regain their balance again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|You\'re trying to get people to go to war and kill each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bedrager|So maybe this is like the new post-funny era of satire.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Another explosion causes them to move back slightly and keep their balance}}\n{{ScriptScene|SpaceX: Assembly line.

Really? Oh my God. I-I\'m sorry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Did I do something wrong?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[He grabs Heidi\'s hands.]\'\' No. No, Heidi. Why would you think that? \'\'[He then turns her away, so she doesn\'t see what\'s going on with the chamber.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|You don\'t really talk to me the same way you used to. Oh, God, I\'m sounding needy, huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah, go on.}}\n{{ScriptScene|As Heidi starts talking, Cartman focuses on Butters and the male #OccupyMars SpaceX employee who has attached the hose to one of the chamber\'s valve and making adjustments. }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|Eric, I just--I hope that you\'re always honest with me, even if you think it might hurt my feelings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh-huh. Yeah, cool.

Gerald has his back turned to Lennart Bedrager}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I can\'t argue with you anymore. I want to stand here and tell you that you and I are different, but its not true. \'\'[He turns around.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|All we\'ve been doing is making excuses for being horrible people. \'\'[Bedrager looks down, agreeing with Gerald.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I don\'t know if you tried to teach me a lesson, but you have. \'\'[He slowly shuffles forward towards Bedrager.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I have to stand here and look at you, and all I see is a big fat reflection of myself. \'\'[He stops a few inches from Bedrager.]\'\' With only one minor difference.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Gerald hops forward and kicks Lennart Bedrager between his legs, causing him to drop down in pain. Gerald then grabs him by his jacket and tosses him off the bridgeway.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bedrager|Noooooo!!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Ha! Fuck you!
