Shelly bad, you good.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Clone Stan proceeds to destroy the house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s tearing up the house, stop him!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Clone Stan is hitting a chair against the ground.

Nooooo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|All I ever wanted was to genetically engineer something useful, but I failed. Perhaps we shouldn\'t be toying with God\'s creations.
