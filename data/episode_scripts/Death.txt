In fact, I think that\'s illegal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|See, I told you dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, yeah, but what if the grandpa wants to die, cause he\'s really old, and he\'s just asking for help?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, like assisted suicide. What about that?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stops himself twice before responding}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I don\'t want to touch that with a forty foot pole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What\'s the big deal? Why won\'t anybody talk about this???}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park PTA Meeting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|And I myself was not aware of this horrible show until recently.
