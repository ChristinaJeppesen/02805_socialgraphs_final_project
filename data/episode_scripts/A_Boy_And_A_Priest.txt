Maxi points to a bird. Maxi and Butters row in a canoe. Butters and Maxi sit on a bench at Stark\'s pond watching the sunset. They watch a family of ducks floats by. Maxi puts his right arm around Butters, Butters puts his left hand on Maxi\'s lap. They go to the movies and enjoy some snacks. A couple to their left just stares at them. They\'re in the park on some swings when the four boys stop by and look at them, then continue walking. They\'re at the organ in church. Maxi plays some tunes for Butters. Maxi shows Butters some Bible verses on the computer. At the public library, Maxi holds Butters a little closer, Butters puts his left hand over his right shoulder and cups it over Maxi\'s right hand. A man picks out from his computer nearby and looks at them. In his bedroom, Butters shows Maxi the fun he has in playing Professor Chaos. Back in the woods, at night, Maxi shows Butters a shooting star. Still in the woods, during the day, Butters points out a cloud formation that sort of resembles a dove.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The cathedral in Denver, day.
