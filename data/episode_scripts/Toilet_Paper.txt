\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. A new classroom. As the camera follows a new teacher around, the following kids are seen working with clay. Clyde presses the pottery wheel pedal as Bebe molds a vase on the wheel. Wendy watches. Tweek, Red, and Pip work on clay on the table near the wall. In the foreground, Tolkien presses the pottery wheel pedal as Annie molds a vase. Butters, Kevin, and Francis work on their own projects. Kenny, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman are laughing at their project, which didn\'t require the use of the pottery wheel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teacher|\'\'[walks through the class]\'\' Okay. Good, children, good. Remember to \'\'feel\'\' the clay. Be one with the clay. Nice.

The boys hold their laughter, knowing how she looks with their creation like that, but soon they burst out laughing. The teacher now cradles the project]\'\' Well, you four can just spend your afternoon after school here making \'\'new\'\' pottery! \'\'[the laughter stops and the boys\' jaws drop.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You can\'t do that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teacher|I certainly can!

This isn\'t playtime, you\'re being punished!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[glares back at her, then softly]\'\' Fine! But we\'ll have the last laugh tonight, art-whore!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[in pain]\'\' Yeah! Payback time, you ugly skank!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Henry\'s Supermarket, day. A woman watches her son ride in a coin-operated ride outside the store. Inside, the four boys approach checkout line 3 with two carts stacked high with packages of Kush Tush toilet paper.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|D\'you think that\'s enough?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Should be fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Don\'t you guys think this is a little suspicious? We should buy something else so it doesn\'t look obvious.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay. \'\'[reaches behind the other boys and grabs something]\'\' Here we go, pack of chewing gum. \'\'[tosses it into the first cart. They approach the cash register]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cashier|Hello boys. Find everything you need?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yep.

Look there! \'\'[the teacher prepares the dining-room table]\'\' There\'s Mrs. Streibel! This is the place. \'\'[loosens the drawstring on his back and lets the sides fall away. In the dining room, a boy and girl arrive and sit at table]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh wait, wait, there\'s kids inside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|So we\'re not TP\'ing a house with kids inside it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle, we all agreed to do this!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We didn\'t say nothin\' about no kids, man!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kyle, you\'re being an asshole! Now let\'s do this thing and get out of m\'yeah. \'\'[takes out a roll and advances a bit]\'\' Here\'s what I think of your art class, you God-damned bitch! \'\'[unleashes the first roll]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah! Fuck you!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Majestic music plays as Kenny unleashes his roll. Stan unleashes a roll. Cartman tosses off another one and grins. More rolls of paper fly onto the roof. Kyle tosses up a roll, unsure of doing so. Stan unleashes another one, and his glee is unabashed. Kenny tosses off another one. More and more rolls fly over the roof. Kyle freezes in awe of their vandalism. Toilet paper covers the house, the garage, and the trees around the house. The boys head for the sidewalk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Come on, let\'s go! \'\'[he and Kenny cross the road and drop down to a ditch on the other side. Stan follows]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What have we done? \'\'[Stan looks back and gets Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Let\'s go, Kyle! \'\'[drags him off.

We\'re in sooo much trouble.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aw man, that was sooo awesome! \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|How can you say that? Did you see what we did to their house?!

We\'re all in this together.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle\'s house, after bedtime. Kyle\'s room. He is asleep, but begins to have nightmares.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Noo! No. \'\'[visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.]\'\' Noo! \'\'[an image of Mrs. Streibel\'s house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Streibel|AAAAAAAAA!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|Honey, what is it??

Whyyy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[wakes up, startled]\'\' Ah! Oh God! Oh God!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, next day. The kids are in their regular classroom chatting, waiting for class to begin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey, uh, you guys here what happened last night? Mrs. Streibel\'s house got covered with toilet paper.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Yeah. They say it\'s gonna take three weeks to get it all down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah? Well, Ol\' Mrs. Streibel probably had it comin\' to her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I don\'t know. I don\'t think anybody deserves \'\'that\'\' kind of brutality.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, I understand the people who did it weren\'t caught, so-o... Looks like nobody will ever know the geniuses who masterminded that perfect crime. \'\'[the bell rings and Mr. Garrison enters with some books.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay children, let\'s take our seats. Oh, uh, Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny, the counselor wants to see you in his office, now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[snaps his fingers]\'\' Damn!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh God!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside the counselor\'s office. The boys sit on chairs next to the door - the bench is gone. Kyle looks around nervously.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|How the hell did they find out it was us that TP\'ed that house?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Will you relax, Kyle?! They have nothing on us! As long as we all stick to our story, we\'ll be fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'d better go over our story again so we don\'t screw it up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay. Last night, all four of us were at the bowling alley until about 7:30, at which time we noticed Ally Sheedy, the Goth chick from the Breakfast Club, was bowling in the lane next to us, and we asked her for her autograph, but she didn\'t have a pen, so we followed her out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'m confused. Did Ally Sheedy take that personality}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yes, dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kyle, it\'s very simple: we followed Ally Sheedy out to her car, but on the way we were accosted by five Scientologists who wanted to give us all personality tests, which were administered at the Scientology Center in Denver until 10:45, at which time we accidentally boarded the wrong bus home and ended up in Rancho de Burritos Rojos, south of Castle Rock, and finally got a ride home with a man who was missing his left index finger, named Gary Bushwell, arriving home at 11:46, you got it??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ah, Ah I, ah I thought...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[exasperated]\'\' Oh, for Christ\'s sake!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, Kyle, just let Cartman do all the talking, okay? He\'s better at being in trouble than anybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Thank you, Stan. \'\'[the doorknow begins to turn]\'\' Sh sh, here they come, here they come. \'\'[the door opens and Mr. Mackey appears]\'\' "And so I said, \'That\'s a terrific joke, Wendy. Tell us another one.\'" Oh, hello, Mr. Mackey. Are you ready to see us now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|We\'re gonna talk to you one at a time, boys, m\'kay? Kenny, will you step into my office, please?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Me??)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Come on, Kenny, let\'s go, \'k? \'\'[Kenny hops off and enters the office, and Mr. Mackey closes the door. The other boys\' jaws drop a bit.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Touchй, Mr. Mackey, touchй.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Why are they doing us one at a time?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|They want to see if we mix the story up, and see if someone will rat out the other three for a better deal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[brightens up]\'\' I can get a better deal?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kyle, so help me God, if you Jew us out on this one, I will fucking kill you!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Streibel house. Mr. Streibel is removing the toilet paper from the trees and house with a broom. He\'s already filled two trash bags of toilet paper and is filling a third.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|There we go. That should be about the last of it. \'\'[Officer Barbrady passes by with police tape, stretching it out from tree to tree. The camera pulls back to show the house is also covered in police tape]\'\' Ex- excuse me, uh, wha-what are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Crime scene investigation! \'\'[pulls out a small tape recorder and starts speaking into it]\'\' There are several footprints in the snow. Perhaps more than one perpetrator? \'\'[turns it off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|Ah... look, we really don\'t wanna make a big deal out of this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|\'\'[noticing the trash bags]\'\' Is that the toilet paper there? I\'ll need to take those bags as evidence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|Look it\'s just not that big a deal, I mean, I toilet-papered houses myself when I was a kid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|You?! So where were you last night at around 9?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|I was here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Aha!! Got you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|Officer, why would I TP my own house?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Insurance?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|It wasn\'t me, okay? Now, if you don\'t mind, I just wanna get my yard back to normal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|\'\'[grabs him by the collar]\'\' Now you listen to me! Whoever TP\'ed your house is still out there roaming the streets. It\'s only a matter of time before another house and another family is victimized! I have to stop that from happening.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|You really have nothing better to do, do you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|No I do not.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle\'s house, after bedtime. Kyle\'s room. He is asleep, but the nightmares return.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Noo! No. \'\'[visions of flying toilet paper fill his head.]\'\' Noo! \'\'[an image of Mrs. Streibel\'s house being vandalized further, then of Mrs. Streibel running in horror.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Streibel|AAAAAAAAA!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Streibel|Oh, Jesus no!

Whyyy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[wakes up, startled]\'\' Oh God! Oh God!

Thanks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Is there anything else I can get for you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Noo, I\'ll just... be... going back to bed now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You do that. Goodnight, Kyle. \'\'[closes the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Juvenile Hall, day. Inside, the warden leads Officer Barbrady to Cell Block 4.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Warden|Josh Meyers TP\'ed over six hundred houses in less than a year. \'\'[fumbles for his keys.]\'\' He\'s a real monster.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|I just need to talk to someone who knows how toilet paperers think.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Warden|Just remember: he\'d toilet-paper you in a second if he had the chance. \'\'[finally opens the door]\'\' He\'s the last cell on your left. \'\'[Barbrady enters and finds himself in an old part of the Hall. He walks past the prisoners and arrives at Josh\'s cell. It is a brick cell with a thick glass wall where prison bars would normally be. Holes in the glass allow for conversation.

I\'m with the South Park police.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|\'\'[affecting a Hopkins accent]\'\' That\'s a terrible cologne you\'re wearing, officer.

Because I\'m such a charming fella?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Uh please, I need your help. What would you want in return?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|\'\'[turns away]\'\' Due to the harsh nature of my crimes they don\'t allow me to have toilet paper in my cell. You can imagine how bothersome that becomes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|You... know I can\'t give you toilet paper, Josh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|\'\'[turns back]\'\' No, but it was worth a try, wasn\'t it? \'\'[a closeup of Josh\'s face]\'\' Tell me something, officer: why is it that you police such a small town.

Tell me what you know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|Are those the crime scene photos? Let me see them. \'\'[approaches the drop slot as Barbrady slides the packet of photos in, then walks back and takes them out for review.]\'\' Yes. Yes. Not bad work, not bad at all. These toilet-paperers are professionals...at least one of them is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|So you think there was more than one. Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|\'\'[puts the photos behind his back]\'\' Tell me something first. When you went to the academy you had something to prove. You wanted to protect and serve, but mostly you wanted to protect yourself. Who were you protecting yourself from, Officer Barbrady?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Oh all right, all right, my uncle Charles used to hit me with a belt! \'\'[cries uncontrollably]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|\'\'[closes his eyes, satisfied.]\'\' Thank you. Your toilet-paperers are most like males between the ages of 8 and 10 and probably virgins. Parents notice that much toilet paper missing, so they would have to have bought it themselves.

He\'s losing it. He\'s gonna crack.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(I think so too.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kyle can\'t take the heat; he\'s gonna sing like a canary.

The boys head for the station and enter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Hello boys. How are you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We heard that you have the person who TP\'ed the art teacher\'s house? Is that true?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|It sure is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh, can we see them-him-her?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Right over here. \'\'[takes the boys over to the one jail cell]\'\' Yeah, we interrogated the suspect for over forty hours, and he finally cracked. \'\'[the boys turn right to see the suspect]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey fellas!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Butters?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yep. I\'m in jail.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You con-fessed?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh huh. Unh, they said I TP\'ed the art teacher\'s house. \'\'[thoughtful]\'\' I don\'t seem to remember it, \'\'[normal]\'\' but they\'re pretty sure it was me. \'\'[approaches the bars and grabs them]\'\' I just can\'t get my behavior under control!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|!Officer Barbrady|His parents are on their way down now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah.

This is a gift from God. An early Easter present all wrapped up in a pretty ribbon from Jesus Christ himself!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well I\'m just a little asshole, is what \'\'I\'\' am. When God made me, he must have not been payin\' very close attention, \'cause I turned out wrong! Just plain wrong!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Officer Barbrady, Butters didn\'t TP that house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Why do you say that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Because it was-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[rushes up and intervenes]\'\' Wiffle ball, anyone? \'\'[glares at Kyle]\'\' Anyone care for a nice game of Wiffle ball?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|You know, it\'s not my parents I\'m worried about. It\'s my girlfriend, Carrie. Why, she lives in Michigan. But when she finds out about this, woooo smokey, is she gonna be sore! She might even break up with me. And it would serve me right, too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|All right, boys, visiting time is over. Thanks for stopping by.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Police Department, outside. The boys leave the station.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You see guys, it all worked itself out. Tadow, tadow, how you like me now? Feel a little silly now, Kyle? Tadow, how you like me now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I still feel bad, Cartman}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What? Hu- How can you feel bad? Somebody else is gonna pay for our crime.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. That makes it even worse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Bu... ...eh... Kyle, you don\'t seem to understand. We\'re we\'re not gonna get punished for this. Ever.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So... so then, how can you feel bad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He feels guilty for doing it and for letting someone else pay for it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...But he\'s not gonna get in trouble.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It doesn\'t matter if you get in trouble of not, you can still feel bad. \'\'[to Kyle]\'\' I think you\'re right, Kyle. Maybe we should confess.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah, maybe we should.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?? Eh... \'\'[tries to be upbeat]\'\' hey you guys! There\'s nothing to feel bad about! We\'re, we\'re off scot-free!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We feel bad for other people.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[looks at the other boys in disbelief]\'\' For oth-er... \'\'[winces]\'\' Uh. Oww. ...Ih ...Ih, ih, is it that ...you think you might get in trouble later?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Tomorrow in school we\'ll all tell the teacher it was us, and let her decide what to do. \'\'[points an accusing finger at Cartman]\'\' And Cartman, if you had any thread of a conscience at all, you\'ll do the same! \'\'[He, Kyle, and Kenny leave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Eh buh... eh... eh... Freakin\' weirdos, man!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Police Department. The Stotches arrive at the police station and charge in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Well well well!

Again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|What fibs have you been telling this policeman, Butters?! You know damn well you didn\'t toilet-paper that house!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Huh??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Butters was with us all night, Officer Barbrady.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|Butters, what have we told you about confessing to crimes you didn\'t commit?! We have had it, mister!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, he kept accusin\' me for hours, and then he shot me up with sodium pentathol.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|And that\'s your excuse?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Well, looks like I made a mistake. I... guess I\'d better let you out now. \'\'[goes to the cell door and opens it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Just wait till we get you home, you little fibber!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[steps back from the door]\'\' Officer, can I stay in jail, please?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The woods near Stark\'s Pond, evening.

Come on!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stark\'s Pond, later. Cartman rows the small boat to the middle of the lake, as he did before with Kyle.

We have something we need to tell you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|All right. Will you people stop barging into my office, please?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|What\'s the matter, Principal Victoria? Was your mother abusive?

It\'s over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|Luckily for us, one of you had enough of a conscience to come forward.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|My consciences just caught up with me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s not fair!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|You all get two weeks of detention, except Eric, who gets one week for being brave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But, but he\'s lying!
