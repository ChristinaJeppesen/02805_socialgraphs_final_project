I know a lot of you want a chance to speak, but we have to talk one at a time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[stands]\'\' Look, our kids are learning sexual things on the street and on television. There\'s no way we can stop it. The schools have to teach them sexual education at a younger age.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|School policy has been to teach sexual education later. In the fifth grade.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Tweek|It isn\'t soon enough.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Yeah. Why, just this afternoon our son was caught beatin\' off our dog. \'\'[Randy and Sharon look at each other in recognition of the act]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Look, parents. Do you really want your children learning about sex? Part of the fun of being a kid is being naive! Let them be kids for a while.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Naive at what cost, Chef? Parents, we have to face facts: Children in America are having sex at younger and younger ages. STDs are affecting younger and younger kids all the time. The only way we can combat that is by educating children before they have sex.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|The first thing that kids learn about sex shouldn\'t be some bitch-scare tactic about STDs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|\'\'[rising]\'\' No, she\'s right! With all the teen pregnancies that are out today, I think my boy \'\'does\'\' need to know about sexual education. \'\'[sits, then rises again]\'\' From the school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Adults|Yeah. Uh huh. Yeah, we have to.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. "Fourth Grade B" is shown on a classroom door. Sixteen boys are present.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Okay, boys, this is the first day of sexual education, m\'kay? Now, I know that some of you think this is very funny.

We\'re goin\' tuh get through this by being mature and grown up, m\'kay. \'\'[turns and goes over to turn off the light, and turn on the projector with a remote control.

Here we see the testes and the scrotum. \'\'[Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman stifle some more giggles]\'\' STOP that, m\'kay! The next person that laughs is gonna get a referral! \'\'[the boys stop quick]\'\' M\'kay. Now, in order to have intercourse, the man takes his penis, and he... hmmm... uhh... \'\'[slows his speech a bit]\'\' let\'s see, the man takes his penis, and he... hm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, haven\'t you ever had intercourse, Mr. Mackey?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well, sure I have!

Well let\'s start with our first lesson, then, shall we? \'\'[writes on the board]\'\' SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES!! \'\'[the girls sit quietly]\'\' That\'s right, because unless you get boys to wear condoms you can and will get a sexually transmitted disease from them! How fun is that, hmmm?! Is that fun?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|I didn\'t mean that-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Today over 20,000 Americans will contract a sexual disease! TODAY! Twelve thousand more tomorrow! And the reason is that you girls wake up in the morning and say, "It\'s not going to happen to me." You say, "Oh, Ms. Choksondik, that happens to girls in Detroit, in Brooklyn, but not here in Colorado." WRONG! \'\'[the girls look chastened]\'\' Gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, HPV, HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, the list goes on and on! These are serious diseases! They have serious consequences! \'\'[the girls are definitely afraid]\'\' You think that sex is about fun and games and love? \'\'[now with a folder in her left hand]\'\' Wrong! Sex is about disease!

Mr. Mackey doesn\'t teach us nothin\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Yeah, I don\'t think Ol\' Mackey knows a hymen from a hysterectomy. And Choksondik?

Now, move along, children, you\'re holdin\' up the line.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school cafeteria, moments later. The boys exit the kitchen.

It\'s probably best we come up with a lesson plan together anyway.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yeah I\'ve already gone over most of the basics, you know, uh with the boys, but I uh... eh just wanted to see what else you were teaching the girls, in case I... "missed" anything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|\'\'[reaches for a book and opens it]\'\' Well we should make sure our students are good and scared of the consequences.

I wasn\'t sought after much in high school or college. \'\'[rises and moves off some distance]\'\' I was made fun of most of my life for having such large glasses. \'\'[looks down at her rims]\'\' The only boyfriend I ever had was this attractive popular boy named Steven Garrett.

I\'m sorry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|People can be very cruel. Anyway, I know it\'s hard to understand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Ah actually I understand perfectly. I... I wasn\'t exactly the captain of the football team, either, huh huh, hehehuh, \'\'[softly]\'\' anyhow \'\'[normal]\'\' And then as I got older my... my head just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of my body stayed the same.

I filled the other one up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Why are you wearing a condom?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So I don\'t get AIDS.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Eric, you can\'t get AIDS from just sitting around, you have to get it from sex.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|From sex??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You mean, intercourse with a girl?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yes! Now will you all pay attention, please?! The vagina and the clitoris are on the outside, and they are in fact very easily visible to the naked eye.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|All this time... It\'s the \'\'girls\'\' that give \'\'us\'\' diseases! }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I knew it! Girls lie! They lie right to your face!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Now here we can see the interior female anatomy.

If us boys are going to live, we have to get rid of the girls!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, come on guys, this is war! \'\'[leaves his seat and heads for the door. The other boys follow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|\'\'[among their statements]\'\' Yeah! That\'s right! Come on!  \'\'[The last of the boys leaves, and Mr. Mackey doesn\'t notice. He begins to daydream. The generic female drawing turns into one of Ms. Choksondik, and he grins. He goes to the screen again, and moves his hand over the image]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|And here we see the tender, magical uterus. Here we see the enticing, voluptuous Fallopian tubes, m\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison\'s room, later}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay, children, now I wanna review the different sexual positions. Who can tell me which sexual positions we talked about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Filmore|\'\'[raises his hand]\'\' Miss\'nary position?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[turns around and writes the position]\'\' Missionary position, good. A little boring, but tried and true. What else?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girl|Doggie?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[turns around and writes the position]\'\' That\'s right. Doggie style we went over, mhm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy|Pile driver?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[turns around and writes the position]\'\' Uh huh, pile driver position. Good, Quaid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Flora|The Filthy Sanchez?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[turns around and writes the position]\'\' Yes, good Flora, you remembered the Filthy Sanchez.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 2|Hot Karl?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[turns around and writes the position]\'\' Yes,you can give your partner the ol\' Hot Karl, sure.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A barren field near the school, day. An army of boys comes in from a distance in makeshift military vehicles. Butters is wearing a hockey mask. Clyde comes up and stops them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|There, you see? The girls have built some kind of stronghold to keep us out. \'\'[the stronghold has a moat and reads: "Boys Keep Out"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[at the helm of a gun turret]\'\' Stay away from us, bastards! We don\'t wanna get pregnant!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Yeah! Just take your diseases and go away forever!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ha!

Huh, what the heck am \'\'I\'\' supposed to say?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Just tell them that if they leave town peacefully, we won\'t have to resort to violence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[lowers his mask and speaks into the mike. A deep raspy voice comes out]\'\' Just walk away. You can put a stop to all this. Just walk away and we will spare your lives. Just walk away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[to Stan]\'\' Man, he\'s pretty good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|We\'ll never walk away. Never! \'\'[tosses a boomerang towards the boys.

Attack! \'\'[the boys rush the stronghold]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ms. Choksondik\'s house, at that moment.

Do you wanna drink?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Why, sure. \'\'[she goes to get drinks]\'\' Hey uh I think I can... get through that stuff pretty quick, mm... \'\'[he gets a good look at her derriere]\'\' Uh, maybe we should come up with another lesson plan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|\'\'[hands Mr. Mackey his drink]\'\' Something about how nerve endings play an important part in intercourse. \'\'[sits down]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Uh, right, right, uh, like in the ...nipples.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Or the... shaft... of the penis? \'\'[they look away from each other]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|It... says here that the uh, head of the penis is actually the... most sensitive... part, m\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Why, yes. The nerve endings are the most concentrated at- the- tip of the penis. Like they are in the... \'\'[looks at him. They draw close to each other]\'\' clitoris of the woman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|And these... are the two areas most important to-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Sexual stimulation. \'\'[they kiss quick, then kiss full and long.

What do you do when you think about me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|I go crazy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Do you touch yourself?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yeah. Hmm. \'\'[they embrace. She takes off his tie. He stands, walks some distance, and takes off his shirt. She stands, takes off her top, and tosses it away. She approaches him and removes his belt. He takes off his pants. She looks at him again and goes down to remove his briefs. She tosses them aside. He bends down to remove her underwear and tosses them aside. She coaxes him down, and he follows]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|\'\'[writhing]\'\' Haawww. Haawww.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|G\'oh, m\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Oh my God.

No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|\'\'[looks into his eyes and then]\'\' Oh well, fuck it \'\'[they go down, and the consummation begins]\'\' Oh God, give it to me! \'\'[his ass rises for the first time]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Oh yeah. Woh. \'\'[his ass appears again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Woh. \'\'[his ass appears again]\'\' Ooh, that\'s it baby! That\'s it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[his ass appears again]\'\' Aw, this feels so good, m\'kay. \'\'[his ass appears again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The empty field. later. The battle is joined. Kids run around seeking positions from which to shoot. Seven boys come up to the stronghold gate. Millie fires a Gatling gun at them from the left side, and they scatter, dropping their weapons}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|WAAAAHHH!! \'\'[two boys prepare a Molotov cocktail, and one of them tosses it at the tires on the right side of the gate entrance. The tires go up in flames. The boys run away, and a huge flash explosion rises inside the stronghold]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girls|Waaaahh!! \'\'[they bail out immediately, and a much larger explosion rises, tossing kids away left and right]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house. Randy and Sharon are reading papers when the house moves about as if an earthquake had just rolled by. Sharon drops her paper}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|What the hell was that?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ms. Choksondik\'s house. Mr. Mackey and Ms. Choksondik rise from their activity and look out the window}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Did you feel something?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Chef\'s house.

The four remaining staff members, Principal Victoria, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Adler, and Ms. Chosie, walk out and see the wreckage.

You\'re in big trouble now.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The empty field. later. All the parents have come by to make sure their kids are okay.

You should be ashamed of yourselves. \'\'[in the background paramedics pick up injured kids and put them in ambulances]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We just didn\'t want the girls giving us diseases.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|I\'m afraid this is all my fault.

But sex isn\'t something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams. Sex is emotional and spiritual. It needs to be taught by family. I know it can be hard, parents, but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids, you don\'t know \'\'who\'\' they\'re learning it from. It could be from someone who doesn\'t know, \'\'[a shot of Mr. Mackey]\'\' someone who has a bad opinion of it, \'\'[a shot of Ms. Choksondik looking around]\'\' or even a complete pervert. \'\'[a shot of Mr. Garrison]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Wha? Why did you pan to me just now? What the hell is \'\'that\'\' s\'posed to mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|He\'s right.

The right time to start having sex is... 17.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Seventeen? \'\'[Sheila and Gerald approach]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Seventeen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|So you mean 17 as long as you\'re in love?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Nope, just 17.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|But, what if you\'re not ready at 17?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Seventeen! You\'re ready. \'\'[Stan walks up to Wendy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I guess we got a while to wait before we have to worry about sex and diseases, huh, Wendy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Yeah. Thank God.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, I guess now that that\'s out of the way, we can get on with our lives. Come here, boy! \'\'[a dog enters the scene, and the camera begins to zoom out.
