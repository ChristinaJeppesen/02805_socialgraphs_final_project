\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny provides a recap of what happened last week on the show, with clips from that episode.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|Previously, on South Park.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The intro follows with the boys dresses as fantasy figures, and dramatic music matches them.

As the rest of the army watches, Butters and Scott do some swordplay. Scott\'s tongue is hanging out of his mouth}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|En garde! \'\'[Butters takes up his sword and swordplay resumes. While the crowd cheers the swords-boys on, Cartman is not impressed, and he buries his nose in his hand while squeezing his eyes shut]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright, stop, stop, stop! \'\'[leaves his chair and walks up to Scott and Butters]\'\' This is NOT how you fight! You think this is a joke?! On Black Friday, there\'s gonna be thousands of shoppers trying to get inside that mall keeping you from getting Xbox Ones! So what do we do?! We survey each enemy, and we attack their weak spots!

They need more training.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s not enough! Ever since Kenny switched sides, there are more kids that wanna go with PS4 on Black Friday.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That Goddamn traitor! You know why Kenny\'s doing this, right? Because he wanted to be a princess, and I wouldn\'t let him! \'\'[they go through the sliding door]\'\' I said, "You can be a chick, Kenny, but there\'s only one ruler, and that\'s me!" \'\'[reaches his refrigerator and opens it, looking for something to consume]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sony released the PS4s, Cartman. They\'re being reviewed.

Two can play at Kenny\'s backstabbing game. \'\'[leaves, forgetting to close the refrigerator door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s room, moments later. Cartman is at his desk placing a call, still grousing about Kenny}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Stupid asshole! \'\'[looks at a picture of himself and Kenny at Casa Bonita putting their arms around each other, with dreamy expressions, as they used to be best buds.

You sound ridiculous.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dave|\'\'[looks at John, then]\'\' There\'s... going to be a war in this small town on Black Friday, and it\'s all over the news!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ballmer|Guys, these are console wars, not some epic battle for a kingdom. I mean, come on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dave|...but, this one kid said that he\'s a wizard, and that Sony is helping-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ballmer|Guys, guys guys! It\'s just a video game machine, alright?

That\'s 90% off!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard 8|Oh God! They\'re back! The shoppers are back! \'\'[the camera pulls back to reveal a large crowd of shoppers slowly moving towards the mall.

I\'ll handle this. \'\'[exits the mall]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside the mall, night.

The little prick thinks he\'s Daenerys Targaryen. I need to know how to deal with him. \'\'[picks a rose out for Butters, just as he did for Kenny before.]\'\' How do they deal with the Queen of Dragons in \'\'Game of Thrones\'\'?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|They don\'t!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well did you finish watching Season 3 like I asked you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, I finished it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So what happens when the dragons show up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Nothing! The dragons are just still on their way! They keep promising dragons, but all I get are more floppy wieners in my face!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butter-Butters! The key to our victory is following the \'\'Game of Thrones\'\' model exactly. I have to know what happens when the dragons show up so I know how to deal with Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wha-what do you want \'\'me\'\' to do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Here\'s two bus tickets to New Mexico. I want you to take Sir Scott Malkinson and go seek out George R. R. Martin for answers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Who\'s George R. R. Martin?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|He\'s the guy who writes \'\'Game of Thrones\'\', Butters! He can let us both know how to handle Kenny, and if we should betray Clyde or not. Let\'s face it, Butters, this is really about you and me getting XBoxes. The rest are simply there to help us get through those doors.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thompson|Hey! I told you kids to stay out of my damn yard!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[shoots back]\'\' Do you mind?! We\'re trying to talk here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thompson|Yeah?! Well how come every time you talk to somebody, it\'s about betraying somebody else?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Why don\'t you mind your own business?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Microsoft headquarters, night. Steve Ballmer is on the phone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ballmer|No. Listen, for the last time, we don\'t have any dragons to send them. If some people wanna choose PlayStations, it\'s their choice. \'\'[a knock is heard]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Secretary|Sir, Mr. Gates is here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ballmer|Bill Gates? \'\'[to the caller]\'\' Uh, I gotta go. \'\'[hangs up, rises from his seat, goes around the desk, and greets Bill Gates]\'\' Hey heeey!

Just tryin\' to get this next gen press stuff handled.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gates|I heard there\'s a little trouble in uh, Colorado somewhere?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ballmer|Oh it\'s- no, it turns out it was nothing, just some kids tryin\' to turn the console wars into somethin\' bigger.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gates|Oh my gosh.

Some changes \'\'do\'\' need to be made. \'\'[the hitman reaches around and stabs Ballmer through the chest and drags the dagger to the right, cutting open Ballmer\'s chest even more. Ballmer cries out, but is choking in his blood. Ballmer steps backwards and falls on his back gasping for air. Gates takes a glass of wine to a sofa and sits down to look at Ballmer]\'\' Do you know what weakness is, Steve? Weakness is believing that competition is healthy. See, there was a time when XBoxes and PlayStations could both survive in this world, but that time\'s done. It\'s all headed to one device that people game on, watch TV on, socialize on. There\'s only going to be one winner. I can\'t have you idiots throwing away everything I worked so hard to achieve. \'\'[Ballmer takes his last gasps as Gates walks out of the CEO\'s office.

For what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That could be up to you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, Cartman. You said nobody will have to be grounded.
