Another man takes the 4.}}\n{{ScriptScene|On the street, two men use a third as a battering ram and throw him into the electronics store through the big display window.

Well, anyway, I\'m not one to give away the ending, but I will say that it spirals toward an incredible twist-turn that parallels my own life. }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Thank you, Officer Barbrady.

Five-twelve at 635 Avenue de los Mexicanos; request assistance.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The siren goes on. Cut to Kenny\'s house. Cartman arrives and jumps off the bike, makes his way to the front door, and knocks. Stuart opens the door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sir, could you step out of the car, please?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|We\'re fine, officer. \'\'[Sips his beer.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|And-uhh who\'s, who\'s in here with you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Just me and my wife and my brother.

Kenny just laughs at the sight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kevin|Mom hit Dad again!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Both then continue laughing at them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Now, the first thing to do in domestic disturbance calls like this one is to just calm everybody down. Respect my authoritah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He jumps up and knocks Carol down, then Stuart. He then concentrates on Stuart. Kenny and Kevin keep laughing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Aagh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dispatcher 1|All units. All units. We have a 5-20 on the suspect. Report to the South Park petting zoo immediately!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Stops, gasps.]\'\' Chickenlover!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The petting zoo. The school kids mill among the animals.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Keep your eyes peeled, boys. Somebody\'s gonna make love to this chicken any minute.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The chicken blushes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Maybe we were wrong about the clue.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, maybe you read it wrong.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Oh, no!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Rustling is heard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Shhh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|They turn around. A hand reaches down and plucks the bird away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Keep your eyes peeled.}}\n{{ScriptScene|They turn around.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Feathers are flying out from behind a bush as the bush moves around.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He\'s here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Grab him!}}\n{{ScriptScene|All three rush the bush, meanwhile in Downtown South Park, Cartman is racing towards the zoo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dammit! Can\'t this thing go any faster?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Reaches for a doughnut and bites into it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The petting zoo. Barbrady is wrestling the Chickenlover as Kenny arrives. Barbrady finally gets his man. It seems to be the Booktastic bus driver, and he pulls out a pistol. As Barbrady takes it from him, it fires and hits Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[Gasps.]\'\' Oh my God, they\'ve killed--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[Gets up.]\'\' (Oh, it was only my jacket.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Goddammit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|I knew it was you all along, Richard Nixon!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Aw, I think that\'s a mask, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Whoa, dude! It\'s the bookmobile driver!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Caught you red-handed!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|Indeed, you did. How did you know I would strike here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|By reading \'\'Teetle the Timid Taxidermist\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|You did?! Really?! Then it worked! My whole plan worked absolutely perfectly! \'\'[Pleased.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What are you talking about, dude?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|When I heard that Officer Barbrady couldn\'t read, I knew I had to motivate him somehow. So I formulated a plan to encourage him to learn the magic of reading!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|So you fucked a bunch of chickens?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|Yes! Yes, exactly! Don\'t you see? Only by fucking chickens could I get Officer Barbrady to become literate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That doesn\'t... make a whole..lot of sense, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|Oh, no? He who was blind can now see!}}\n{{ScriptScene|No reaction from the kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|I got Officer Brabrady to read. My plan worked perfectly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Well, I guess I should say "Thanks?"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|You\'re welcome. And now, my reading friend, you\'ve proven that you are ready for the big time. I give you this hardback copy of \'\'Atlas Shrugged\'\', by Ayn Rand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Rushing up.]\'\' Freeze! Put your hands in the air!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I got reports that the suspect is \'\'in\'\' this area!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, he is. It turns out that the bookmobile driver here was the one making love to chickens.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|A-ha!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman hits him with the baton.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|Ow, that hurts!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Whoa, dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Officer Barbrady picks Cartman up and takes the baton from him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|No, no, that\'s \'\'not\'\' how you uphold the law! \'\'[He puts him down.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, \'\'he\'\' is not listening to my authoritah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|Oohhh, ohh, you\'ve got it all wrong, my little friend. You do it like this: \'\'[Paf.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bus Driver|\'\'[Going down, squealing.]\'\' Heee--!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|You\'ve gotta get \'em in the head; they go down quicker.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman looks at the driver and removes his shades.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ooohhhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I guess you should leave police work to the professionals, huh, Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|Well anyway, I\'m relieving you of your duties. I\'ve proved that I can read, and now I\'m back on the job!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He spins the cylinder on his pistol.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan/Kyle|Hooray!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman watches as Barbrady leaves the petting zoo, Stan calls out to Barbrady.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey! So what are you going to do now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|Now? \'\'[Turns around.]\'\' Well, I-ee uh... I think I\'ll get in the bathtub, and then curl up with a good book.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He displays the book for a moment, then holds up his right thumb for the camera to see. The end credits begin to roll, but only the executive producer is listed. The boys watch for a moment more, then walk off to the right. The chicken just walks around pecking at the straw. A bunny hops across the yard and Bebe chases after it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Newscast.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchor|And so today South Park held a parade to honor Officer Barbrady and his heroic work on the Chickenfucker case.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tape is shown of the parade. Confetti is flying everywhere. The South Park High School band is marching before Barbrady\'s car. He is in the car with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Thank you, everybody. Thank you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 1|Speech! Speech!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|\'\'[Lowers his arms.]\'\' What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|They want you to give a speech, Officer Barbrady; about the whole experience over the last couple of days.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Oh. Okay, uh... Well, first of all I\'d like to thank the town of South Park, the town that bore me and eventually will rob me of my life precious.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The town cheers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 2|Oh, yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Second, I\'d like to say to all those out there who think they can screw chickens just to teach people to read, your days are numbered! \'\'[More cheering.]\'\' And finally, I\'d like to say that \'\'[Enunciating.]\'\' reading totally sucks ass!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan/Kyle|Hooray!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Yes, at first, I was happy to be learning how to read. It seemed exciting and magical. But then I read this: \'\'Atlas Shrugged\'\', by Ayn Rand. I read every last word of this garbage, and because of this piece of sh-shit, I\'m never reading again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan, Kyle|Hooray for Barbrady!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd cheers again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wow! I guess reading really \'\'does\'\' suck ass!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ey, that\'s what I\'ve been saying all along, you guys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m just glad everything turned out okay, and Barbrady got his job back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s poetic justice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|\'\'[Leaning forward.]\'\' Thanks, boys.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The end credits roll again, this time normally. When the producer is listed, Kenny is shown in a clear area behind the crowd. A tree falls, flattening him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Ow!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Blood oozes from under the tree. End credits continue, showing more scenes from the parade.}}\n}}\n{{episodemedia02|episode=03}}\n[[zh:恋鸡狂/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Two]]'}]}}}}
