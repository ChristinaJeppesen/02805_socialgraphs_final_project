The Denver School Administration building is shown. Inside, the South Park School Board is meeting.

Jesus Christ, I\'m trying to teach history!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chairman|...Frankly, Mr. Garrison, it isn\'t even your educational record that we\'re most concerned about. \'\'[reviews a sheet of paper]\'\' It\'s your somewhat substantial police record.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[stomps his foot down]\'\' Oh, whatever!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|Mr. Garrison, last week\'s charges of attempting to solicit sex from a minor wa-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|That was not me, that was Mr. Hat! \'\'[points to his puppet]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Board Member|All we\'re saying is, perhaps you should take a little hiatus from teaching until this little \'\'[does quotes with two fingers on each hand]\'\' "child molestation" thing dies down a bit.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[rises from his chair]\'\' Gentlemen, teaching is all I know. It is the air that I breathe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chairman|We\'re sorry, Mr. Garrison, we have no choice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[crestfallen]\'\' Very well. I guess... I\'m not a teacher anymore. \'\'[approaches the chairman]\'\' I suppose you\'ll be wanting my badge and gun... \'\'[pulls them out and sets them on the table]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chairman|Mr. Garrison, most teachers do not carry a gun!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh, sorry.

We got a substitute teacher. \'\'[Kyle mumbles once more]\'\' Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|They say it\'s his kidneys.

They wanna have him go into surgery, but they\'re so dangerous.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Sheila, have you tried holistic natural medicines? They work wonders. I read all about in People.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Really? In People?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|There\'s a brand-new shop in town that sells holistic medicines and all-natural foods. It\'s run by this fascinating woman named "Miss Information."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Oh, well, with a name like "Miss Information" she must know something.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Why don\'t we at least take Kyle down there and see what she has to say.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Okay.

I\'m a womanizer sometimes, I know, but I just think that... taking a woman home and getting some hot poon is about the greatest thing in the world.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well that settles it, Mr. Garrison. What you need to do is go write a great romance novel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Yes, that\'s it. \'\'[sits up brightly]\'\' I am going to write the Great American Romance Novel!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Miss Information\'s New Age Shop. The sign is framed by two antlers and its entrance is a curtain of beads. In the picture window you see a pyramid with an eye on one side, a crystal ball and stand, a little elephant, and some charms. Outside, under the window, is a bed of flowers. Inside, Miss Information talks to Stan, Kyle, and their moms. Kyle looks fatigued}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|You see, the reason our body is stale is because of toxins.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Toxins?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|All the horrible food we eat—the sodas and meats are filled with toxins, and the only way for us to get better is to flush those toxins out of our system. Western medicine is so quick to cut and carve up, but all your son needs is a toxin-flushing diet of lemon juice and cayenne pepper.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Wow, that\'s amazing, Miss Information!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|You hear that, Kyle? You don\'t need surgery after all. \'\'[Kyle coughs]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh excuse me, but, what do these toxins look like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wuh, have you ever actually seen a toxin?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Don\'t be a smartass, Stanley.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|Mrs. Broflovski, I would like to give your son herbs that focus on the kidney. I have these excellent herbs from local Native Americans.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Ooo, Native Americans. Now, they know how to heal the body spiritually. \'\'[Kyle begins to babble]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison\'s house, night. A second-story window casts a shadow of Mr. Garrison at his laptop computer. He types and we hear the words as he says them in his mind...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\nOut on the balcony, when Reginald kissed Diana\'s lips, her knees went weak. Slowly, he pulled her top down, exposing her soft, unyielding breasts\nOh yeah, now this is getting good \'\'[sips some wine]\'\'\nJust the sight of those breasts made Reginald\'s penis very hard.\n\'\'[taps his chin with his left index finger. The computer screen is shown as the words are typed]\'\'\nHis penis was of considerable size, and now beads of sweat slowly ran down his\n\'\'[pauses]\'\'\npenis, making it glisten like a strong swimmer fresh from out of the pool. It was a fantastic penis, that seemed as strong as a horse\'s leg, yet as delicate as a flower wrapped in silk. What a grand, grand penis. Diana\'s nipples\n\'\'[music cuts off. He thinks]\'\' Uh, let\'s see... \'\'[taps his chin with his right index finger]\'\' Diana\'s nipples...\'\'[The words on the screen are shown halted at \'nipples\']\'\' \'\'[aloud]\'\' Oh, writer\'s block, writer\'s block!

She raises her arms and waves them over Kyle\'s body]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|Huuuuuuuuuh \'\'[lowers her arms]\'\' Oh, I don\'t agree. He seems much better.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|Yes, his chi is flowing much nicer than yesterday, and his aura is lighter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Oh, that\'s great news! \'\'[Kyle barfs and Stan steps out of the way]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Oh no!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|Nono, that\'s good. Those are the toxins flushing out of the system.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Ooooo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Those aren\'t toxins. That\'s the bean with bacon soup he ate half an hour ago.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley, what did I say about being a smartass?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t be a smartass?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miss Information|Now, don\'t be fooled. As Kyle\'s body sheds itself more and more of all the toxins he will appear to be getting worse, but actually, he is getting better!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Wow. Well, I am on natural medicines. If only I had known sooner.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Other mothers|\'\'[ad lib]\'\' I agree. Yeah. That\'s right. \'\'[Stan looks defeated]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, day.

I think he\'s really, really sick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|He is really, really sick, Stanley. I was seeing him last week when he first got ill, but unfortunately his mother has decided to put all her trust into holistic medicine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But I don\'t think it\'s working.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|Alright, Stanley, I\'m going to be very honest with you. Your little friend Kyle needs a kidney transplant. Or it is very possible that... he will die.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[overwhelmed]\'\' Die? But... Kyle\'s my best friend. In the whole world.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|I know this is a lot to lay on someone your age, but... the rest of the town is so gung-ho in New Age medicine that I have nowhere else to turn.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...I\'ll give Kyle my kidney, even if it hurts a whole lot; I don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Doctor|That\'s very brave, Stan, but I\'ve already checked my records, and you and Kyle aren\'t a match for kidneys.
