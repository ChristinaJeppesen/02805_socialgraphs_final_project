Anything you want, Mr. Cruise.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|It\'s just that there\'s somebody that I have always wanted to meet... face to face. If you could get him to show up in your town-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Sure! Who is it? We can get anybody for you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Muhammad. The prophet of the Muslim faith.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ooooooo...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|That\'s... tricky...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Well, then you can just get sued! \'\'[Returns to packing fudge]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Mr. Cruise, if there is anybody else we could bring to town, we-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|No! Just him. You get Muhammad to appear in South Park, or your little town is DONE!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Town Meeting Hall. Angry chatter is heard while Randy is speaking to the audience, with Principal Victoria, Mr. Mackey, Mayor and her aides sitting on chairs beside him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Okay, people, I know, I know. But he will get the other celebrities to withdraw their lawsuit if we just... get Muhammad to appear in South Park.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Are you nuts? If Muhammad appears in South Park, we get bombed! \'\'[audience shouts in agreement]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|We don\'t know that. Maybe enough time has passed, and now it\'s now OKAY to show Muhammad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[to Tolkien]\'\' Dude, I can\'t believe we are dealing with this Muhammad thing again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|But even if it were safe for Muhammad come, how would we ever find him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sgt. Yates|Yeah, showing an image of him is completely off limits and censored, so nobody has seen what Muhammad looks like. \'\'[shows the whole audience. Stan in the middle raises his hand]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I saw him once. \'\'[everyone turns towards Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|McDaniels|\'\'[steps forward]\'\' You did?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, a while ago, my friends joined David Blaine\'s cult, and I had to go to the Super Best Friends to rescue them, Muhammad was one of the Super Best Friends.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Oh, and what- he was just out in the open where everybody could see him and nobody got bombed?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, dude, it was totally fine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sgt. Yates|Muhammad showed up and there was no violence at all?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, a giant John Wilkes Booth shot Abraham Lincoln...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Alright, Stan, that\'s enough. Jesus, can\'t learn to shut up, can you? Now look, I believe we CAN find Muhammad. I\'ve done a lot of research and I have completed a sketch of what Muhammad might look like today. \'\'[holds up a file and begins to open it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|No, don\'t! \'\'[Randy holds it up to reveal a poorly drawn stick figure]\'\' Is that okay to show?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|I don\'t know. I guess we\'ll see.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tom Cruise\'s Lodge}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Hillary Clinton|Tom, what is up with this Muhammad thing? It doesn\'t make sense!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesse Jackson|Yeah, you said we were just suing South Park.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|No, I said we were going to use South Park to make sure we never got ripped on again. Look, people, all of us get ridiculed, but who is the one person on this earth who is completely free from slander?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Oprah Winfrey|You want Muhammad because he can\'t be ridiculed?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Muhammad has a power that makes him impervious to being made fun of. What if we could harness that power? \'\'[moves over to Jimmy Buffet]\'\' Jimmy Buffet, how would you like it if nobody could call your music drunken frat boy monkey garbage?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy Buffett|I... I\'d love it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|By taking what Muhammad has, we could all be safe from ridicule. \'\'[walks to the bar next to Tim Burton]\'\' Like Tim Burton here. Imagine it Tim; nobody could rip on you for all the rehashed movies you\'ve made lately. There\'d never be a TV show that pointed out that you have never had an original idea since \'\'Beetlejuice\'\'. And, you put Johnny Depp and the same crappy music in every film. And if you\'re that in love with Johnny Depp, you should just have sex with him already. A TV show could never say that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tim Burton|Gee, that\'d be swell.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Well it can be a reality. Once we have Muhammad, we can take his power from him. \'\'[Cartman walks in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Excuse me... \'\'[the celebrities turn around]\'\' This is the home of Tom Cruise, right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Hey! It\'s one of the boys from South Park who slandered me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I didn\'t come for myself. I\'m just an escort for another celebrity who wants to get in on your lawsuit...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Richards|Who? \'\'[Cartman lifts up his hand and takes off his glove, revealing fake hair and painted on lips.

Muhammad cannot make public appearances.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Buddha|We simply cannot risk any violence from the Muslim people}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Awww, not you guys too... Jesus fucking Christ!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Narrator|Later, at the hall of the Super Best Friends...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay, will you let Muhammad come to South Park if we dress him like a pirate?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joseph Smith|No, Muslims would still be angry if you showed his face.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|K... what if we cover his face with a paper bag?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lao Tzu|No, \'cause you would still be showing him walking around, that could be a-trouble.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay. A suit of armor? We just have Muhammad in a suit of armor so you can\'t see anything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|But it\'s still Muhammad walking around in human form.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Aww, come on! This is ridiculous! \'\'[pounds hands on table]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joseph Smith|Boys, you need to understand that people get very offended when Muhammad is mocked because he is a religious figure. \'\'[snorting noise, Buddha is snorting cocaine]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Buddha, don\'t do coke in front of kids! \'\'[Kyle and Stan stare open mouthed for a second]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|A U-Haul. What if we bring Muhammad to South Park in the back of a U-Haul, and he just stays in there out of sight?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Joseph Smith|But he\'s talking from the U-Haul?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well yeah, he\'s got to talk or nobody knows he\'s in there!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Hearing his voice, I don\'t know. What do you think Moses? \'\'[Moses is floating over in the previously unseen corner]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Moses|Um... would there be windows on the U-Haul?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There doesn\'t have to be...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Moses|Um... I guess... I guess that would be okay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tom Cruises Lodge, celebrities file into a large room which has a machine on the wall}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Here it is friends. Once we have Muhammad, this machine will give us the power to not be made fun of.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Russel Crowe|Tom, Tom, you\'re talkin\' crazy, mate. Only Muhammad has that ability, how could we ever get it from him? \'\'[Rob Reiner walks in with a huge sandwich and handkerchief]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rob Reiner|We take his goo! It\'s as simple as that people. \'\'[takes a bite and wipes forehead, then walks over near Tom Cruise]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Rob Reiner has been telling me about the goo that is inside every person on earth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rob Reiner|Any goo can be harvested from a person\'s body, and easily placed into another. \'\'[wipes forehead, holds up his hand, but speaks to himself]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wait, you mean we aren\'t going to sue and get a bunch of money?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|No Jen, we\'ve all got enough money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jennifer Lopez|Yes, who needs more money, we need to get Muhammad\'s goo!

Hell, I got people in Hong Kong who\'ll give me 50 mil for that goo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So we let them take it from Muhammad, then we take it for ourselves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|You catch on quick kid... \'\'[knock at the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|\'\'[from the other side of the door]\'\' Mrs. Lopez...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mitch Conner|Hurry, get my wig back on! \'\'[Tom opens the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Cruise|Hey, I was just seeing if you needed some- Oh, god \'\'[scratches the back of his head guiltily]\'\' you found my fudge packing uniform...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jennifer Lopez|Oh, yes, your secret is safe with me, Tommy!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside South Park Town Hall, several townspeople are standing around}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Boys, we are so sorry for doubting you.
