Okay? Swimming around in the water. And then one day a couple of fish had a retard baby, and the retard baby was different, so it got to live. So Retard Fish goes on to make more retard babies, and then one day, a retard baby fish crawled out of the ocean with its \'\'[waves his left hand limply]\'\' mutant fish hands... and it had butt sex with a squirrel or something and made this. \'\'[points to a rodent]\'\' retard frog squirrel, and then \'\'that\'\' had a retard baby which was a... monkey fish-frog... And then this monkey fish-frog had butt sex with that monkey, and... that monkey had a mutant retard baby that screwed another monkey and... that made you! \'\'[faces the class.

He gets up and walks to the wall calendar, where he has Nov. 19 marked - a Sunday, the day the Wii comes out. Halloween is marked off, so it\'s now less than three weeks. He logs onto the Internet and fires up his browser - he gets an ad for the Wii, coming in three weeks. He\'s now downstairs watching early-morning TV.
