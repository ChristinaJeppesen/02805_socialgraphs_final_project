A bunch of men are gathered at the bar chatting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Darryl|I\'m telling you guys, you\'ve got to see this.

You gotta check it out! \'\'[the wrestling coach is sitting nearby, stewing at the conversation]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Darryl|You can watch \'em almost every afternoon.

But I guess that\'s just \'\'[holds up two fingers on each hand in a quote gesture]\'\' "not real" to you! \'\'[turns and walks back to the bar, saying under his breath]\'\' Son of a bitch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Coach|Look look look! \'\'[whips out his iPhone to show them]\'\' THIS is wrestling. THIS. \'\'[two men are shown wrestling in Greco-Roman style. There\'s a lot of grunting in the match.

One! Two!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|Backyard wrestling!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s backyard, moments later. The yard has been transformed into a Greek amphitheater. A façade now covers the back side of the house and a wrestling ring is in the amphitheater\'s pit. The place looks filled to capacity with people chattering, waiting for the matches to begin. The amphitheater lights dim and the crowd cheers as the wrestlers come out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh what a perfect night for fighting. Lo, the moon sets upon the tips of the trees and I, the man known as the Rad Russian, start to stir with the excitement of violence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Only a country like yours can breed men of such discontent, Rad Russian. But you don\'t know what real pain is! PAIN! Like I\'ve known. Abandoned when I was four years old by my parents.

Why?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|The school board has decided to discontinue the wrestling program.

THIS ISN\'T WRASSLING!

Sure, that works.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[rushing in with a letter]\'\' You guys! You guys, listen to this! It\'s amazing!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What dude? \'\'[the other boys gather \'round]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We just received a letter from the WWE.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|From the professional wrestlers we saw in Denver?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|No way!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|"Gentlemen, We have heard of your wrestling organization and are quite interested in its popularity. The WWE is delighted to inform you that it will be sending a talent scout, President Vince McMahon to view your wrestling event this Saturday the twenty-fourth."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Vince McMahon is coming to see us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|This is our shot at making it into the WWE.

Omigod!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay guys! Guys, listen! We seriously have to focus here! We have exactly three days before the scout is here to see us wrestle. We gotta step it up and work it like never before.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright it\'s time to start the second act. Let\'s bring the crowd back in from intermission and then improvise some stuff for Saturday!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Intermission. The crowd is milling around in the front lawn, and the darkened amphitheater is visible behind the fence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Darryl|Yeah, no I I think Congo is a great wrestler; I just think Rad Russian has his number.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Redneck 19|Yeah, but Rad Russian has a lot of abandonment issues. \'\'[a chime sounds, indicating the start of the second act]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Darryl|Uh oh, it looks like the intermission is over, better head back.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The amphitheater. The lights come up on Kyle in the ring, who begins to speak.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I left my wife today. Walked out of the apartment without saying a word. I ran away from my responsibilities... just like I always do. \'\'[an elderly fan holds up a sign: "STOP RUNNING JUGGERNAUT"]\'\' And I, again, am alone. \'\'[Stan, Butters, and Tolkien climb into the ring behind him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Here he is, hiding in the forest as I told you. \'\'[Kyle turns to see the other three boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Juggernaut! There is to be an Ultimate Smackdown this Saturday!

I\'m sure you\'re wondering why I\'ve called you here to Sizzler.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, what\'s this about? We should be writing our monologues for Smackdown.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well guys, Kenny and I have been talking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah, we\'ve been talking.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|And, I mean, Smackdown might be our one shot at making it into the WWE, right? I mean a shot like this might never come again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, the way we see it, we have three primary obstacles in making Smackdown a great show: Tolkien, Butters, Jimmy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yep.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What are you talking about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Guys, let\'s face it: they can\'t wrestle for crap! I mean, \'\'every time\'\' I wrestle with one of them, they flub a line or blow their monologue. And Tolkien? He has no emotion, no timing, he\'s the worst wrestler I\'ve ever seen!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, it\'s really hard to do your best wrestling when you\'re up against Tolkien.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|And Butters and Jimmy I mean, they\'re okay but, they\'re never gonna make it as professional wrestlers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, so then WWE will recruit us and not them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No dude, they\'re gonna hurt our chances.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(They\'re gonna hurt \'\'our\'\' chances.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Because we all know that the new material I\'ve written is stuff those guys can\'t handle, and we\'ll suffer from it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|So what do we do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(We\'ve gotta bring somebody else on.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yep. We\'ve gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Somebody who can do the harder stuff we\'ve written so that Tolkien, Butters, and Jimmy can have smaller parts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|How do we find somebody who can wrestle that well?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s simple. We just gotta hold tryouts.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tryouts, later on. Syncopated music plays, similar to "All That Jazz."

What can you tell us about yourself?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Number 37|Not a whole lot to tell, really. Was born in Fort Collins, started watching wrestling when I was four years old.

Who is that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s \'\'Triceratops\'\', and he\'s with Irene. \'\'[Coach Connors sneaks up to the side of Cartman\'s house with a briefcase and puts his back up against the wall]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You aren\'t welcome here, \'\'Triceratops\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|My man can do whatever he wants.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|Stay calm, you know what you have to do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You\'re just gonna have to deal with that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|For the good of real wrassling. \'\'[quickly moves away and out of sight]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|No Irene, please! Just this once, do not abort this baby!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|My body, my rights! In fact, I\'m jonesing for the rush so badly, I don\'t think I\'ll make it to the clinic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, you can\'t possibly mean that-!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes! I think maybe I\'ll have another abortion! Right here, right now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|Awwwww!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There\'s someone here to wrestle \'\'you\'\', Irene! A baby you aborted many years ago survived! And he\'s here now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Number 37|\'\'[leaps into view in yellow tights and red boots]\'\' Mother! Why did you abort me? Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Redneck 21|He\'s alive!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You! Get back in the trashcan where you belong!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The opera box.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Assistant|What do you think?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Irene, there\'s no way we could let you here, and I\'d let you do something informal like that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Vince|They are decent wrestlers. We\'ll see how they develop their through lines in the second act. \'\'[whips out some opera glasses and puts them on]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Under the bleachers.

I thought I would find you here, \'\'Triceratops\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Stay out of my business Sergeant Hammerclaw! You just stay out of my way!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard|\'\'[catching up to the coach]\'\' Excuse me. I\'m sorry, I\'m afraid this area is off limits.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[after Jimmy says something]\'\' Are you sure?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|Oh don\'t mind me. \'\'[puts down his briefcase]\'\' I was just about to- \'\'[quickly gets the guard to the ground and takes up the starting position of wrassling.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard|\'\'[seems to be enjoying all the moves and grunts the coach is making]\'\' Heh whoa-ho! Heh hey! Whoawhoawhoa. Whoahoho. Eheheh. The fuck is this?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The backyard amphitheater. The next segment begins with the Rad Russian holding court while the other wrestlers sway to the music behind him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|O, how I long for the spring meadows of Russia! The soft Russian sky!}}\n{{ScriptScene|An upper floor under the bleachers. The coach climbs up a ladder to this floor and sets his briefcase down. He opens the case and assembles the rocket-propeled grenade launcher inside it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|When are you going to face reality, Congo? Just because you were raised by panthers doesn\'t mean you are one!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|He\'s closer to a panther than you\'ll ever be!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Lies! These are all a bunch of lies! \'\'[back to the ring. Kenny has a bloody baby doll under his left arm. A fake umbilical cord is attached to it]\'\' Now you listen here, El, Pollo Loco! It doesn\'t matter if your wife was killed, you cannot keep Irene\'s aborted baby!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(I can keep the baby...)}}\n{{ScriptScene|The railing at the very top of the amphitheater, behind the topmost seats. The coach climbs up and over it with his RPGL.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Just let them crawl back to Mexico Sergeant Hammerclaw. \'\'[The coach picks up the RPGL, puts it on his shoulder, and takes aim]\'\' We can\'t... might as well go back to your land of burritos, tacos, and take this aborted baby where it will fit in right with all the other aborted babies in Mexico!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|\'\'[while Cartman speaks]\'\' Only one shot. \'\'[moves his aim from the ring to the opera box]\'\' Maximum damage. \'\'[zooms in on McMahon]\'\' This is all your fault, you WWE president asshole! Your fault we all die here. Right. Now. FOR WRASSLING! \'\'[fires the launcher and the rocket takes off. It goes towards the façade, but stops and drops harmlessly into the ring]\'\' NO! \'\'[Kenny picks it up. It comes back to life and takes off with him holding on. They go all over the place, but finally take off into the sky, where the grenade blows up and releases fireworks. Below, Mexican fans of El Pollo Loco hold up banners: "Viva El Pollo Loco" "Me Gusta El Pollo Loco"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fan 1|O dios mio, mataron al Pollo Loco!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fan 2|Bastardos! \'\'[Kenny\'s theme music comes up as the fireworks continue coming down.

No, shut up! \'\'[steps into the ring]\'\' You idiots want wrassling?! This is wrassling! \'\'[performs some wrestling stances and grunts, but gets booed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Redneck 22|We want some real wrestlers!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|This is just a bunch of garbage!

Get off the wrestlin\' mat! Boo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|Why do I care? These kids made it so real wrassling is gone from schools! It\'s practically gone from the culture.

Sshh. \'\'[the crowd falls silent, waiting for his next words]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|You want to know pain? Pain is dedicating your entire life to a sport, to a career, and then having it all \'\'ripped away\'\' from you like a babe from its mother.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Darryl|Oh man, they took his job?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Redneck 13|They took hid-drr.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Conners|Lost everything!

Nothing! Not even the will to live. \'\'[He closes his eyes. The crowd takes it in, applauds, then gives him a standing ovation. He opens his eyes, surprised at the reaction.
