Ours is still alive!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|\'\'[walks up and looks]\'\' Oh, hold on. \'\'[walks away. The manatee raises its head. Ms. Choksondik returns with a brick and brings it down hard on the manatee\'s head twice, killing it and exposing its brain. Butters is stunned.

He pulls out some Pop Toasties and puts them in a toaster, gets some powdered chocolate milk and a stick of butter, rolls the butter in the powdered milk, gets the Pop Toasties, and places the chocolate-covered butter between the two Pop Toasties. He squeezes down for good measure and makes his way out of the kitchen.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Cartman house, living room.

All you gotta do is eat it very fast!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[off-screen, enticing]\'\' Forty-one bucks. \'\'[Kenny jumps up and starts eating it. The others groan and moan]\'\' Eww-ho-hoo!

Over the next few weeks we\'re gonna learn that losing weight is \'\'[jumps] fun\'\', right gang?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Taller Boy|Right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|Wait a second. \'\'[holds his right hand to his ear]\'\' Do you kids hear something? \'\'[drops his hand]\'\' I could\'ve swore that-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pink Monster|Raaarrrr!!! \'\'[a woman in costume]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|Oh no, kids!

Because that glutinous fat was really our good friend, Susan, \'\'[she pops out of the costume]\'\' who\'s another weight counselor! \'\'[she jumps out in front of the costume and exults]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Taller Boy|Heh! It was a lady in a costume!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[miffed]\'\' Would somebody put this retard out of his misery?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day, playground. Stan and Pip stand by Kenny, who\'s groaning in pain and holding his stomach.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[walks up with Butters]\'\' What\'s the matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kenny\'s not feeling so good. That manatee spleen made him sick. \'\'[Clyde and Tolkien come in from the right, Wendy and Bebe come in from the left. Stan comforts Kenny.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Uh oh. I guess we shouldn\'t have made him eat it. \'\'[Stan jumps back as Kenny starts vomiting the spleen up.

People are willing to pay big money to see Kenny do this stuff.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hopeful Hills Children\'s Weight Management Center, later. The counselors come up over a hill and down the other side jogging. They stop}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|Doing great kids! Come on! \'\'[they resume jogging and the fat kids lumber to the top of the hill panting behind them. Cartman stops and droops]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[resumes jogging]\'\' This... is... bullcrap!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hopeful Hills Children\'s Weight Management Center, mess hall, after dinner.

This is it. I\'m going to die here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Susan|\'\'[cheerfully arrives with a loaded plate]\'\' I hope you all left room for dessert.

I can\'t eat this crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Blonde Girl|\'\'[to Cartman\'s right]\'\' Me neither. I have to have sugar or I\'m going to \'\'die.\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[to the girl]\'\' Yeah, well, when I was in prison, we used to sneak stuff in by hiding it up our ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brunet Boy|I have some Fudge \'Ems up my ass. You want some?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Psss. Yeah, I\'m not falling for that one again!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hopeful Hills Children\'s Weight Management Center, night. Cartman sneaks out and creeps along the side of the campers\' cabin}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright, Clyde Frog. We just gotta clear the counselor building and we\'re free. \'\'[sees the entrance and races for it. He exits and races through the meadow until he reaches a road.]\'\' We did it, Clyde Frog! Now the only question is, do we go home to our traitor moms and friends, or do we start a new life on the run? \'\'[an ice cream truck approaches him]\'\' An ice cream truck! Hey wait! \'\'[races up to the truck. The driver exits the cab]\'\' Boy, am I glad to see you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|Can I interest you in some ice cream?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You\'re \'\'damn right\'\' you can! Two Roller Pops, please!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|\'\'[goes to the back of the truck, opens the doors, and pulls out one pop.]\'\' Alrighty, do you want this kind or this kind? \'\'[points to the inside of the truck. Cartman looks]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hunh? \'\'[is lifted up]\'\' Uuh! \'\'[and tossed into the truck. The doors are closed behind him, and he looks up.

The campers\' cabin door is opened and the five escapees return to their bunks}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 1|They always get us. Sometimes it\'s a ice cream truck, sometimes it\'s a taco stand. But they always fool us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Taller Boy|Heh-I can\'t help it. I\'d give anything. Any amount of money for some candy. \'\'[Rick and Susan pop into the campers\' cabin.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|Hey kids!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Susan|Looks like we had some attempted escapees again tonight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|Escape-aroo! Now campers, I know that camp is tough, but you have to believe that you can do it. And you have to know that until you drop the weight, you can\'t leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Susan|\'\'[bends forward sweetly a bit and cocks her head to the left]\'\' There \'\'is\'\' no escape.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|So let\'s just all put on our try-hard helmets, and accept that the only way for us to get out of camp, is to LOSE THE WEIGHT!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Eric|\'\'[pissed off]\'\' Aw, damnit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, the Cartman house. Butters and Timmy have replaced Cartman in the boy\'s group for now, and they stand in front of the Broflovski parents, Mr. Mackey, Mr. Garrison, Sharon March, Principal Victoria, and Dr. Doctor.

There must have been enough to last an Eskimo family months.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|New Cartman|You know, Kyle? There was a time when your fat jokes would have gotten to me. But now I\'m totally slim and totally happy! In fact, I\'d say I\'m \'\'[leans a bit to eye Kyle\'s belly]\'\' a little bit trimmer than you, fatboy! \'\'[stands erect]\'\' Heh heh. Just kidding, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|I made some healthy tofu pudding to celebrate.

Let\'s hear it for Eric Cartman! \'\'[the studio audience applauds]\'\' Well, our second guest tonight is a young man named Kenny McCormick, who is going to eat dog crap. Kenny? \'\'[Kenny enters with Stan, Kyle, and a dog. Music begins as a spotlight falls on Kenny. The dog turns his ass to Kenny and craps. A musical riff plays as Kenny picks the crap up and the audience groans with disgust. Some of them cover their eyes. Kenny lifts the crap dramatically into the air a wailing female joins the music. Another riff plays as Kenny swallows the crap. A small pedestal appears under him and pushes him up and around. The audience groans some more, Kenny finishes off the crap, and the audience beings to cheer. The new Cartman is pissed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|New Cartman|God-damnit, all \'\'I\'\' got was a little golf clap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|\'\'[hesitant]\'\' Thanks for coming on the show, Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[gracious]\'\' (Sure!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 1|Do it again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 2|Do it again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 3|Hey kid!

Why not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Because Kenny is only doing things that anybody could do. For money.

Am I?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, no, uh of course Kenny is not a prostitute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, because, children, a prostitute is someone who... you could pay for certain services.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Like what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Like keeping you company.
