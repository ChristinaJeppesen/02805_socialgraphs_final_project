In sand. \'\'[flips a board over to reveal his plan for disavowing any knowledge of the episode]\'\' We take twenty to twenty-five dump trucks, fill them with sand from Monarch Lake, and then dump the sand along South Park Avenue. By using approximately eighteen dozen shovels, we can each dig a hole in the sand, stick our heads in the holes, and then have the person to our left bury them.
