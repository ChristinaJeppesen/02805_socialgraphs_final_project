But the way that I lost so \'\'much\'\' weight was that I got aides.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|A- AIDS?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|That\'s right. I got aides about two years ago and I\'ve been losing weight ever since.

Hooray for aides!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, that\'s not really what you say in the commercial.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|I know. You kinda have to read the fine print at the bottom of the screen. It says I only ate a half-sized lean turkey sandwich with no mustard or mayo or anything like that and then had proper diet and exercise aides.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But you\'re lying to people. If they knew that you didn\'t eat just all the sandwiches you want, you might not be so popular.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|Y- you think so. Well, why... should it matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It matters, dude. \'\'[Jared begins to think...]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|Hmmm.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Main Street, moments later. The boys walk along...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That penisbutt didn\'t lose weight eating sub sandwiches.

I think I\'m having a genius moment. Yes. Yes! Its coming to me now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Tha- that\'s diarrhea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Noo. Don\'t you see what this all means? Anybody could do what he did. What\'s to stop someone else from going to say, City Wok, and cutting a deal with them? Say they\'ll eat nothing but their Chinese food, but then eat only a little tiny bit of it and exercise.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[following]\'\' Then City Wok could say \'\'their\'\' food makes them lose weight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[softly]\'\' That\'s right Stan. \'\'[bolder]\'\' It\'s a cash cow, I tell you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s a great idea!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Lose weight and make money...

You can\'t slim down bones, stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But Butters isn\'t fat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s my whole point. First we fatten him up, then we make the deal with City Wok, then take the weight back off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s right. If Butters is naturally skinny, he\'ll be able to take the weight off faster.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|But fellas, if I get fat my parents will ground me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, come on! Just think about how famous you\'ll be!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|You mean like Jared?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah dude! You\'ll be just like Jared!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[angrily]\'\' Well the heck with that! You said Jared was a penis-butt!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You wouldn\'t be a penis-butt, Butters, you\'d be famous.

But uh... some young boys were talkin\' to me earlier, and... it made me think that people might not be so proud of my weight loss if they knew something.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Christine|Jared, what\'s this all about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|Uh, Christine, this isn\'t probably gonna matter to you at all, but... I have aides.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Christine|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|Yeah, I have aides. I\'ve had aides since before we were together. \'\'[Christine\'s jaw drops]\'\' What, what are you thinking?

I \'\'slept\'\' with you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|Aren\'t you overreacting a little bit?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Christine|Well, Jesus Christ! We\'re supposed to get married!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|We can still get married Christine, I mean, sure, they\'re \'\'my\'\' aides now, but after we get married... they\'ll be \'\'our\'\' aides \'\'[Christine sobs]\'\' You\'ll love having aides, Christine, you really will. And when we have children, \'\'they\'ll\'\' have aides. It\'ll make things so simple! \'\'[Christine throws up her arms, rises from her chair, and runs out of the restaurant sobbing]\'\' Christine! \'\'[rises and moves to follow Christine, but stops to think]\'\' Jeez, those boys were right.

The boys enter the kitchen to get their meals.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Hello there, children.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Chef, we need Butters to gain about fifty pounds fast.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Fifty pounds? Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uuuh, school project.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, if you want him to get \'\'really\'\' fat as fast as possible, one of you will have to marry him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Marry him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|It definitely worked for every \'\'woman\'\' I ever met.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, no, no, no!

Here, have some more mayonnaise. \'\'[scoops out a tablespoon and hands it to Butters, but Butters doesn\'t take it.

You shouldn\'t joke about Kenny being dead. Enough time hasn\'t passed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So how long until we can joke about it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Twenty-two point three years. That\'s how long it takes for something tragic to become funny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wugh, that\'s a long time to wait.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wull I can\'t eat no more. I-I just keep pukin\' it up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Then eat your puke.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, come on!

And so, with all the money I\'ve made from commercials, I have decided to start the Aides for Everyone Foundation!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|I am going to personally see to it that each and every one of you gets aides! \'\'[a long silence follows as the audience just looks at Jared]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|This guy\'s insane.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jared|But I won\'t stop there.

Cartman moves to the sofa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Eh. \'\'[makes himself comfortable on the sofa and turns on the TV. He grunts a bit]\'\' Eh. Yeah. \'\'[the phone rings; he answers]\'\' Well hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|\'\'[at an office full of cubicles]\'\' I\'m just checking in on you, Butters. \'\'[a woman walks down the aisle behind him]\'\' Uh, do I hear the television?

AIDS is finally funny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|People in Crowd|Alright! Yay!

The field reporter resumes reporting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Tom, I\'m standing in the town square where just moments ago it was declared that AIDS... can finally be joked about. What a great day for humanity.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Herbert Garrison|\'\'[laughs, then]\'\' "AIDS quilt" \'\'[resumes laughing.

The boys just look at him oddly]\'\' AIDS so funny! \'\'[walks away laughing]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, so much for our money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, but you know, I\'ve learned something today. It would have been wrong to exploit Butters\' weight loss. Because then lots of fat people would have believed it. And then gone and eaten a ton of Chinese food instead of dieting properly. They\'d still be fat and, we\'d be responsible for their shattered dreams.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, I don\'t like shattering fat peoples\' dreams. Besides, I\'d get grounded. \'\'[gasps]\'\' Oh, Jesus! I\'m supposed to be grounded! \'\'[rushes away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, minutes later. Butters rushes to the front door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Huh. Huh, uh, uh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[opens the door in anticipation]\'\' There you are, Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[nervous]\'\' Wuh-are my... mom and dad back home yet?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, but they\'re due home any minute.

They completely believed I was you on the phone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hu-oh! Goody!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Here you go. \'\'[hands Butters some drawings]\'\' I drew some pictures with crayons so it looks like you were here all day. And I ate a little food so it looks like you ate, and I fed your cat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh- perfect.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright I\'d better get out of here before they get back. \'\'[makes his way to the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh hey, uh Eric? \'\'[Cartman turns around]\'\' Uh- thanks for coverin\' for me. You\'re a real pal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters, it was my pleasure. \'\'[pulls out his mittens and opens the door, then puts them on. He heads for the sidewalk humming a late night theme song, then turns around to frame the house with his fingers, then walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, outside. Cartman, still humming, returns with a beach chair, some popcorn, and soda, and sets them up on the front lawn. He then sits down to watch the coming show. Two cars pull up; it\'s Butters\' parents rushing home. They exit their cars and angrily head for the door. They enter...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hi, Mom and Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Don\'t you "Hi, Mom and Dad" us, you little punk!!! \'\'[Punch]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Ow!
