Uh, the best thing is to be genuinely nice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, so how do you act \'\'genuinely\'\' nice to people?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, Eric, pah part of being nice is just making people smile and laugh. The best way to do that is by telling a fan-tastic joke or a humorous anti-d- ant\'duhh ...anecdote.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Like what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, like, try this one on for size: Knock knock.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Who\'s there?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Ing-mar ...Bergman. \'\'[Cartman jumps, but not because of the joke.

I, I did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So, fine, Kyle, but honestly, I never meant to make you feel like you didn\'t matter at all to me. I know we argue all the time and I give you tons of crap, but we\'ve also been through a, a lot together, and... maybe that alone doesn\'t make us friends, but it makes us something. So, ...whatever, you know, just... ah I hope... things will be cool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'m still not inviting you to Casa Bonita.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I know, Kyle.

Ah uh I still have to take Butters, but... I hope things can be cool too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And, and hey, if for some reason Butters can\'t go to Casa Bonita, you can take his place.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sweet, whatever. \'\'[walks on, then mouths to himself]\'\' Bingo!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, Friday night.

I ...\'\'pray\'\' that I\'m wrong, but, I just want you to take a look and... see what you think. \'\'[backs up and looks through the eyepiece]\'\' Do you see anything?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I just see stars. \'\'[Cartman hops onto a chair and fishes in his left jacket pocket.

It is getting closer! Oh my God!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my God! That meteor is the size of Wyoming and it\'s on a collision course for Earth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|When do you think uh it\'ll get here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I, I don\'t know, I, have to do some calculations. \'\'[heads for his desk and pulls out a calculator]\'\' 10 to the power of 1 base 9 divided by pi plus 5 minus 3.

No, Butters, we are going to live! Do you hear me?! We are going to live! We just... We\'ve gotta find a bomb shelter!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wha...?

Oh Jesus! \'\'[Cartman watches him, then follows him down the ladder]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[reaches the shelter floor]\'\' All right, we should be safe in here. This dried food and water should last us for weeks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|But what about everyone else? I have to tell my parents so they can come here, too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No! Butters! I can\'t let you risk it. I\'ll go up and get the others.}} \n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Are you sure?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[looks away]\'\' I\'m not sure of anything anymore. \'\'[turns and climbs up the ladder.

If I don\'t make it back in time with the others, then it will be up to you to repopulate the Earth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|But I\'m the only one down here. What am I supposed to repopulate with?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, you know, with your wiener. \'\'[Butters just stares back]\'\' Just stay down here until you hear word from me.

I\'ll break off the handle so nobody can get to you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Aren\'t you coming?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Too late for me. I can already feel my... body start to... change. \'\'[begins to "change"]\'\' No! Must... fight... it... Don\'t open this door for anybody, Butters! No matter what you hear, stay inside for four days! Here\'s some water and food from the shelter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Eric, you\'re the ...best friend in the whole world. I... I love you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I love you too, man. I just \'\'[goes into spasms]\'\' You look so delicious! Must eat your brains! \'\'[lunges at Butters, who quickly closes the refrigerator door. Cartman walks up and rips off the door handle, then walks away chuckling to himself. A few seconds later a garbage truck backs up and removes the refrigerator from the gas station]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, next day. Cartman is happily asleep in his bed and his alarm goes off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hah! \'\'[turns off his bear alarm clock, hops out of bed cheerfully and skips to his wall calendar he made just for the occasion.]\'\' It\'s Wednesday! It\'s Wednesday! \'\'[crosses off Tuesday on his calendar]\'\' Only three more days till Casa Bonita. I\'m gonna go through Black Bart\'s Cave first. No! I\'m gonna watch the cliff divers first! Maybe if I tell them it\'s \'\'my\'\' birthday, they\'ll let me cliff-dive in the pool! \'\'[walks off to get dressed]\'\' Oh, that would be so bad-ass!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Trash Dump, night. The refrigerator is now there and begins to heave. Butters kicks his way out of it, having run out of air.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[rises, catches his breath, and dusts himself off]\'\' Finally I can breathe a- \'\'[looks at the apparent devastation around him]\'\' Oh my God. Oh my God, the meteor took out everything! It\'s all destroyed. Nothing left. \'\'[walks forth]\'\' Hello? Are there any, are there any other survivors? Hello? Oh. That must have been where the library was. And that was probably the school. Hello? \'\'[rustling sounds are heard and he tenses up in fear, then softly]\'\' Oh. I forgot, I gotta watch out for radioactive cannibals. \'\'[more loudly]\'\' Is that a cannibal? Sir? Ma\'am? \'\'[he watches, and a dog emerges from the rubble]\'\' Oh. Aww, it\'s a little dog. \'\'[approaches the mutt]\'\' Well, hello there, Mr. Dog. Looks like you and me are the only ones who survive the meteor, heh. We should stick together, huh, Mr. Dog? Well come on, we gotta start cleanin\' up this mess, and rebuild this civilization. Boy, that meteor sure did make everything stinky. \'\'[walks into the rubble and begins his work]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, day. On the highway, Sheila drives the boys towards their destination. All the boys are now wearing suits instead of sweaters. Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sit in the back seat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'We\'re on our way to Casa Bonita! We\'re gonna be there very soon.\'\' You\'re gonna love Casa Bonita, Stan. There, there\'s this one part where you can dress up in Old Western clothes and get your photo taken in a fake jail.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, it\'s pretty cool.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[sniffs]\'\' "Pretty cool." So, um, should we go to Black Bart\'s Cave first or watch the puppet show? I think we should go through Black Bart\'s Cave right away \'cause, we\'re gonna wanna do it seven or eight times. And then we\'ll watch the cliff divers before the puppet show.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, it\'s Kyle\'s birthday. We should do whatever he wants to do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What? Fuck Kyle. \'\'[the others look at him in astonishment]\'\' Ha ha, j-just kidding, birthday joke. Of course we\'ll do whatever Kyle wants, uh. Happy Birthday, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'Happy Birthday to you. Happy- [looks at the other boys for support]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan, Cartman, Kenny|\'\'Birthday to you. Happy Birthday dear Kyle. Happy Birthday to you. [they pass a missing person\'s billboard with Butters on it and South Park PD\'s phone number]\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Park County Trash Dump, day. A worker drives into the dump in her truck and pulls out stuffed trash bags from the truck bed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[off-screen] You take away the biggest part of me. [the worker listens, then goes to the source of the sound] Woo-oo-ooooo-oo-oo, uh baby please don\'t go.

Are you infected?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Worker|With what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|You\'re not a cannibal, are you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Worker|No?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh. \'\'[drops the broom and smiles]\'\' Oh good. You\'re a survivor, like me. Look, Mr. Dog, another survivor. And it\'s a lady, too. That means we \'\'can\'\' repopulate the earth. Yippee!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Worker|Kid, what are you doin\' here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I\'m rebuilding society. Here, take a look. \'\'[moves off to his left, she follows. They pass a row of makeshift buildings that he built overnight]\'\' This is the library, and over here is the bank. That over there I\'m thinking into a P.F. Chang\'s or a Bennigan\'s. And this \'\'[a statue that reads Cartman under it]\'\' is a memorial to Eric Cartman, the person who gave his life so that I could rebuild society. Well ma\'am, I guess we should start repopulatin\' the earth, huh? \'\'[promptly unzips and drops his pants, then steps forward.]\'\' I\'m ready whenever you are.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Worker|Kid, I don\'t know what you think is going on, but this place is a dump.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey, that\'s not very nice! This is my first society! I\'m doin\' my best!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Worker|No, I mean you\'re at the garbage dump. The town is right over there, everybody is fine, and I think they\'ve been looking for you for over a week.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[looks at her for a long time, then looks towards the town]\'\' Oh... \'\'[realizes he\'s been tricked, he looks down and pulls up his pants.]\'\' Ma\'am, can I use your phone?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Casa Bonita, night. Sheila pulls into a parking space.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We\'re here! We\'re here! Casa Bonita! \'\'[the boys climb out of the car]\'\' Aw man, this is gonna be so great!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Wait up, Eric. We need to stay together. \'\'[Cartman stops and dances in place. A phone rings]\'\' Uh, hold on boys, that\'s my cell phone. \'\'[fishes it out of her purse and answers it]\'\' Hello? Yes. Oh, that\'s great! \'\'[to her charges]\'\' Boys, they found Butters. \'\'[Cartman stops dancing and his grin turns into panic]\'\' He\'s okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, awesome.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I knew he\'d turn up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Yes, Eric Cartman is with us. Why? \'\'[her face turns stern]\'\' Oh really? \'\'[Cartman looks around for a way to escape]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Yes, I will certainly let him know. Thank you. \'\'[hangs up and puts the phone away]\'\' Well, it appears that Eric here is responsible for Butters missing, because \'\'he\'\' wanted to go to Casa Bonita. \'\'[the anger now registers on the other boys\' faces]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Eric, the South Park Police are already on their way here to have a little talk with you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But...

Eh. Nuh! \'\'[throws him away and dashes for the entrance]\'\' Less than a minute! Less than a minute!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[rises and turns around]\'\' Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Casa Bonita, inside.

That was cool, huh? \'\'[looks towards the entrance and sees the rest of his party and the police enter the restaurant]\'\' Whoa. \'\'[dashes for the jail set at the Photo Flash Back.
