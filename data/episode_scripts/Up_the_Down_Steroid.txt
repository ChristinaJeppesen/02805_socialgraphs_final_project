What\'d I do?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Denver Athletic Club, Denver, day. Inside, the athletes are working out on a variety of equipment. Jimmy and Timmy are at a bench press.

I\'m gonna be rich!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, I was just looking at the Special Olympics brochure, and check this shit out: "At the end of the Special Olympics, a Grand Champion Special Athlete is crowned and given a cash prize of $1000" \'\'[he looks at his friends as his jaw drops]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So?! So, dude, think about it. If somebody just \'\'pretended\'\' to be mentally handicapped, they could easily win the competition and get the thousand bucks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh no. Cartman, no!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s flawless! I\'ll act like I have a disability, and when the time come to compete I\'ll kick ass against all the handicaps!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That\'s really, \'\'really\'\' terrible, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Terrible?? Whatever! You guys\' brains just can\'t compute complex plans like mine can! It\'ll work, you\'ll see. \'\'[walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[moves and catches up to Cartman]\'\' Cartman!

Grow up, Kyle! \'\'[turns around and walks off. Kyle seethes in silence. Cartman now talks to himself]\'\' All I have to do is make people think I\'m handicapped, and I get a thousand dollars. It won\'t be easy, but nothing worth having ever is.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A montage, to the tune of "Scarface (Put It To The Limit)" Cartman sits at his computer typing away. Onscreen are his plans for looking handicapped, "Ways to Appear Handicapped." He\'s then at the library poring over piles of books. The librarian wheels a cartload of books over, Cartman points to the spot at which they should be dropped off, and the librarian obliges. Cartman then rides to school in the Special Ed bus, taking notes on the behavior of handicapped students. Next, he\'s in the bathroom at home contorting his face this way and that, then takes more notes. He leafs through another book and types in more notes into his computer, then pours himself some more coffee.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman goes to a clothing store looking for ill-fitting clothes. He then cobbles a custom shoe for himself. He goes home and tries it out. He goes to a CGI studio and puts on a motion suit so he can make a 3D model of himself on a computer. He takes the 3D model home and modifies it on his own computer: "Handicapped Walk Analysis." He then goes into the bathroom and cuts off clumps of his hair to look as if he were retarded. He goes to the living room and looks at a Kid Rock video for more inspiration and takes notes. He puts on a bicycle helmet and pulls his hair out through the holes. He assembles the various parts of his handicapped outfit and puts it on. He squishes his face upwards for the finishing touch and ties the helmet straps together well below his chin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Daaaarrrr. Duuuuurrrr. I wanna be in the Special Olympics. \'\'[loosens the chin straps and lowers his face to normal]\'\' Bull\'s eye!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimmy\'s house, bedroom, night. Jimmy is at his bed. He straps on a strip of heavy rubberband, dabs his arm a few times with alcohol, jabs the syringe into his arm and injects some liquid steroids into his arm. He loosens the rubber band and someone knocks on his door. He looks around and jumps off his bead.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Oh! Agh! Ju-just a second! \'\'[heads for his duffel bag and hauls it to his night stand. The knock is heard again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Jimmy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[sweeps the steroids into the bag]\'\' Hang on, I\'m-I\'m, coming. \'\'[rushes to the closet and shoves the duffle bag in.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|Jim, it\'s your father!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[walking towards the door]\'\' I said I\'m coming! Give me a Goddamned s-second! \'\'[gasps and realizes he still has the syringe in his mouth and spits it out.

Well, you have a visitor. \'\'[the camera pans down to a pretty girl, who enters the room]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girl|Hi Jimmy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Oh. Hi, N-N-Nancy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nancy|I was hoping we would study for the spelling test tomorrow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Oh. Sure thing.

We\'ve been going out since we met in Free Period last week.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ryan|I\'ll leave you two alone. \'\'[reaches for the door, but stops]\'\' Y-You sure you weren\'t masturbating, Jim?

Drrrrr.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[low voice]\'\' God damn you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You see, gentlemen?

If you\'re under eighteen, you have to have a \'\'parent\'\' with you to sign up for the Special Olympics.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?! \'\'[takes the brochure back from Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It says \'\'right there\'\' "a parent has to be with you to sign up," and you\'ll never get your mom to agree to something so horrible, so ha! \'\'[grins confidently. Cartman looks at him, then at the brochure and reads]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, later. Liane is at the kitchen table paying bills. Cartman walks in from the dining room. He puts his arms behind his back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Moooommmm?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Yes, hon? \'\'[begins writing a check]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Um, could I get you to do something for me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|What\'s that, hon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Um, okay.

Here\'s .. the truth. \'\'[under his breath]\'\' God, this is gonna be hard to say. \'\'[normally]\'\' I think, Mom, that I\'ve been hard on some of the handicapped kids at school in the past. I\'ve sometimes looked at people with disabilities as people God put here on earth for my amusement, but... now I\'m starting to think... that if I could just spend one day in their shoes... if I could just see the challenges they face every day... maybe I wouldn\'t be so cold. I just want a chance to change. \'\'[looks up at her with longing, puppy dog eyes.]\'\' Help me change?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh, a- a- all right, sweetie, I- I\'ll take you tomorrow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Awesome.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Denver Athletic Club, day.

Jimmy increases his lead over the competition.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Track and Field events, javelin throw. An athlete runs up to the edge and throws his javelin. His tongue hangs out. Timmy rolls up and throws his javelin. Cartman runs up and throws his, but it lands just far enough for him to still touch the tail end of it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|God-damnit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Track and Field events, triple jump. Jimmy jumps and lands at 18.5 feet, skids a foot more, then stops and waits for the score.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|That\'s another Special Olympics record!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[raises his arms and crutches up in victory]\'\' Yeah! Yeah! \'\'[turns around]\'\' Yeah, I did it! \'\'[turns around]\'\' Yeah! Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Early evening at the Special Olympics stadium. The sun has set and some of the crowd is back on the field.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|Ladies and Gentlemen, our day of competition has come to an end, and we have an ultimate grand special champion for 2004! Here to present the award are baseball legends Mark McGuire, Jason Giambi, and Barry Bonds. \'\'[the three players come out and walk to the podium. All of them are buff]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bonds|The 2004 special athlete is... Jimmy Valmer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[raises up his left arm and crutch]\'\' Yeah! Fuck yeah! \'\'[Timmy sits nearby with his arms crossed, glaring at Jimmy. Jimmy walks up to the podium]\'\' Yeah, I did it! I\'m the b-bub-best! \'\'[Bonds hands Jimmy the medal. The host returns to the podium]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|Congratulations, Jimmy. But we all know that the Special Olympics isn\'t just about winning. And so, we will now give out the Spirit Award, to the handicapped person who came in very last. Eric Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ah, screw you hippies!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|For winning the Spirit Award, Eric will receive this gift certificate to Shakey\'s for fifty dollars! Come on up, Eric!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...I could pile at Shakey\'s, heck. \'\'[puts on his helmet and walks up]\'\' Uh, Drrrr! Drrrr!}} \n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[confronts Cartman]\'\' Hey! Just what the hell do you think you\'re doing, Eric?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[humbly]\'\' Uhh, hehe. Uh de-duhhhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|You f-f f-faked being handicapped to win?! \'\'[grabs Cartman by the collar]\'\' I should kick your ass right here, you lousy no-good ch-ch-cheater!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Timmy|\'\'[approaches]\'\' Timmah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Timmy|\'\'[points to Jimmy]\'\' Timmah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[thinks a moment]\'\' Oh my God. You-you\'re right, Timmy. You\'re totally right. \'\'[walks up to the mic and begins talking]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Everyone, can I have your attention, please? \'\'[everyone falls silent]\'\' I\'m afraid I have to give back my medal. The truth is, I haven\'t been playing fair either. I\'ve been using st-steroids. I was willing to do anything to be the best, and the steroids made me blind to the people I was hurting. \'\'[a shot of Nancy, injured and taped around the head. She smiles]\'\' A good friend even tried to talk me out of it, and I wouldn\'t listen to him. \'\'[a shot of Timmy, who smiles and shows off his silver medal. Others around him wear bronzes.]\'\' Taking steroids is just like pretending to be handicapped at the Special Olympics. \'\'[a shot of a chastened Cartman before the baseball players]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy| Because you\'re taking all the fairness out of the game. But I know now that even if you do win on steroids, you\'re really not a winner. You\'re just a p-pussy. You\'re just a \'\'[shot of Mark McGuire]\'\' big fat p-p-pussy, and if you take steroids, the only decent thing to do is come forward and say, \'\'[shot of Barry Bonds]\'\' "Remove me from the record books, because I am a big, stinky p-pussy- " \'\'[shot of Jason Giambi]\'\' "-steroid-taking jackass." \'\'[Giambi nods ever so subtly]\'\' That\'s how I feel about myself, and why I must decline this medal and my place in the history books. And if you\'ll let me, I\'ll be back next year. To compete with honor. \'\'[applause rises from the stands, followed by cheers. The volunteers and baseball players gather around Jimmy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|McGuire|Hey kid. Good for you for being honest.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The stands. Cartman walks up to his friends.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well guys, I guess now you see what I was up to all along. I dressed up like a handicapped person and lost the Special Olympics on purpose, so that Jimmy could learn his lesson about steroids. \'\'[he looks at Kyle and then Stan for a reaction, but neither offers any. He frowns, then steps forward angrily]\'\' Eh, oh yeah?! We- well you guys are assholes! \'\'[straightens up]\'\' Grow up! \'\'[walks off in a huff]\'\'}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia08|episode=03}}\n[[zh:吐出类固醇/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Eight]]'}]}}}}
