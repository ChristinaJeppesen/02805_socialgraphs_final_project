Do you think I\'m unhappy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steven|Wait, the.. the \'\'point\'\' is... that you \'\'can\'\' be happy.

We\'d like to share our interest in David Blaine with you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Elderly woman|Uh oh. My husband warned me about you Blainiacs. I\'m sorry, but I\'m a Catholic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh it... doesn\'t matter, ma\'am. Blaintology is for everyone. There are Blaintologists who are Catholics, Buddhists - why even Kyle here is a Goddamn Jew.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Elderly woman|So you\'re not a cult?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[giggles]\'\' Of course, no. David Blaine is a real person. You may have seen his television specials on ABC.

Facing them on the opposite corner is Stan, standing by his bike]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Come, Brother Kyle, we have no time for him. \'\'[turns right and walks down the street. Kyle looks back at Stan for a few seconds, then follows Cartman. Stan turns and walks down the street in the same direction Kyle and Cartman were walking, but stops when a car appears in front of him. He sees some adult Blaintologists inside. The driver starts the car and moves towards Stan, who turns about face and begins to run with his bike. The car looms behind him and he lets go of his bike.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|HaaAAAA! \'\'[the car totals the bike, bumps Stan onto the sidewalk, and peels away.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Driver|You\'d better watch yourself next time, abandoner! \'\'[Stan looks at the car, scared.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus\' house, next day.

Come in.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus\' house, living room. A pitcher of water sits on the coffee table}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This guy is going around doing magic tricks and saying they\'re miracles! My friend Kyle thinks he\'s totally awesome!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|You\'re good to bring this to my attention, Stan. Cults are a very dangerous thing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I read in the Bible that you did miracles, too. If you could go in front of these people and do your miracles, then, they\'ll all see that David Blaine isn\'t so special.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|The miracle I\'m most famous for is turning water into wine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Can you do it again?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Very well. I shall perform the miracle. Behold. Here you can see ordinary water, clear, clean. Okay now, turn around. \'\'[Stan looks at Jesus quizzically.

That\'s how you did that trick?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Wuh well, yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That trick sucks, Jesus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Oh. Well, I guess it worked a little better on people 2000 years ago.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, we have to do something. This guy is performing more miracles in Denver tonight. He\'s gonna get more followers, and it\'ll be impossible for me to get Kyle out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Then let\'s go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But dude, I\'d I don\'t think you should do that lame water-to-wine trick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Oh,don\'t worry \'\'[rises and joins Stan out the door]\'\' I have a few more miracles up my sleeve.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Denver, night. An arena is shown, and the place is packed.

A few moments later the crowd roars with approval]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, no way! \'\'[two female Blaintology assistants rush up and help Blaine stand. One has a little cage, another has a small curtain and rod. The one to his right places the cage where the head would be, while the one on the left places the curtain in front. A few seconds later, Blaine\'s head is back on his shoulders. The audience cheers]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Blaine|Thank you, everyone. \'\'[the audience quiets down]\'\' Our organization grows larger every day.

Certainly not enough to feed this entire crowd, but now - turn around \'\'[the crowd stares back blankly]\'\' Ya need tuh- turn around. \'\'[Stan slaps his hand to his forehead, but the crowd turns around.

Then what\'s this \'\'[reaches behind Blaine\'s ear and pulls out a card]\'\' Ace of Spades doing behind your ear?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|Whoa. \'\'[some chatter. Blaine then levitates, goes into a spin and disappears into a deck of cards, which then splits in two. Each half traces a circle and then both halves combine to make a larger circle.
