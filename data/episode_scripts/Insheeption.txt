\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. The students are all in the cafeteria eating lunch. In the middle of the cafeteria is a table with the four boys there. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sit opposite Clyde, Craig, Kevin, and Tolkien.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So then, the guy hits the ping-pong ball with his dick, and it goes right in the other guy\'s mouth. \'\'[laughs heartily.

It\'s a real disease. It\'s called "hoarding." People who can\'t throw anything away, and they just keep living in deeper and deeper filth until the people around them just can\'t take it anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[approaching]\'\' Is something wrong, Wendy? \'\'[Wendy sees him, then looks at the girls, gets up and walks up to Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[sighs]\'\' Stan? We need to talk about your locker.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|My locker?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[turns away]\'\' Every time I see the condition it\'s in I j-I just wanna cry. It just keeps getting messier and messier. I think you have a problem.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Are you serious?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[turns back]\'\' It\'s so full of junk it takes you forever to find anything. And lately you\'ve been asking to keep things in my locker.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, it\'s just a little messy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|No, Stan, it\'s called "hoarding"! And if you don\'t get help, I don\'t know how much longer I could be with you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Aw, come on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Then can we throw some stuff in your locker away?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, alright.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[wipes a tear from her eye]\'\' Okay. \'\'[puts a hand on his shoulder]\'\' I\'ve hired some experts to help you with this.

One of them holds a large trash bag and is wearing a face mask}}\n{{ScriptDialog|An Expert|Hello everyone, my name is Dr. Chinstrap. I\'m a hoarding specialist, and today we\'re gonna help Stan clean out his locker. Alright, let\'s go ahead and see inside your locker, Stan. \'\'[Stan goes to his locker, opens it, and a few items fall out. The class gasps in horror: Stan\'s locker is truly packed. Wendy cries and hides her face with her notebook]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What, come on, it\'s not that bad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Now, as part of Stan\'s therapy, we need to make sure we don\'t throw away anything he doesn\'t want us to. Stan needs to feel like he is in control or his psychosis will come out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|My psychosis? Look, it isn\'t that big a deal, I\'ll just throw this stuff away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|\'\'[walks up to Stan and gets down on one knee]\'\' Okay, great. How about we start with this? \'\'[takes a small box out of the locker]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, no, that\'s my pencil box. I need my pencil box.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|\'\'[defers right away, putting a hand up]\'\' Okay, okay, we\'ll put that right here on the floor. Now how about this? \'\'[takes out a bent toothbrush]\'\' Broken toothbrush.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well... it\'s good to have that, because sometimes I really wanna brush after lunch, and I-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|But it\'s broken.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, but it works perfectly fine and I-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|\'\'[defers right away]\'\' Okay, okay. Broken toothbrush is going right here, by the pencil box. \'\'[sets it down]\'\' Now how about this? \'\'[pulls out a clear sandwich bag with rotten food in it]\'\' Old sandwich in a baggie filled with maggots.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Class|Eeeeewwww! \'\'[two more men stand behind the class holding trash bags and wearing face masks]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, that, I mean, yeah, I mean... I kinda need that. Let\'s, let\'s just keep that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|It\'s full of maggots, Stan. Can we throw it away?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I might need it if I every have to, you know, like-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|The maggots are crawling down my hand and biting my wrist, Stan. Can we throw this away?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I- I guess so, but- \'\'[Dr. Chinstrap dumps the baggie into the large trash bag his assistant is holding. The assistant is wearing a facemask]\'\' Whoa-whoa-wait, this is all happening a little fast. Can we just slow down? \'\'[Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny look at each other worriedly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Now how about this empty aspirin bottle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well no, don\'t throw that out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Can we throw out these wadded up papers, then? \'\'[sweeps out a bunch of loose papers. Stan gets alarmed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[begins gathering up the papers]\'\' No, because there could be something written on one of them that\'s important and uh-! No, don\'t take my empty bottle-! \'\'[takes the bottle from Dr. Chinstrap. The assistant pulls out the baggie]\'\' G-give me back my sandwich! \'\'[Stan grabs the baggie, then reaches for another loose sheet, when he realizes what he\'s done.

What\'s wrong with you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t... I don\'t know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Maybe you should go talk to the counselor.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Mackey\'s office, later. Stan is in his office}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Stan, as your counselor, I\'m here to help you with whatever problems you might have, m\'kay? Now, what is the matter? \'\'[before Stan answers, he looks around the office. Mr. Mackey has a lot of junk in there]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, my friends are worried that I\'m showing signs of... "hoarding."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Hoarding? M\'kay, what\'s that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, apparently, it\'s when you... don\'t throw anything away and soon you find yourself, living with a, bunch of... junk?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Hmmm, I haven\'t heard of that, but it- it definitely sounds bad, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[looks around again]\'\' Mr. Mackey, is there, maybe anything you wanna talk about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Me? ...Like, like what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[looks around and picks up an empty milk carton from a box]\'\' Well like, you\'ve got an old milk carton here from a month ago that\'s like-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|DON\'T YOU TOUCH THAT! THAT\'S NOT SOMETHING TO THROW AWAY! IF YOU THROW THAT AWAY I WILL RAPE YOU IN THE MOUTH! M\'KAY?! I WILL RAPE YOU IN YOUR FUCKING MOUTH! M\'KAY?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary faculty room. Randy and Sharon are there with Mr. Garrison, Principal Victoria, Dr. Chinstrap, and another expert}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|There\'s no doubt about it. The school counselor here is a Class-5 hoarder. As for your son, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh, he\'s easily a Class-3.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|But why is Mr. Mackey doing this now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Yes, our son has always been fairly clean.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|We don\'t know a lot about what causes hoarding, but we do know it often relates to some kind of psychological trauma. If it\'s okay with you, we\'d like to run some tests on the both of them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Is that really necessary for Stan? It\'s just his locker.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|I don\'t know if you realize how serious locker hoarding is. \'\'[turns away]\'\' It can lead to room hoarding, then house hoarding. In some cases, people even hoard animals, like cats.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh yeah. Like that weird guy over on on Burgess Road. That guy, Mr. Yelman. He\'s been hoarding animals for years now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Oh no, really?}}\n{{ScriptScene|A pasture, day. Dr. Chinstrap and his partner are present with Sgt. Yates and an officer}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sgt. Yates|Mr. Yelman, we received some disturbing reports that you might be hoarding sheep.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|\'\'[a shepherd, or sheep herder, or sheep hoarder]\'\' ...Well I, that is I, I-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|It\'s okay, Mr. Yelman, I\'m a hoarding specialist. What you have is an illness. \'\'[Mr. Yelman doesn\'t know what they\'re talking about]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|A lab, later. Stan, Mr. Mackey, and Mr. Yelman are all on couches with electrodes attached to their temples. Dr. Chinstrap is running tests as his partner and Stan\'s parents watch from an observation room}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Partner|Don\'t worry, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. Dr. Chinstrap is a professional at memory regression. This should prove very helpful.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Alright everyone, we are all here to face the disease of hoarding together. Nothing to be ashamed of, everyone here has the same problem. Whether it\'s office hoarding, or in the locker, or even the hoarding of animals.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|Excuse me, but uh, I am a sheep herder.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|It\'s pronounced "hoarder," and yes you are.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|But but I, uh I\'m actually herding sheep.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Yes, you are hurting sheep by hoarding them, aren\'t you? It\'s good you realize that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|No, but I just thought that-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Now listen: there\'s a psychological reason you\'re all doing this, and we\'re gonna get to the bottom of it. We\'re gonna do some regression therapy. I\'ll be taking you deep into your memories, into your past.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|M\'kay, that that sounds like it could be bad, uh-kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Trust me, I know what I\'m doing. I want the three of you to relax, and think about... a cloud. A lone cloud... floating... changing... light... cool air... blowing on the cloud. float- \'\'[jumps out of his chair suddenly, startling the subjects]\'\' WAAH! HAAA! HAAA!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|What?! What?! Jesus, what?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|Oh my God!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Sorry, I just got a weird gas bubble for a second. \'\'[clears his throat]\'\' Anyway, A lone cloud... floating... wisps of cool air... now the cloud is near you, you... you reach out to it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[stretches his arm out]\'\' Mmm-kay...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|It\'s the cloud of your memories, of your past, \'\'[focus on Mr. Mackey]\'\' ...your childhood perhaps, ...what do you see in the cloud? Who is in the cloud?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Billy, ...Billy Thompson?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mackey\'s memory takes him back to the 1970s, when he was in grammar school. Three kids angrily walk towards him in the hall.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Billy|There he is! Hey, Mackey! \'\'[Mr. Mackey, talking to two other boys, suddenly drops his books and turns around]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Oh uh, hi Billy. Nice to see ya, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Billy|Come \'ere! \'\'[points to the spot where he wants Mackey. Mackey\'s friends panic and split]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Uh well, actually I need to get home, m\'kay? I uh...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Billy|You snitched and told the principal I was smoking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Oh well uh, uh... smoking\'s bad, uhkay? \'\'[Billy throws him up against a locker]\'\' Huhhhhh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Billy|You\'re gonna die Mackey! \'\'[to his friends]\'\' Hold his legs! \'\'[his friends move in, but Mackey gets loose and runs away, screaming. Mackey rounds a corner, finds a room, and goes in before Billy could catch him. Billy and his friends round the corner and run past the room Mackey entered]\'\' Come back here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|\'\'[in the darkness, starts to calm down]\'\' Okay. Okay, okay okay, it\'s okay. It\'s okay. Calm down, okay. Turn on the light. \'\'[turns on the light, revealing Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What? Whoa wait, what am I doing here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Shh. Be quiet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|\'Scuse me, where are we?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Shh. You\'ve gotta be quiet. Billy Thompson\'s out there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What the hell\'s going on?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|In the observation room Dr. Chinstrap and his partner analyze some printouts}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|What the hell is going on?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Partner|The counselor\'s flat top readers are calculating with the boy\'s and the sheep hoarder\'s.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|Oh Jesus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What does that mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|It means Mr. Mackey\'s childhood regression dream is... so vivid it actually sucked the other two patients into it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Partner|I\'m afraid your son has gone into his counselor\'s dream.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Aw come on, that\'s stupid. How\'s that, how\'s that even possible?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Chinstrap|It\'s not stupid at all! Pinkerton, you explain the logic and I\'ll provide the background.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pinkerton|Alright. \'\'[walks up to Randy and Sharon]\'\' Look, it is possible to enter into someone else\'s dreams. \'\'[Dr. Chinstrap begins a musical accompaniment]\'\' Send dream trackers to go into a person\'s subconscious, like a spy seeing their dreams as they see them. Perhaps even planting ideas. If one person is regressing deeply enough, the dream can actually envelop those dreaming around the first person I talked about who\'s dreaming! And then, everyone in the dream would be in danger of never coming back. \'\'[Dr. Chinstrap ends his accompaniment at the same time]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mackey\'s dream.

Yep, this is my happy place, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mr. Mackey.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|\'\'[sees his Lite Brite, runs to work on it, and sings]\'\' Lite Brite, making things with light. What a sight, making things with Lite Brite, m\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mr. Mackey, what are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Well this is a Lite Brite, m\'kay. I can make things with light, like um, birds, m\'kay, clowns, m\'kay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, dude, you\'ve gotta wake up!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Oh yeah, my Evel Knievel doll! \'\'[goes to his dresser and grabs it]\'\' I can take the motorcycle, hm\'kay, I put it on this thing, like this. \'\'[puts the motorcycle on the little ramp]\'\' Okay now crank it back, and now I let go. \'\'[releases the motorcycle, which zooms across the room and does a wheelie. Mackey giggles with excitement]\'\' Okay. Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mr. Mackey, I realize this might be fun for you, but it totally isn\'t for me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Hey, look what\'s on! It\'s ZOOM!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Yelman|Excuse me, I really need to get back to my sheep.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m working on it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|\'\'[Singing along with the TV]\'\' Write Zoom Z Double O M Box 350 Bos-ton Mass.
