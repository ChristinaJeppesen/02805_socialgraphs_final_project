We\'re Mormons now and we\'re having Family Home Evening!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, did you know that that Joseph Smith guy read the Book of Mormon out of a hat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|And? \'\'[to Sharon]\'\' Your turn, Sharon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s just that... the Book of Mormon says a lot of strange stuff, like that Adam and Eve lived in Jackson County, Missouri.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But school taught me that the first man and woman lived in Africa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well you can\'t believe everything school tells you, Stan. Your turn, Shelly. \'\'[the doorbell rings]\'\' Oooo, that must be the Harrisons! \'\'[rises and goes to the front door. He opens and the Harrisons walk in with enthusiasm, chatting away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|Hey everybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mark|\'\'[walks around]\'\' Wow, what a great house!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Karen|\'\'[walks up to Sharon]\'\' You must be Mrs. Marsh; it\'s so nice to meet you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jenny|\'\'[walks up to Shelly]\'\' And you must be Stan\'s sister. Oh, I think your brother\'s the greatest.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|My brother is a stupid turd.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|\'\'[walks up to Stan]\'\' Hey Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[with reservations]\'\' Hey Gary.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, come on in and sit down, everybody. \'\'[they all settle in on the couches in the living room. Shelly avoids looking at the Harrisons]\'\' You\'re here just in time. My son was having a little problem with our new religion.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|Ohohoho, really? Well, that\'s just because he hasn\'t heard the \'\'best part\'\' about the Joseph Smith story! The one that proves he was for real!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Harrisons|Yeah! Woohoo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ooo, what\'s that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|Well, you remember Martin Harris, the rich man who wrote down what Joseph Smith read out of the hat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|See, after he was done, he took some of the pages of what would become the Book of Mormon home.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back to the 1800s, night, the large building.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singers|<poem><i>Martin went home to his wife\nDumb dumb dumb dumb dumb\nAnd showed her pages from the Book of Mormon\nDumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|A-and so Joseph Smith put his head into a hat, a-and read to me what the golden plates said. I wrote it all down and we\'re gonna publish it into a book.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Harris|Martin, how do you know he isn\'t just making stuff up and pretending he\'s translating off golden plates?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singers|<poem><i>Lucy Harris smart smart smart\nSmart smart smart smart smart</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|Why would he make it up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singers|\'\'Martin Harris dumb dadumb-\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lucy|All right, here. I\'m gonna hide these pages. \'\'[puts them in a drawer at the bottom end of an armoir]\'\' If Joseph Smith really is translating off of golden plates, then he\'ll be able to do it again. But if Joseph Smith is making it all up, then the new translations will be different from these.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|Okay, fine. I bet he\'ll have no problem. \'\'[puts on his coat and heads out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singers|<poem><i>Lucy Harris smart smart smart\nMartin Harris dumb.\nSo Martin went on back to Smith\nSaid the pages had gone away\nSmith got mad and told Martin\nHe needed to go pray\nDumb dumb dumb dumb dumb</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|\'\'[upon Smith\'s return]\'\' Look, ah I\'m sorry about losin\' the pages we worked on, Joe, but I\'m ready to write it all down again if you translate from the plates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Smith|I would love to, Martin, except, I just had a vision. And the Lord said he\'s very angry with me for letting you take those pages.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|\'\'[gasps]\'\' He is??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singers|\'\'Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Smith|Yes. He is so mad that he will never let me translate from the plate of Lehi again. He\'s... we must now translate from the plate of Nephi. So it will be the same basic story, but written a little differently.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|Wow! If God got angry with you, then you \'\'must\'\' be tellin\' the truth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singers|\'\'Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb.\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harris|All right, Martin. Let\'s get to work! \'\'[Smith reads from the hat again and dictates to Harris, who writes it all down]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back to the present, the Marsh house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|And that\'s how it happened.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Yeah! All right! \'\'[the Marshes sit there without a word to say]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...Wait. Mormons actually know this story and they still believe Joseph Smith was a prophet?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|Well sure. The story proves it, doesn\'t it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, it proves he DID make it all up. Are you blind?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mark|Well, Stan, it\'s all a matter of faith.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, it\'s a matter of logic! If you\'re gonna say things that have been proven wrong, like that the first man and woman lived in Missouri, and that Native Americans came from Jerusalem, then you\'d better have something to back it up. All you\'ve got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat, and then couldn\'t do it again when the translations were hidden!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hey, Stan, don\'t denounce our religion.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[crosses his arms]\'\' I don\'t wanna be Mormon, Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Me neither.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|Hey, that\'s only cool, guys. You can believe whatever you want!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|Yeah, it\'s great you have your own beliefs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|Yeah! Hooray for the Marshes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, stop it! \'\'[stands up]\'\' That\'s another thing! Why do you have to be so freakin\' nice all the time?! It isn\'t normal! You just weasel people into your way of thinking by acting like the happiest family in the world and being so nice to everyone that you just blindside dumb people like my Dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah! \'\'[moments later they are standing outside, and the door is slammed on their faces. They turn around, and Gary Sr. sighs]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary Sr.|Well kids... Who\'s up for a water balloon fight?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Yeah! All right! \'\'[they leave the Marsh house in high spirits, except Gary, who looks insulted]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bus stop, next day. Kyle, Cartman and Kenny wait for the bus, Stan walks up somewhat somberly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, hey Stan. Where\'s your best buddy, Gary?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m not hanging around that kid anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[needling]\'\' Oh no! You guys broke up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You guys were right, okay? The new kid\'s a douche. Now I just gotta find a way to keep him away from me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|\'\'[shows up]\'\' Hey Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh brother.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh oh, the jilted lover returns.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|Listen, I just wanted to let you know you don\'t have to worry about me tryin\' to be your friend anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gary|Look, maybe us Mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe Joseph Smith did make it all up, but I have a great life. and a great family, and I have the Book of Mormon to thank for that. The truth is, I don\'t care if Joseph Smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. And even though people in \'\'this\'\' town might think that\'s stupid, I still choose to believe in it. All I ever did was try to be your friend, Stan, but you\'re so high and mighty you couldn\'t look past my religion and just be my friend back. You\'ve got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. Suck my balls. \'\'[turns around and walks off. All four boys just look at him in wonder.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Damn, that kid is cool, huh?}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia07|episode=12}}\n[[ja:All About Mormons/台本]]\n[[zh:摩门教家庭/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Seven]]'}]}}}}
