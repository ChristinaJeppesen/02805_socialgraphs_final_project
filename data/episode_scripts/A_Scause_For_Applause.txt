Okay, if Jesus rose from the dead with the help of drugs, that\'s fine, but then he went on to say it was a miracle, and that is where it became dangerous! What about the Incas?! What about the Aztecs?! Millions of people who were murdered in Jesus\'s name, and then Jesus turns out to be a fraud!

I\'ve talked to the government here and I\'ve talked to the farmers, and I think we have everything just about worked out. \'\'[a tank unleashes a bomb and a bunch of farmers are killed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Farmers|AAAAH!! \'\'[the tanks open fire with machine guns; more farmers are killed, until the last one falls]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|You know, whatever stupid rumors people wanna believe about me, it doesn\'t change the fact that the people of Belarus need my help.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field reporter|Ah I believe it\'s Belarus, Jesus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Yes, it very well may be if we don\'t do something now. \'\'[the tanks and bulldozers move forward to crush the corpses of the farmers]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field reporter|Um, so you think you\'ve something here to keep the conflict from escalating, is that right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|I\'m just doing what I\'ve always done. People wanna know what I\'m on. What am I on? I\'m on a farm in Belarus busting my ass! What are you on?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field reporter|Uh huh, and now that the Belarusian farmers are all dead, what will you try next?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|What? \'\'[turns around]\'\' Aw, shit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, day. P.F. Pityef is in town and has set up a makeshift Scauses stand on an empty lot between two other buildings. A small crowd is in front of the stand. In the crowd are Cartman, Butters, Craig, and Mr. Mackey}}\n{{ScriptDialog|P.F. Pityef|One at a time, please. One at a time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Look, I want to return this orange bracelet, m\'kay?! \'\'[it looks like everyone else does too.]\'\' It\'s worthless now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|P.F. Pityef|Not a problem, you can return your scause and for just five dollars I\'ll give you two more!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[steps up]\'\' Okay, I need a violet one for domestic violence, a lime one for herpes, and a jade green one for how much I hate Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|P.F. Pityef|Absolutely! Five dollars please.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan stands across the street from the stand, and Kyle walks up to him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Heidi Turner said you asked her to borrow superglue last week.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[glares at Kyle]\'\' Are you still on that dude?! Have you ever heard of ends justifying means?! \'\'[a bouncy noise is heard]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|P.F. Pityef|Oh my, it\'s the sound!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wu-what sound?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|P.F. Pityef|Of all sounds in all sounddom this one\'s most profound. \'\'[puts his ear against a funnel in which a penny circles round]\'\' That\'s the sound that means I must pack up my tent. It\'s the sound of the last cent being spent. \'\'[quickly goes to a control panel and starts pressing buttons, and his stand collapses into a truck. He gets in and drives off]\'\' My work here is done, and just look at you now! You\'re all covered in scauses from your hoof to your brow. Enjoy all your scauses. You look great in your cause. Be sure to give each other lots of applause. I\'m off to the next town in my little truck. Have a nice day! Toot a loo!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...Fuck! Dude, weak. \'\'[the town is covered in scauses and looks like a Dr. Seuss town]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house. Jesus and Stan sit on the sofa looking dejected}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s almost like... like, that guy had this figured out all along.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Yeah...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We were trying to do good. But we got everyone duped by a bracelet company.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Yeah, well, I guess we\'re just gonna have to accept that people aren\'t gonna think very highly of us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well... we can\'t just let that guy get away with taking everyone\'s money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|What can we possibly do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[after a long while]\'\' What would Jesus do? \'\'[Rocky fanfare plays and Jesus slowly gets energized. He gets off the sofa and walks to the dining room table, reaches into his robe and pulls out a big bottle of HGH. He plants it on the table and opens it. He pours some into the cap and drinks it. He transforms into a superhuman and flips the dining room table over. He turns and breaks through the front wall, obliterating the front door, and runs off to find the charlatan. Stan looks on]\'\' Yeheah! \'\'[Jesus goes to the Scauses factory and flips over every truck he finds in his way, then bursts into the factory. He beats up all the workers there]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Vengeance is mine! \'\'[he destroys the assembly line]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|P.F. Pityef|No please! Please show mercy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Get out! \'\'[picks him up and shoves him into a grinder. P.F. Pityef is ground up, but his remains clog up the grinder and raise the pressure throughout the factory. Soon the factory blows up. Everyone in town has shown up to see this and burst into applause. Later, Jesus is back to normal and on a small hill - a mount - and speaks to the crowd]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Thank you my children. \'\'[the crowd quiets down]\'\' We\'ve all been through a lot. We got caught up in scauses... that didn\'t mean squat. They turned my message away from the teachings it hid, and made it about me and the things that I did. Which of course I didn\'t do. And even if I did use performance-enhancing drugs, so did all the other prophets. But I didn\'t. So what have we learned from this great wristband theft? Maybe, that when stripped of our scauses, only causes are left. And causes shouldn\'t be worn on our wrists with a sneer. Let\'s keep our causes where they belong, which is \'\'[places his hands over his heart]\'\' right here. On T-shirts! \'\'[opens his robe enough to show his cause]\'\' Free Pussy Riot! \'\'[the crowd begins to clap and cheer]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Free Pussy Riot!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The boys|\'\'[look at each other and then]\'\' Yeah!}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia16|episode=13}}\n[[zh:信念危机/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Sixteen]]'}]}}}}
