In Phase 2 we do Coon vs. Fastpass followed by an origin movie about Mosquito.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Bzzz oh boy, I get my own origin movie, bzzz?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s right.

How so?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Well, look, we all know there\'s a lot of mixing of truth and fiction that\'s been on Facebook lately, and children lack the cognitive ability to determine what\'s true and what isn\'t on Facebook. That\'s why we now have young kids dressing up in costumes, eating poop, and having sex with antelopes in our town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thomas|Maybe we need to get our kids off of Facebook.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|That\'ll never happen.

You\'re the one who started all this?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh oh.}}\n\n{{ScriptScene|The Kremlin, day. It\'s snowing there. Stephen drags Butters along as they talk over each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|You think you\'re just so smart, don\'t you?! Make me look like a fool, will you?! We\'ll just see about this!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wah. No sir, I, ah. No sir, I just ah.}}\n\n{{ScriptScene|The Kremlin, inside.

Tell Mr. Putin what you told me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well I was just, uh, well, I just said how I just used Facebook like Russia did. And I really didn\'t break any rules.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Didn\'t break any rules?! Good job teaching our children that\'s all that matters! Just because there\'s a way to cause chaos in a town, or disrupt an entire country, doesn\'t mean you go and do it, does it?!

The Coon and Friends are reunited there once again.\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Coon friends, we have done it. Facebook is gone, and Netflix approved our TV show.

And then we-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|How come I have to have the video game? I want a movie too!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You have a movie, Mysterion.
