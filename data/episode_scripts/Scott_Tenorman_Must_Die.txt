Then they could meet Scott Tenorman — \'\'and\'\' — see him get his wiener bitten off by a pony! \'\'[camera pulls back to reveal the setup: pony, scarecrow with wiener attached to groin]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|...What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Don\'t you see? If I can get this pony to bite off Scott\'s wiener in front of Radiohead, then Scott would cry. And if Scott cries, then Radiohead will say Scott Tenorman is totally not cool! And that would make Scott Tenorman wanna die!! \'\'[laughs demonically]\'\' Okay, I\'ll keep working on the pony, you guys go get Radiohead to play here! Ready? Break!! \'\'[nothing happens for a few seconds]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You\'re such a dumbass, Cartman. \'\'[he and Stan turn and walk away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...Fine, I\'ll do it myself!! You guys just watch!! \'\'[walks over to the pony]\'\' Ready, pony? \'\'[the pony nods]\'\' Bite it! \'\'[the pony bites off a piece of the wiener]\'\' Yes!! \'\'[exults]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|London Recording Studio, day. Inside, Radiohead prepares to record. One of them is on the floor reading fan mail}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnny|Thom, will you stop reading fan mail? We have work to do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thom|Just a second, fellas. Listen to this:\n\nDear Radiohead, My name is Eric Cartman. I\'m a young, supple eight-year-old boy from South Park, Colorado. I am writing to you because of a kid I know named Scott Tenorman. Scott is fifteen, and I\'m afraid he has cancer. In his ass. Radiohead is his favorite band, and it would make his short life if you could find it in your hearts to visit him before he dies alone and scared. Won\'t you please consider it? I don\'t think he\'ll make it past... next Tuesday around 5.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Wow, we have to go.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ed|To Colorado? But we have an album to mix.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thom|Didn\'t you hear the letter?? This poor kid has cancer! In his ass!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Scott\'s house, day. A phone rings. Scott answers it in the living room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[voice at other end]\'\' Scott Tenorman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|What do you want?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We just wanna warn you: Eric Cartman, the fourth grader, is going\' to try and trick you somehow into getting your wiener bitten off by a pony who lives at Denkins\' ranch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|How do you know?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'Cause, we\'re his friends.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Then why are you telling me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'Cause we hate him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, we just thought we\'d let you know. See ya.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|See ya. \'\'[the doorbell rings. Scott walks over to open the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|At the front door}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[with tickets in hand]\'\' Hello, Scott!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Hey.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I was just stopping by to invite you to my Chili Con Carnival. It\'s a chili cook-off with rides. \'\'[shows him the face of the ticket]\'\' Everyone\'s coming, and I wanted to drop by your invitation personally!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Ooo, a chili carnival, huh? That sounds great.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[getting smug]\'\' Yeah! There is even gonna be a big surprise, so you won\'t wanna miss it, Scott. Oh, and here! Here\'s a coupon good for one free pony ride!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Wow, a pony ride. Neat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, it will be very neat, Scott.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Gosh. Chili, rides, and ponies? What more could I want?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[under his breath]\'\' A little penis-biting, perhaps?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uhnothing, nuhothing! So you\'ll come for sure then, Scott?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|How can I turn it down?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sweeet. Killer. Bye, Scott. \'\'[Scott turns around and closes the door]\'\' Ohoho, you are good, Eric. You are very, very good. \'\'[leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|back in the living room}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Mom, Dad, that was my good friend Eric at the door? He told me that there\'s a starving pony at Denkins\' ranch that\'s been abandoned. }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tenorman|Oh dear.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Yeah, I feel really bad. But I don\'t know how I can help it, because I have a lot of homework to do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Tenorman|\'\'[drops his paper. Both parents rise]\'\' Well, don\'t you worry, Scott. Your mom and I can go get the pony and have it taken to an animal shelter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tenorman|We sure can.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Wow, would you really? I feel so much better now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tenorman|\'\'[hugs him]\'\' Oh, Scott, you\'re such a loving, caring boy. I\'m so proud of you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|I\'m proud of you, too, Mom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tenorman|Let\'s go, hon. \'\'[heads for the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Tenorman|Let\'s. \'\'[follows her out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|In the kitchen. Scott is cooking up something... his friends arrive}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Buddy 1|What are you doing, Scott?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|What\'s it look like? I\'m making chili. Did you bring the goods?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Buddy 2|\'\'[holds out a bag full of hair]\'\' We got everyone we could find to chip in. \'\'[his friend giggles]\'\' There are pubes from just about every single kid in town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Awesome! \'\'[yanks the bag away, opens it, and mixes the pubes into the chili]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Buddy 1|Oh, dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|The little fat kid thinks he\'s gonna get revenge tomorrow. We\'ll see how he likes it when I tell him he just ate the pubes of every kid in town!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Buddy 2|Yeah! \'\'[hi-fives Scott, and the three laugh heartily]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, next day. The Chili Con Carnival is in full swing. People have already arrived. Stan and Kyle walk up}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[steps out of the ticket booth to greet them]\'\' Oh, hello, guys! Thanks for coming to my Chili Con Carnival!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This is the dumbest thing you\'ve ever done, Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[smug]\'\' Ohoho, it won\'t be so dumb when Scott Tenorman arrives. I suggest you stay to see the fireworks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oho, we will. Trust us. We won\'t miss this. \'\'[looks at Stan, who\'s smiling]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What\'s so funny?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh nothing, it\'s just cool how you\'re gonna get Scott Tenorman back. Is Radiohead here yet?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Not yet, but they will be.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, sure. \'\'[As Chef arrives, Stan and Kyle leave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Hello, Eric!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey, Chef.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I made some chili to enter into the contest.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What contest?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|This is a chili cook-off, ain\'t it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Huh? Oh. Yeah, I guess it is. Uh, here, Chef, just put it over here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|It\'s my special recipe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[seeing Scott, interrupts. Slowly and sweetly]\'\' Scott Tenorman!!! How are you, Scott? Thanks so much for coming! \'\'[Scott holds a small container of chili]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Oh, I wouldn\'t miss this for anything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[overjoyed]\'\' Likewise. Well, come on, you\'ve got to see the pony!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Just a second: don\'t you- wanna taste my chili first?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, e-yeah, but, there\'s a special guest coming, and I want you to be near the pony when they arrive.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Well I don\'t want it to get cold. I think I can win first prize.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[sighs silently]\'\' Alright, Scott, uh. Let\'s go over to the judging table and we\'ll try the chili first. \'\'[Scott leaves]\'\' Goddamnit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, the judging table. Cartman and Scott take their seats. Behind Scott stand Butters, Kyle, Stan, and Scott\'s friends. Behind Cartman stand Bebe, Clyde, and Tolkien}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[setting his plate before Cartman]\'\' Alright, I guess we should taste each other\'s chili, huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[inspecting the dish]\'\' Huh, this chili looks pretty good. Weh, here\'s mine. \'\'[hands his plate to Scott, who takes it to his end of the table and starts eating]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Mmm. Ah, I don\'t know. Your chili is pretty good, Cartman, but I think mine is better. Try it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright. \'\'[takes the dish and starts eating. Both boys munch away for a few moments]\'\' Hey, this is great! \'\'[Stan and Kyle stifle giggles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|Eh, it\'s a special recipe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[begins to wolf down the food]\'\' Gawh, this is really good, Scott!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|I\'m glad you like it so much, because now that you\'re almost finished, I have some\'in\' to tell you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What? You mean about how you put pubes in your chili? \'\'[Everyone at Scott\'s end of the table is shocked, even Scott, at this accusation]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yehes, I\'m afraid this isn\'t your chili, Scott. I switched it with Chef\'s. \'\'[Chef looks like he\'s been used]\'\' It\'s delicious, Chef. I hadn\'t planned on that. What I did plan on, however, was that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili Con Carnival was a trap. \'\'[Stan and Kyle are stunned]\'\' I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins\' pony to bite off your wiener. What they didn\'t tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight. Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr. Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area. \'\'[A shot of Cartman telling Denkins of such a thing. Denkins is armed]\'\' I \'\'also\'\' know that you wouldn\'t go yourself, for fear of having your wiener bitten off. You would most likely send your parents. \'\'[A shot of Scott talking with his parents]\'\' And, I\'m afraid that when Mr. Denkins spotted them on his property, he shot and killed both your parents. \'\'[The Tenormans are in the corral to rescue the "starving" pony, but upon seeing Mr. Tenorman\'s lit flashlight, Mr. Denkins fires at them, and they go down]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Denkins|\'\'[looks of horror surround him]\'\' Well, they was trespassin\' and I was protectin\' myself. I, I have my rights.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|My... mom and dad are... dead? \'\'[A shot of Officer Barbrady taking a report from Denkins]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I came just in time to see Mr. Denkins giving his report to Officer Barbrady. And of course, to steal the bodies... \'\'[A shot of Cartman arriving, seeing Denkins and Barbrady, and pulling the bodies away. The pony munches at some grass]\'\' After a night with the hacksaw, I was all ready to put on my Chili Con Carnival, so that I could tell you personally about your parents\' demise! And of course, feed you your chili. \'\'[more faces of horror behnd Cartman]\'\' Do you like it? Do you like it, Scott? \'\'[A gleefully evil look comes over Cartman]\'\' I call it, "Mr. & Mrs. Tenorman Chili."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[looks at Cartman for a while, realizing what\'s just happened]\'\' Oh my God! \'\'[gagging, he fishes through the plate and finds his mom\'s wedding ring, still on her finger. He tosses it away]\'\' Oh my God!! \'\'[vomits off to the side]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[leaping up on the table and sings] Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! I made you eat your parents! Nyahnyahnyahnyah nyah nyah! [Stan and Kyle are way stunned]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Jesus Christ, dude! }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[grief-stricken, he buries his face on the table]\'\' My mom and dad are dead! \'\'[pounds the table]\'\' No! NOOO!! \'\'[Radiohead arrives and stands behind Scott.

This kid is totally not cool. \'\'[the members of the band start leaving]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Thom|Yeah, that\'s the most uncool kid I\'ve ever met.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil|Little crybaby!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Scott|\'\'[gathers himself and looks]\'\' No, wait!

Oh, let me taste your tears, Scott! \'\'[starts licking Scott\'s tears off his face]\'\' Mm, your tears are so yummy and sweet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, I think it might be best for us to never piss Cartman off again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Good call.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, the tears of unfathomable sadness!
