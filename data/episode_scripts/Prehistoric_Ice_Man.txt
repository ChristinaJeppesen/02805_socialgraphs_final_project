Maybe \'\'we\'\' can get a reward for the \'\'frozen\'\' guy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Both|Hooray!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|For what?}}\n{{ScriptScene|On the road towards town.

The mayor is at the podium and a crowd of townspeople is watching.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Aalll right, people. The next order of business is a very serious matter.

Screw you! \'\'[hits the tardy man, and everyone starts fighting. The boys show up with the ice man]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Huh, excuse me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Not now, kids.

What reward?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|\'\'[arriving]\'\' Mayor, I think the boys may have stumbled onto something here. You see, Mayor, frozen links are often found: dinosaur eggs, woolly mammoths. This specimen could be a missing link \'\'[close-up]\'\' in our evolution. If I can unfreeze the body, and perform an autopsy, I could learn much about this creature\'s people and its time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor|Sure sure sure, be my guest, knock your socks off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|Thank you, Mayor. Oh, and boys, I, I can\'t give you a reward for finding this creature, but if you\'d like, I\'ll let you name him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Really.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sweet. How about Steve?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|Steve it is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wait a minute! His name is Gorak!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|Come on, Steve. We\'ve got work to do. \'\'[pushes Larry away with Kevin. Stan is not happy at Kyle\'s sleight of word]\'\' Unfreezing this body will be quite delicate work. We\'ll have to use the most advanced methods available.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Inside, Dr. Mephesto and Kevin use blow dryers on the ice man. Quite an advanced method.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|This is very exciting. He could be a Neanderthal. Or an Australopithecus from the Paleolithic era. \'\'[turns off the blow dryer and picks up a flashlight to inspect the man]\'\' Do you see that, Kevin? These clothes are from Eddie Bauer. I haven\'t seen anybody wear clothes from Eddie Bauer since... 1996! \'\'[Kevin expresses shock]\'\' This is incredible! Think of all we can learn from this body! All that it can teach us! Let\'s just hope the press doesn\'t get wind of this right away.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The lab door flies open and cameras flash all around.

There\'s nothing to see here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|What about the prehistoric ice man?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Oh, yeah. There is that. \'\'[lowers his arms, and the press rushes in.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Dr. Mephesto, could you \'\'please\'\' tell us what\'s going on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|Ladies and gentlemen, we still have a lot of work to do. \'\'[the press mills around, taking pictures]\'\' But it is my opinion that this man has been frozen in time for over 32 months! \'\'[some reporters gasp]\'\' Yes, it\'s true, although at this early stage we know very little about this man or the time from which he comes.}}\n{{ScriptScene|News 4 Special Report. The caption has a silhouette of a caveman stamped with a question mark.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Fascinating news tonight from South Park. An ancient discovery of a prehistoric man actually \'\'frozen in ice\'\'. A team of scientists continues to try and unfreeze the body so that it can be autopsied, and studied. The caveman was discovered by Kyle Broflovski, who had this to say:}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[Stan and Kenny in the background]\'\' Well, I fell down this ice cavern, \'\'[Stan interrupts him with "la"s]\'\' and I saw this block of ice, so I told my friend to throw a rope- \'\'[Kenny looks at Stan, and Kyle glances back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|The prehistoric ice man is thought to be from the late neo-post-Jurassic era, where he was probably part of a hunting and gathering tribe that lived on Waterston Street.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The genetic engineering ranch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|That\'s it, Kevin. Now we can begin the autopsy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Larry|\'\'[stirs]\'\' Uuuurrr.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|Ugh?

He won\'t understand what he sees! He\'ll be frightened and confused!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Well, you just can\'t let him die.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|Perhaps death is better than the shock he will take trying to adapt to our time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Larry|Uh, ughn.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Mephesto|\'\'[moves towards him]\'\' Oh my God.
