\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Realtors, daytime. The camera begins to slowly move to the right as we see the inside of the office, with phones ringing and the real estate agents talking all at once with different customers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 1|Yes sir. If you\'re looking to move out of the city, I think your family would love South Park. You can get four times the house here that you can get in the city. \'\'[there is a pause]\'\' A cortado? Is that like a coffee? \'\'[another pause]\'\' Yeah, we – we have a coffee shop here. Yes...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 2|We\'re up in the mountains about an hour from Denver. Do you think you could drive out from the city this weekend and I could show you some properties? \'\'[pause]\'\' Oh, you have a Tesla? Oh, how nice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 3|South Park – yeah, it\'s a charming country village. If you\'re able to work from home, I think you\'ll really love it out here. \'\'[pause]\'\' LaCroix? The sparkling mineral water? Yes, I do believe we have that in our stores here...}}\n{{ScriptScene|The camera now focuses on John Aspinal, sitting down on his office chair.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|We\'re seeing a massive influx of city people moving out here to the country. And the truth is we don\'t have enough real estate agents to keep up with all the demand. \'\'[cuts to Liane]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Well, I don\'t have much experience but I thought I\'d give real estate a try.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Mrs. Cartman, being a real estate agent takes a lot of intellect and a lot of raw talent. You have to get your picture taken. Get people to like the picture and go, "Oh, I\'d like to hang out with that person." And then act like you like those people when you show them houses.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Well, I do believe I\'m good with people, and the truth is... I need to do this for my son. Our...rent is going up because of all the new people moving into town – and I don\'t think I can afford it anymore. \'\'[uplifting music begins to play]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Well, then, I am going to give you a shot. Mrs. Cartman. For your little boy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, kitchen, later that same day. Cartman is seen scooping his hand from a jar of Nutella while looking at his tablet. His face is smeared with Nutella.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[struggling with his tablet]\'\' God dammit... Oh! You piece of shit! \'\'[Liane comes into frame a few seconds later]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Hello, sweetie!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mom! Where the hell have you been?! I\'ve been home from school for like 45 minutes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|I\'m sorry, honey, mommy had some errands.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I didn\'t have anything to eat except Nutella. I was about to call Child Services!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Honey... Mommy has some big news. \'\'[she sits down across Cartman at the dinner table]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|I... got a job, Eric. \'\'[menacing music plays]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m your job.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh, honey – It\'s going to be good! Mommy is just going to be working a few days a week and you can be a big boy and take care of yourself.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[begins to get upset]\'\' No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Eric, this has to happen. We can\'t afford to live in this house unless I make more money, and this job pays really well.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wha– what job could you possibly have?! You don\'t know how to do anything!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|I\'m a real estate agent.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[softly]\'\' A what?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, living room, daytime. Butters is seen sitting down at the living room couch watching television and laughing. Seconds later, a knock is heard at the front door. Butters turns off the TV and gets up to answer the front door and Cartman is there. He seems to be carrying something in a duffle bag.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey Butters, I need your help.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well– Well, sure Eric! What\'s goin\' on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters, I have some shocking news... My mom got a job.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[he closes the door]\'\'Oh... Oh, and you\'re worried that maybe now your mom won\'t always be there to take care of you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What? No, my mom got a job. My mom is dumb as shit and somebody is paying her to do something. \'\'[he starts opening the duffle bag, revealing its contents. It is camera equipment.]\'\' Have you ever heard of a real estate agent, Butters?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, not really.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, well, neither had I. \'\'[he continues to set the equipment up as he talks]\'\' So I looked it up on a bunch of those shows and stuff. You don\'t do anything. You just look nice and hug people and then when someone buys a house, you make money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wow! Well, that sounds like a good deal!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s more than a good deal, Butters. It\'s fucking legal theft. If my mom can be a real estate agent, then literally anyone in the world can. \'\'[he pulls out a green screen from his duffle bag and sets it up]\'\' We\'ve got all these people moving from the cities into our town. I can probably be a millionaire in just a few days time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[excitedly]\'\' Wow wee!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[he begins to change into a real estate agent]\'\' Now, whatever you do, don\'t tell anybody. If anyone else finds out about this, they\'ll all want to be real estate agents, too. You\'ve always been great at taking pictures, Butters. \'\'[he poses for the camera and smiles]\'\' I won\'t forget this when I\'m rich.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Gosh, thanks, Eric! \'\'[he takes the picture]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|A random residence, daytime. Outside, there is a South Park Realtors "For Sale sign." Liane is seen with a clipboard on her hand, waiting. A Tesla vehicle starts to pull in as the camera focuses on the license plate. It reads "New York, JBG 1295 Empire State." Liane prepares herself to greet the city people. }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Okay, Liane... you\'ve got this. You can do this! \'\'[she takes a deep breath and walks over to the city people]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Man|\'\'[he hands out bottles of water]\'\' Bottled water. Bottled water.

I\'m Liane Cartman with South Park Realtors!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Man|Uh-huh... uh-huh...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Well, this is the house I was telling you about. It just came on the market. \'\'[she hands out some documents about the house to the city people]\'\' It\'s a 2,300 square foot mid colonial home.

Front yard and backyard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Eric, what are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, I just got some clients here looking to relocate. These people are from the city.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Man 2|Uh, cortado.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Man 3|Bottled water.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Woman 2|Wi-Fi. Pilates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Uh, excuse me one moment. \'\'[she walks over to Cartman and drags him out]\'\' Eric! What are you up to?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I got a job as a real estate agent, mom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|You are not a real estate agent–}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Neither are you–}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Now just march right back home and I will see you when I am done with work!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mom, real estate is an open market. You\'re not the only one who gets to take advantage of all the city people. \'\'[camera cuts back to the city people gathered around as they say things like cortado, bottled water, Wi-Fi, etc.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|\'\'[assertively]\'\' Eric, this house is being represented by South Park Realtors.

There is a meeting happening.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|People, this is the most exciting time in the history of South Park. As you know, there are people from all over the country leaving the cities and coming to small, rural towns like ours.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Adler|It\'s truly incredible for all of us. With this new surge of people from urban areas, we\'re seeing more town money from sales taxes, more profit in our local businesses–}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harriet|My bakery has seen a 20% increase in sales. Oh, I just love all these city people moving in!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tuong Lu Kim|That\'s right. It\'s great to have shitty people. These shitty people come with their fancy shitty crothes and their big shitty cars. You know, and these shitty people have a shitty way of doing things that will expose us all to their shitty ideas.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Yeah, and they\'ve got city money and city lifestyles!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tuong Lu kim|Shitty money, shitty lifestyles. And they\'ll move here and bring their shitty famiries. And their cultured, shitty kids will hang out with our kids and expose them to their shitty ways.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|I\'ve always dreamed of South Park becoming more than a little hick town. \'\'[the music intensifies]\'\' And these city people bring with them... a new hope.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Harriet|Here\'s to the future, everyone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|All|The future!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Tweak Residence, Living room.

Tweek, Richard and Mrs. Tweak are eating together at the dinner table.

Door in the back gets you out to the garage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Excuse me, what are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Just showing them your house. Come on, let\'s check out the second floor–}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Our house isn\'t for sale! Hey! \'\'[gets up from his chair]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Upstairs bathroom. Tweek\'s grandma is seen using the toilet. Cartman walks in, scaring the grandmother.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Nice, big bathroom for the two rooms up here. Tweek\'s grandma is staying in one of the rooms, which serves as an office space when she\'s not here.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back in the living room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|And then, we are back down to the spacious living room!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Will you please get out of our house?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, we\'re just about done– well, what do you guys think?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Boy|Macbook, Tesla?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m sorry, I didn\'t get that...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|City Man|My son left his MacBook in the Tesla.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, sure, well, let\'s head on out now. We can take a lot at Jimmy\'s house. \'\'[he starts to leave]\'\' It doesn\'t have such sucky furniture. \'\'[the city people head outside]\'\' Let me talk to these guys and see if we can come up with a number. \'\'[he hands Richard a business card.]\'\' I think I can get you 4 million for this place.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Four million dollars, really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'ll be in touch. \'\'[he leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Tweak|Told you our furniture sucked! \'\'[she walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside of South Park Realtors, daytime. All the city people are seen gathering around the building talking all at once. On the windows, there are some house listings. The camera cuts to inside the office.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Realtor|Hey– Hey, John, I got some bad news. We just lost another client to the South Park Realty Group.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Realtor|We\'re losing people like crazy! These guys are ruthless.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Who is this South Park Realty Group?! Has anyone heard of them?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Realtor|\'\'[points at the documents in the folder]\'\' It appears to be mostly one agent.

Call SOUTH PARK REALTY GROUP to satisfy any real estate needs."]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Oh my god... That\'s a pretty damn good picture. How\'d he get that kind of depth of field?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Realtor|I don\'t know he\'s gotta be using some kind of soft filter– nothing I\'ve ever seen!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Alright, everyone! Looks like we\'ve got some competition! If anyone thinks they can take our clients, they\'ve got another thing coming. Everyone, get up. We\'re gonna retake our pictures.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Realtors|Awwwww!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|No, no, no, we\'re getting our butts kicked, and we need to show this kid what we can do!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Some time later. All of the realtors are retaking their pictures. One realtor goes up and attempts to remain his posture, but it becomes difficult to keep it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Come on, Chris! You gotta look really welcoming!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|\'\'[struggling]\'\' Ugh. I\'m trying–}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Come on, arch your back more!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|I\'m, ugh, arched as far as I can...!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|John|Come on, Chris, you wanna lose another sale?!

Are you dreaming of moving out of the city and into the countryside? I want you to check out Clyde\'s house.

Isn\'t this nice, Butters?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah, it\'s real roomy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Just look at these amenities.}}\n{{ScriptScene|As the montage plays out again, the camera shows the living room couch, the kitchen sink, a random chair and a toilet. It cuts again to Cartman opening up the backyard glass door and walking out to the backyard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|These giant, glass double doors lead to the unfinished backyard. Plenty of room here for a pool or a horse stable.\'\'[camera zooms out]\'\' This is just one of the amazing properties we have at South Park Realty Group.

Get out of the city and into beautiful South Park.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The montage comes to a close. Various cars begin to come in from the highway and air horns start to blare.
