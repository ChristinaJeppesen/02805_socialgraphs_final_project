I am not gay, and I sure as hell ain\'t no fish! Alright?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom Snyder|You. Really. Don\'t. Get it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|Hey man, I\'m a genius, alright?!

Ha ha ha ha haaa ha! Jimmy, I\'ve been thinking: We\'ve got to patent the fishsticks joke.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|P-patent?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah dude, there\'s lots of people out there using our joke on their shows. We should be getting compensated.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, Eric, th-that\'s really not how jokes work. I mean, you know, we should just be... happy that the joke is so popular and made a lot of people laugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, fuck that! Maybe you were writing jokes for people\'s amusement, but I don\'t work for free. I\'m gonna talk to a lawyer so we get what\'s coming to us! \'\'[smiles, takes his tray and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Jimmy, exactly what part of the fishsticks joke did Cartman write?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, he didn\'t actually... write any of it. He just uh...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Let me guess: you wrote the joke, and Cartman just laid on the couch eating Twizzlers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Actually it was potato chips.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I knew it! Don\'t let that fat turd walk all over you, Jimmy! Stand up for yourself!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|W-well, I-I mean he, he was in the room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Then just give him half.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|I like you Jimmy, but you\'re not gonna win this. Consider yourself lucky he\'s only asking for half.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Craig, if Cartman didn\'t do anything, then he doesn\'t deserve any of the credit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Yep. And if I had wheels, I\'d be a wagon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No dude, screw that! Jimmy, if Cartman didn\'t write the joke, then definitely don\'t sign any patent papers with him! Just say "Cartman, you didn\'t have anything to do with this joke and you know it!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Just give him half.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kanye speaks to a group of reporters at a conference somewhere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|There are a lot of people out there making up rumors about me that are malicious and untrue. But I\'m going to prove once and for all: I\'m not a fish. Because I am a genius, I\'ve ascertained that fish have gills. \'\'[a doctor steps up next to him]\'\' Doctor, do I have gills?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|He does not have gills.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|You hear that? No gills! So I can\'t be a fish. And I\'m a genius voice of a generation so I\'m not gay! So that is that! Alright?! It\'s over! Now are there any questions?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter 1|Do you like fishsticks?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|Love \'em!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter 2|You\'re a gay fish. \'\'[a third reporter laughs and soon the rest of the room is laughing]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|No I\'m not- AAAARGH! \'\'[grabs the sides of the podium and shakes with anger]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Late Night with Conan O\'Brien.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Conan O\'Brien|Alright, recently... Recently we\'ve all come to know the fishsticks joke as probably the funniest, most awesome joke ever, but who originally came up with it? Well here\'s your answer. Joining us tonight, the brains behind the incredible fishsticks joke, the one and only Carlos Mencia.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carlos Mencia|\'\'[dancing in his seat]\'\' Yeheah, Vive la Mexico!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Conan O\'Brien|So Carlos, you\'ve got a show on Comedy Central, a stand-up tour, where did you have time to come up with this classic joke?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mencia|Well you know I just kicking it with my homies and my brain, you know, my brain is always so full of ideas \'cause I\'m so fonny and stuff, so I was just all like, ""Hey, Papito, you like fishsticks?" And my homeboy says "Yeah Carlos" you know, "you\'re so funny!" And then it just occurred to me. I said, "Oh man, you must be a gay fish, homes!" \'\'[the studio audience roars with laughter, and he begins to dance in his seat again]\'\' And this is how I came up with it, mi amigos! \'\'[Conan claps. Cartman, looking at the show on TV, is pissed off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[shakes with rage, then turns left and walks away]\'\' Motherfucker!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day.

Carlos Mencia is taking credit for \'\'our joke\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah dude. I told you this would happen. Now look, I got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers. We\'ve got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Aahhm, I don\'t know, Eric. I really don\'t think I want to sign that very much.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But Jimmy, some fat turd is taking credit for something he didn\'t do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, to be perfectly f-f-f-frank, Eric, I think I came up with a little bit more of the joke than you did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well, you know, I mean, I basically wrote the thing, and you just kind of ate chips.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Jimmy, that\'s messed up. We decided that day to write together. Don\'t you remember?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman remembers entering Jimmy\'s house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey Jimmy, wanna hang out?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Sorry Eric, but I\'ve gotta write some jokes. Unless you wanna team up or somethin\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Team up? Okay, let\'s write some jokes together.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sarah|Here\'s some fishsticks guys. I hope you like fishsticks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Do we like fishsticks? What does she think we are? Gay fish? \'\'[Jimmy and Cartman laugh, but Cartman notices something on Jimmy\'s desk.]\'\' Uh oh, look out, Jimmy, it\'s a black widow! \'\'[gets off the couch, gets a newspaper, walks over to the desk, and smashes the spider dead.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow, thanks Eric.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back to the present. Jimmy looks helpless.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Is that... Is that how it happened?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Look, exactly who came up with which part of the joke isn\'t even relevant. We had an agreement Jimmy. And if you wanna go back on that now, well then you\'re no better than a Jew.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|I\'m... I\'m sorry?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s cool man, it\'s cool. \'\'[turns around and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kanye West in Concert, night. at an indoor arena looking similar to Madison Square Garden}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Here he is, y\'all!

Why is everyone calling me a gay fish?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|House|Kanye, look, we all think it would be better if you would just drop it. Ya-you know, I mean, ih-if you don\'t get it, you don\'t get it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|What do you mean, I don\'t get it, House?! I\'m a genius. I\'ll understand it, I just need to break it down is all. Now let\'s see... \'\'[he\'s writing on a whiteboard.

Then under me we have rapper, genius. And gay fish are homosexual. They swim. \'\'[begins connecting words]\'\' Is it because breaded has something to do with genius? Which swims?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|House|No, because you said you like fish dicks, Kanye! Don\'t, don\'t you get it? You see, fish \'\'dicks\'\' is a is a play on words.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|I don\'t need anyone tellin\' me "play on words"!

I\'m peeing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[walks off a bit]\'\' It\'s just... I don\'t know what to do about Jimmy.

I believe you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yes, I believe that you believe you helped write that joke. That\'s how people like you work!

"Do you like fishsticks?"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Right.

Well, about a week ago our country was blessed with the fishsticks joke.

Please welcome the comedy team of Cartman and Valmer. \'\'[Cartman and Jimmy go onstage and sit on the couch facing Ellen]\'\' Hey guys!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hi Ellen. \'\'[to the audience]\'\' Do you guys like fishsticks? \'\'[the audience laughs]\'\' Thank you, thank you.

You serve, and the other person hits it back. It bounces off the wall, you backhand it. And it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully you\'ve got a good joke. Thank you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ellen|But guys, this joke is so... perfect. Can you explain how nobody thought of it before?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Well Ellen, the tr- tr- tr-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before. I mean let\'s be perfectly honest: a lot of people wouldn\'t work with someone who\'s disabled. But I see past that. I look beyond Jimmy\'s disabilities and find ...a bond which can unite us in comedy. Working with crippled people is really ...important. \'\'[the audience applauds and cheers]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ellen|That\'s so great. And, and are you crying, Jimmy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Yes Ma\'am. \'\'[the best and worst of times for him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ahaw don\'t cry, pal. You\'re gonna get \'\'me\'\' started.

It\'s my best pal, Eric!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[moves the glasses back over his cap]\'\' What are you up to?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|I\'m trying to write jokes. But I\'m not as funny as you, so it\'s tough.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, maybe I can help you. We can team up. \'\'[goes for a chair]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Ruh really? Wow, you would help me even though I\'m crippled. You are caring and not fat. \'\'[hands his joke sheet to Cartman as Cartman brings the chair over and sits next to him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Now let\'s see, how about a joke that has something to do with... fishsticks. You know, \'cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks, Jimmy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sarah|\'\'[brings in a plate of potato chips]\'\' Eric Cartman, you are handsome and not even remotely fat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Thanks. \'\'[Sarah walks away]\'\' So, what I\'m thinking is, "Do you like fishsticks in your mouth?" \'\'[something crashes into the house, making it shake violently. Jimmy and Cartman look around.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|What was that? \'\'[Butters opens the door and steps in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Eric! Eric, you have to save us! An entire army of Jew robots! \'\'[outside, everyone scatters as robots march down the street firing off semiautomatic weapons. Cartman runs out to see what\'s happening. Butters and Jimmy follow right behind. Officer Barbrady and Mayor McDaniels look on helplessly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my God, what are Jewbots doing here? \'\'[takes off his glasses]\'\' Flame on! \'\'[becomes engulfed in flames and flies into the air. He then sends streams of flames at the robots, destroying them instantly. He flies back down to his starting point]\'\' Flame off! \'\'[the flames disappear. Other fourth graders appear: Annie, Millie, Red, Clyde, Tolkien and Wendy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|You saved everyone from the Jewbots, Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Come on, Jimmy, we gotta go back and finish that joke! \'\'[runs in and finishes the joke in a flourish. Jimmy walks in]\'\' "Like fishsticks in your mouth? What are you a gay fish?" There! \'\'[other kids look in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Wow Eric, in-credible! Too bad I\'m a dick and I\'m gonna take all the credit. Su-su-suck it, bitch!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back to the present.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aw dammit! I guess it really was all me who came up with it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You\'ve gotta let Jimmy go, it\'s all my fault.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Jesus Eric, he\'s gonna kill you! You won\'t even admit it was just me, knowing you\'re gonna die?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Jimmy, you really believe that you came up with it all on your own? Oh my God, wait. I totally get it now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|What? I, I still don\'t get anything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All this time I\'ve been mad at you, Jimmy, for trying to take all the credit, but, now I realize it\'s just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently. That\'s what Kyle was trying to tell me. That you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Rih, r-r-really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I thought you were just trying to Jew me out of my part of the credit, but now I realize that... some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them, they can\'t accept the truth of who they are. \'\'[Kanye looks as if Cartman is talking about him]\'\' Jimmy, I owe you an apology. I realize now you can\'t help believing you created the entire joke, because your ego won\'t let you think otherwise. I just have to accept that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Thanks, Eric, for being so understanding.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|He\'s right. For so long I\'ve considered myself God\'s gift to the world that I couldn\'t take it when people made fun of me. But they weren\'t makin\' fun of me. They were tryin\' to help me. \'\'[walks up to the boys and genuflects before them]\'\' Boys I understand what you did now. \'\'[to his men]\'\' Untie them guys.

You sure about this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kanye|It\'s time for me to stop runnin\'. I need to believe what people tell me. \'\'[turns and faces his entourage.]\'\' Let all my fans know I love \'em, but a gay fish just can\'t live in the outside world forever. Don\'t be sad for me guys! \'\'[turns around, runs, and dives into the ocean below]\'\' I\'m goin\' home! \'\'[his crew looks down into the water as Kanye begins swimming in his new environment]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The waters off Santa Monica Beach.

He spots a yellow fish and lets it circle him a few times. He then hugs it and takes it to the surface. He then gives it a French kiss, then flips backwards into the water with it. He swims again, alone, when a large fish begins to follow him. He notices, swims to it, and begins to rub against it. Then he just swims with it, hugging its belly.}}}}\n{{Episodemedia13|episode=05}}\n[[zh:鱼肉棒/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Thirteen]]'}]}}}}
