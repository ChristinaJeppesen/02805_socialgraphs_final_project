An anchor soon appears with a window of Mr. Garrison beside him}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchor|Kindergarten teacher Herbert Garrison has apparently invented a new vehicle that will give the airlines a run for their money. Mr. Garrison is putting the final touches on his top secret device, which he simply calls "IT". \'\'["IT" appears in the window]\'\' So what exactly is "IT"? \'\'["IT?" appears in the window]\'\' Here with a report is a Hispanic man with some gravy stains on his lapel. \'\'[a window with that reporter pops up and soon fills the screen.

So far, Herbert Garrison hasn\'t let anyone get a look at his invention. He claims that the vehicle is sooo genius and revolutionary that it could cause one\'s eyes to bleed if not properly prepared to see it. But earlier today HBC News got footage of some of the country\'s top investors and richest people who have been invited for a first look, including: Steve Forbes \'\'[seen exiting a black limo]\'\', Steve Jobs \'\'[seen exiting a white limo]\'\', Ted Turner \'\'[seen exiting a helicopter]\'\', Donald Trump \'\'[seen exiting a private jet]\'\', Bill Gates \'\'[seen leaving his own ship, the U.S.S.
