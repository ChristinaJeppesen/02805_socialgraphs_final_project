I-I really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marijawana--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|It was an error of judgment, Mr. Mackey, but \'\'I\'m\'\' afraid I have to let you go for it. We searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|But--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|We had to let them go home, and one of them now has half a lid of Jamaican grass because of \'\'you!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Huh, how am I going to make ends meet...m-\'\'[Sniff.]\'\'m\'kay?
