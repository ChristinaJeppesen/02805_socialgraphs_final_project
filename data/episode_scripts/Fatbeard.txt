That is an awesome idea. You should totally go to Somalia.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Right, and wi- \'\'[stops]\'\' Wait a minute. You never think my ideas are good, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, I\'m being totally serious. That is the best idea you\'ve ever had. You should run away to Mogadishu.

To adventure!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The flight path is shown. It follows the path Cartman traced on the map. Butters is giddy looking out the window. As the plane crosses the Atlantic the boys play in their seats. Once the plane reaches Cairo, the boys transfer onto a bus and go south across Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, and finally Somalia, ending in Mogadishu. A shot of the city from the air, looking east. The bus stops and everyone gets off. The road underneath it is dusty. The boys walk away from the bus, then it rolls off. They can\'t believe what they see.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|This is Somalia?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Where\'s all the waterfalls and shi-and shipwreck lagoons?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|The FUCK?! \'\'[some Somalis notice them and stop to look]\'\' \'Scuse me, where are the pirates? \'\'[stops a man walking by]\'\' Hey, hey we\'re looking for the pirates?
