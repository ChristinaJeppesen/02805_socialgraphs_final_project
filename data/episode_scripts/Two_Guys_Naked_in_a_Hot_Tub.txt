We\'re Charlie\'s Angels, but we don\'t have a mission.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey, that\'s because we need Bosley. Uh Bosley always told the Angels what their mission was. Remember Bosley? Wah uhwhy uhwhy we need somebody to be Bosley. \'\'[strokes his chin. All three look around, but the silence alerts Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[looks back displeased]\'\' What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Well, we hate to trouble you, Stan, but would you mind terribly being Bosley for us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[grudgingly]\'\' What do I have to do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh you just got- you just gotta tell us what our mission is, that\'s all. That\'s all Bosley does. Just give a mission, and us Angels will accomplish it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright, alright. Here\'s your mission.

I just... miss being able to party. Drinking and socializing, and experimenting with all kinds of different things.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Well, that\'s what being young is all about. Once you have a family and a career, your experimenting days are over. But tonight is the exception; that\'s why I\'m gonna smoke this cigar. \'\'[brushes it under his nose and sniffs it]\'\' Only \'cause I\'ve never smoked before. \'\'[picks up a lighter and lights the cigar, then sets the lighter back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Good idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|What haven\'t you tried that you\'ve always wanted to try?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hohn. \'\'[raises his elbows to the rim]\'\' Um, I don\'t know.

Oh, you mean, this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah. That, that was me.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The basement. Pip rushes up to Stan}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Bosley!

Well, they say everybody has at some point, don\'t they?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Well, I never really wanted to experiment with anything too crazy. You know... maybe just... I don\'t know... masturbate in front of another guy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah well, that, that\'s not really ...gay, is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|NO, no, uh I don\'t think so.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|...Well it is a night for experimenting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Sure is. \'\'[both of them wait for the other to make the first move, then...]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Okay, I\'ll start. \'\'[begins]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|some activity is going on out on the street.

They\'ve got all kinds of crazy stuff going on in there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|ATF agent|\'\'[talks into a communicator]\'\' Code 7. We believe we have found the compound.

It\'s our \'\'job\'\' to know what these fanatics do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|So what does the ATF do when religious fanatics are gonna commit mass suicide?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|ATF lead|Oh, don\'t worry! We won\'t let that happen! Even if it means we have to kill each and every one of them.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Out front, later.

A technician readies the large CD player]\'\' Play really bad music really loud until it drives them nuts and makes them want to come out. \'\'[the technician presses a button and a garbled song plays]\'\' Nobody can stand this much Cher. This is her new album. If this doesn\'t drive them out, nothing will.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Living room, the stereo. Mr. Mackey turns on the very same song and starts dancing to it}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|That\'s great music, Mr. Mackey. What is that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Uh this is Cher. This is her new album.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well, hell, turn it up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Living room, away from the stereo. Randy is walking around. Two men talk in the foreground}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Goateed man|Yeah, well, you know what I heard? I I heard that he\'s gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Other man|Oh, is he?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[runs up]\'\' Who?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Goateed man|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Who who did you hear is, is gay?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Goateed man|Ricky Martin, the singer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh. \'\'[the two men walk away as Gerald approaches]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Hey, Randy, what\'s up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[tenses up]\'\' What the hell is that supposed to mean?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ssh-shouldn\'t you be hangin\' out with your wife right now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Wulluh uh I just felt like talkin\' to you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|There\'s nothing to talk about.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|You\'re having regrets, aren\'t you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|No, I-... I don\'t know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Hey. Talk to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I thought we agreed what happened in the hot tub wouldn\'t change our relationship.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Will you stop it?! I don\'t... I just...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Hey, Mr. Withdrawn, \'\'you\'\' might not need to talk about it, but \'\'I\'\' sure do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Aaww! \'\'[rushes away]\'\' Sharon? \'\'[finds her at a table and genuflects]\'\' Sharon, cuh can we go?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[swaying]\'\' Go?? The meteor shower hasn\'t even started yet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[his voice grows urgent]\'\' Uh I know, but I want to make love to you right now. I have to make love to you right now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy, relax. We don\'t ever get to party. Now come on! Loosen up! Experiment!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ogh, I already did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[rushes up with the other boys]\'\' Dad! Dad, they shot at us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Not now, Stanley. \'\'[gets up and walks away. Stan watches him go, then turns to Sharon]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mom!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Whoopee! \'\'[gets up, and the bowl of chips drops to the ground. She faints on the table. Stan looks around, not sure how he can rouse the adults to action, drunk as they are.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[panicking]\'\' Hey, what are we gonna do, huh?! Ughuh uh they shot at us! They really shot at us! They, they ain\'t gonna stop until we\'re all dead, I betcha. Huh us and all our families.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[slaps Butters across the face with a backhand and grabs him by the collar]\'\' Get a hold of yourself, man!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|How come you slapped my face, Stan, huh? Why uhwhy on earth would you do that, anyways?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on. We have to find out what\'s happening. \'\'[leads the other boys to the bedroom]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mackey\'s bedroom. The boys enter and check out the news again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|I\'m standing now with Danny Ganz, the commander of the ATF. Commander, what is the latest?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|We have not had any cooperation with the cult inside the house. They are refusing to come out, and apparently they still plan to commit mass suicide once the meteor shower starts, which should be any moment now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dougie|See how reporters get to wear those cool jackets? That\'s why I wanna be a reporter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|So what are your plans, commander?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|Right now, our plan is to burn the house down. If we set it on fire, they\'ll have no choice but to come out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh dear God, they\'re gonna set us on fire. Uhoh, great Jesus, son of Mary, wife of Joseph, what are we gonna do, huh? Huhoh, sweet Joseph, husband of Mary but not father of sweet Jesus-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Setting them on fire seems a little dangerous, commander.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|It is, but we can\'t let them kill themselves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We have to let them know that this isn\'t a cult party.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|But we can\'t. They\'ll just shoot at us again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uhuh, they\'re gonna burn us up and act like nothin\' happened. Oh, sweet Jesus, Mary, mother of Jesus, wife of Joseph, father to Mary, well- Wait. Mary, wife uh... Oh, hold on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, Angels. We\'ve got a new mission. And this time, it\'s for real. \'\'[walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside. The reporter continues}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|For hours now, the ATF has tried to communicate with the religious fanatics inside this house. The meteor shower is expected to begin at any moment, and so time is running out.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Inside, the party continues.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Hoh, look. Harold\'s doing it again, hm huh hnmkay? \'\'[Harold is wearing a lampshade, but he\'s fully dressed. The camera moves to the crowd, then to the ground, where Dougie is standing with microphone in hand]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dougie|This is Jill Munroe reporting live from inside the meteor shower party. \'\'[Stan is filming, Butters is cuing]\'\' As you can see, this is a perfectly normal party. Nobody is killing themselves. We tried to tell ATF people, but they shot at us. \'\'[aside]\'\' Anything else?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Tell them not to burn us down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dougie|Oh yeah. Don\'t burn us, please. Jill Munroe, GFN news.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Now what do we do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[removing the tape from the camera]\'\' Now we find a way to get this tape to the real reporters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dougie|Hey, I\'m a real reporter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You\'re right. You are, Dougie. You did an awesome job. \'\'[Dougie smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside, Ganz is back behind the firing line with the bullhorn}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|Attention, cult people! Do not commit mass suicide! There are so many reasons not to kill yourselves! Flowers, for instance. And back rubs. \'\'[turns off the bullhorn and listens for a moment]\'\' Alright, I\'m through trying to reason with them. Send in the Negotiator! \'\'[a large truck hauls a large cannon in. The barrel of the cannon reads, "NEGOTIATOR"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|\'\'[approaches]\'\' Excuse me, but what proof do you have that those people inside are religious fanatics?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|We know what we\'re doing. We did this all before in Waco.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Uh yes, but you totally screwed up Waco. You killed a bunch of innocent people and then tried to say they killed themselves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|\'\'[holds out a beanie baby]\'\' Look. You see this? You see this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|You see it? You see it? Go get it. \'\'[throws it away to his left]\'\' Go get it! \'\'[the reporter soon moves in the direction of the throw]\'\' Alright, let\'s get ready to kick some religious fanatic ass!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Inside. Randy is scarfing down some nachos at the snack table, and Gerald approaches him. Randy sees him and gives him the evil eye, then moves to the mai tai bowl. Gerald follows. Randy glowers at him}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Having a good time?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, swell! Could I just... have a few minutes alone?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I\'m not gonna let you change on me, Randy. Just because we shared an intimate moment in the hot tub, I won\'t let it change our friend-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[irritated, interrupts]\'\' We did not share an intimate moment, okay?! That makes it sound gay! \'\'[walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside. The front door opens and six guests exit}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guest|Good night, everyone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|Look out! \'\'[Shooting starts. Screams are heard as the guests are hit. The guests die on the spot]\'\' Ho-old your fire! Okay, hrm. \'\'[on the bullhorn]\'\' People at the door! That was a warning! Go back inside and tell the others that they now have one minute to surrender! \'\'[the Negotiator is aimed right at the front door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys are in Mr. Mackey\'s bedroom. From outside, the boys are seen looking out the window}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh no, we\'re out of time! \'\'[hops down and moves away. He ties some rope around Butters\' middle]\'\' Are you sure you can do this, Butters?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wuh, no, I\'m not sure. Uh-I\'m not sure at all. Wha-what am I doin\' again?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'re just gonna slide you down this rope, and then you\'ve gotta get our exclusive video to that reporter down there. \'\'[hands him the video]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Tha-at sounds awful dangerous.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Can you hit a target, Pip?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|\'\'[with bow and plunger]\'\' I was archery-class esquire at Stratfordshire. \'\'[pulls back on the bow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hit something nice and solid now. \'\'[Pip releases the plunger, with rope attached, and it lands on the left side of Barbrady\'s head.

Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright, Butters. Now it\'s your turn. \'\'[he and Dougie help Butters onto the window sill and hook him up to the rope]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wha-ah I don\'t know about this, uh. I think I\'ll reconsider. Yep uh I think reconsiderin\' is the thing to do right now. \'\'[Dougie pushes him off]\'\' Waaah! \'\'[slides down to Barbrady and bounces off the hook]\'\' Gooh. \'\'[runs to the reporter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He made it down. \'\'[Pip and Dougie grin]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ganz|Alright, people, prepare to fire on my command! \'\'[the agents take aim]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uhuh, Mr. Reporter, sir?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uhuh wuhwe\'ve got an eyewitness exclusive video for you, sir. \'\'[hands it to the reporter, who inspects it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Inside, living room.

Everybody knows.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Everybody doesn\'t know. And why are you so ashamed of me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What\'s happened to you?! You\'ve become all needy and talkative and-!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I just want to know it meant something to you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|It didn\'t mean anything to me, Gerry! \'\'[the music stops]\'\' All we did was watch each other masturbate in the hot tub! \'\'[people turn and stare.

Yeah, it\'s true! I thought it would be exciting, and maybe it was, but I can\'t deal with your accusing stares! \'\'[shots of various people looking at him]\'\' We watched each other jack off in the hot tub! There! We did it! I\'m not proud of it, but there it is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mackey|Uh. Well, it\'s not like you\'re the only guy who\'s ever watched another guy masturbate; I\'ve done it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ned|Mmm-me too. \'\'[other men begin to answer]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 1|Yeah, uh I\'ve done it a few times.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 2|Yep.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 3|Yup.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 4|Uh huh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 5|Me too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 6|Myeup, me too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 7|Yup.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Aw, hell, uh I\'ve done it too.
