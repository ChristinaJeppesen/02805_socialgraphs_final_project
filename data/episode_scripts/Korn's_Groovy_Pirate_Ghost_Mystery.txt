How?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Blond|Well, I\'m afraid that... somebody dug her up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Dug her up? Why??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brunet|Well.

I told you this would happen! \'\'[survivors sit up and begin to look his way]\'\' When you allow bands like KoRn to come to town and play your hedonistic Halloween concerts, this is what you get!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The docks. KoRn is practicing on stage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Great rehearsal, gang. That was really groovy. Let\'s practice one more time before the show starts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|DJ|Aah, guys, I\'m sorry, but the Halloween Haunt\'s been cancelled.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Cancelled?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|DJ|You best clear out of here! There\'s pirate ghosts, and they\'ll kill you. \'\'[leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Well gang, it looks like we have to pack it up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Others|Awww. \'\'[Stan and friends walk towards the stage]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|God-damnit! \'\'Now\'\', what the hell are we gonna do?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Munky|Oh, hey! The kids from last night.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Head|Wow! Is that the Antonio Banderas life-sized blow-up doll? \'\'[Kenny catches up with his friends]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|Hey, Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[frustrated]\'\' (Aw, man!) \'\'[he can\'t impress anyone]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Say, what\'s the matter? You kids look kind of glum.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Somebody took my dead grandma.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We dug her up \'cause we wanted to scare the fifth graders, but then, something took her body away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Now she\'s doomed to walk the earth in limbo. \'\'[starts to sob]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|Aw, I hate to see little clowns cry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Well, that does it. Somethin\' funny is going on here. Your missing grandma must be connected somehow to those creepy pirate ghosts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|They\'re not pirate ghosts, Jonathan, they\'re ghost pirates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|"Pirate ghost" would suggest that a pirate died, and became a ghost, but a ghost pirate is a ghost that later made a conscious decision to be a pirate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Munky|No, David. Then they \'\'are\'\' pirate ghosts, because they\'re the ghosts of pirates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|You\'re wrong, because there were no pirates in Colorado. So these must be ghosts that have decided to become pirates after the fact.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|But that makes them pirate ghosts.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|No. It makes them ghost pirates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Munky|Pirate ghosts!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Head|Guys! Guys! Guys! Fighting isn\'t gonna solve anything. Don\'t you see? This is exactly what those ghost pirates want us to do.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|\'\'Pirate ghosts.\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Then, you\'ll help us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Sure, we\'ll help you. If there\'s one thing we like more than playing music, it\'s solvin\' a groovy mystery.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Boys|Al-right!}}\n{{ScriptScene|City Hall. People are still laying on floor. Chef arrives}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Is everybody okay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|\'\'[people gather around Chef]\'\' People stealing bodies to have sex with them? Pirate ghosts destroying the town? When did everything go so wrong?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I hate to say it, but I think Priest Maxi was right. This is what we get for celebrating Halloween and allowing that band KoRn to come play.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|He\'s right! Nothin\' ever went wrong in this town before that evil KoRn band showed up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Well, I say we go find them and kick their devil-worshiping butts out of town!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|Yeah! \'\'[various exclamations follow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Lynch mob! \'\'[torches and pitch forks appear and the crowd begins to move]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Down with KoRn!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Halloween night, the docks. KoRn and the boys are still talking...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|So this is where you last saw your dead grandma.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Right. \'\'[Kenny walks along the shore way in the background]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Maybe there really are pirate ghosts and they took her inside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Alright, gang, we have to split up and look for clues.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|How should we split up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|I know. Let\'s have everyone who enjoys having obstacles in their life, which they can overcome, go this way, \'\'[points to his right]\'\' and everyone whose insecurities sabotage their potential to overcome those obstacles go that way. \'\'[points to his left]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|KoRn|O-kay! \'\'[the groups separates in two. In the secure group are Stan, Kyle, Jonathan, Munky, and Fieldy. In the insecure group are Cartman, Kenny, David, and Head]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wow! That was easy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The lynch mob reaches the docks and head for the van. Randy reaches it first.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[excitedly]\'\' Here\'s their van! Here\'s their van!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman|Let\'s flip it over!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Some Folks|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|\'\'[moves to intervene]\'\' Okay, people, let\'s try to stay orderly. The best way to do this is, all get on one side and push it from the top. \'\'[the crowd moves in and starts pushing. Even Barbrady participates]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Devil worshipers! \'\'[the van tips over]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man 2|Come on, they gotta be around here somewhere!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A warehouse. The secure group walks along with Nibblet. Munky is not with them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This place gives me the creeps.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Say, this looks like a clue. \'\'[picks up a book: "Pirate Lore of South Park, By A.R.R. Robbins"]\'\' "Pirate Lore of South Park." Hmmm. Now, why would pirate ghosts need a book on pirates? \'\'[something metallic falls]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Whoa. What was that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|The noise came from in here. Stay close, everybody! \'\'[opens a door and goes in. The rest follow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|\'\'[runs into a supporting pole]\'\' Oh, no! I lost my glasses.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The insecure group walks in a darkened part of the warehouse. Munky is in that group now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Head|What does this dead grandma look like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh, she was all, like, crunchy and crispy and stuff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|Hey, I got an idea. \'\'[all stop]\'\' We should set a groovy trap.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Munky|Good idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|How do we trap a bunch of pirate ghosts?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|We need something that might catch their eye to use as bait. I know, your Antonio Banderas love doll.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[holds the doll tight]\'\' Oh, no! This is \'\'my\'\' Christmas present! If anything happens to it, my mom will know I opened it early!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Munky|Come on, kid. We all have to do our part, even Antonio.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The lit side of the warehouse. Fieldy is still looking for his glasses}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|My glasses gotta be around here somewhere. \'\'[a peg-legged pirate ghost appears next to him]\'\' Is that you, Jonathan? Boy, I\'m glad to see you. I lost my glasses.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Peg-leg|Raaarrrgh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|Hey, you got a cold, Jonathan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Peg-leg|Raarraarrgh! \'\'[canned laughter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|Yeah, that sounds like a groovy song, man! Remember that one! \'\'[more canned laughter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|\'\'[from the other end of the room]\'\' Fieldy, what are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|\'\'[turns to face him]\'\' Oh, I was talking to you, Jonathan. ...Hey, wait a minute. If you\'re over there, then how could you be over here? Unless you\'re actually a...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|All|Puh-puuhh pirate ghost! \'\'[all scatter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Peg-leg|Raaarrrgh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The darkened part of the warehouse. The trap is set}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|Okay. Here\'s how the trap will work. When the pirate ghosts walk in, they should go right for Antonio Banderas. \'\'[the camera now follows the trap as David describes it]\'\' When they hit the super-slippery floor, they\'ll slide onto this mining cart, which should travel down this path, into the next room, where the fish net will fall on them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wow, cool!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Munky|Hey! Somebody\'s coming. \'\'[everyone jumps back behind some boxes]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Secure Group|Aaaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'ve got to hide!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Hey, there\'s Antonio Banderas! He\'ll help us. \'\'[calls out]\'\' Mr. Banderas!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|\'\'[peeks up]\'\' Jonathan, no!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Secure group|\'\'[hits the slick]\'\' Aaaah! \'\'[the trap works exactly as David said it would]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Head|Oh, no!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Secure group|Aaaah! \'\'[the cart hits the wall and stops. The insecure group rushes in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|Hold on, guys! \'\'[the lynch mob, led by the watchmen, bursts through the doors and moves in on the group]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brunet|Alright, KoRn, time for you to get out of town! \'\'[the pirate ghosts appear]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pirate Ghosts|Aarrrrgh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|\'\'[frightened]\'\' Aaaaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|KoRn is sending their demon minions upon us!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|\'\'[shrieking]\'\' Aaaaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|\'\'[to his band mates]\'\' Alright, gang.

CORN! \'\'[final starbursts give way to various corn products: two corncobs, a tub of popcorn, a can of creamed corn, and one corn kernel. The tub of popcorn swells and spits out several popped kernels. The townsfolk just stare and the corn products stay still. The pirates are seen staring. Soon, the products revert to the band mates]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Alright! Great job, gang! \'\'[The townsfolk stare]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That didn\'t help at all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Head|We know.

You trapped them!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|\'\'[approaches the net]\'\' Yeah.

Arrest that band!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|Oh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|No! Arrest him!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mob|Huh??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|I think \'\'I\'ve\'\' got this groovy mystery solved!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside. The mystery has apparently been explained. The priest is now under arrest}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, I must say I still don\'t get this at all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|It\'s simple. Priest Maxi didn\'t want there to be a Halloween, so he decided to scare everyone away from the docks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|David|Yeah. And then he used this flashlight and some cotton swabs to create the ghosts. \'\'[shows the flashlight and swabs, then shines the light through the swabs. The pirate ghosts appear in the distance]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fieldy|\'\'[with some cheese and a cup]\'\' Then all he needed was some sound effects created by this cup and a piece of cheese. \'\'[holds them to his mouth and sounds]\'\' Aaaaraargh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|And all he had to do then was create a ghost ship, by using some candles, a mirror, and two squirrels. \'\'[genuflects to place the candle between the mirror and the squirrels. A pirate ship appears on the lake]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Father, why did you go to all this trouble?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Priest Maxi|Because Halloween is an abomination of God. I would do anything to stop this wretched, unholy holiday!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Including killing people and wreaking havoc all over South Park?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brunet|Don\'t you see that by trying to stop Halloween you\'ve scared the hell out of everybody?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Priest Maxi|No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Barbrady|Okay buddy, you can explain downtown! \'\'[takes the priest away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Well, this is all fine and good, but it doesn\'t explain what happened to my mother\'s body!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah! Where\'s Grandma? \'\'[the dog walks in and begins regurgitating. First, the head comes out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mob|Eeewww! \'\'[the rest of the body comes out]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|There she is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mob|Oooh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Ho-hoh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well thanks a lot, KoRn!

Why the heck not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mob|All right! \'\'[the pirate cutout is hoisted up on two poles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pirate Voice|Raarrrr!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, no!

KoRn is preparing for their concert. The mob is spread out in front of the stage. Jonathan takes the mic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|Well, this sure has been a wacky night, but me and the gang learned a lot, and we hope you did too. You all perceived us to be mean, evil people, but, really, we\'re just normal guys. And we all perceived pirate ghosts to be real when, actually, they were just cotton swabs. So I guess the lesson is: it\'s easy to perceive somethin\' someway, and then be wrong. So we all need to learn to be a little less perceptive.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|All|\'\'[reflecting]\'\' Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonathan|The gang and I wrote a song about it, and it goes goes a little somethin\' like this:<br />And a-one, and-a-two, and a \'\'[goes right into "Falling Away From Me."
