Now, Timmy, I\'m going to read you a book called, "The Great Gatsby," by F. Scott Fitzgerald. At the end of the novel I\'ll ask you a few questions.

Kenny bangs his head against the wall cabinet. Tweek, Kyle, and Bebe sleep where they sit. Cartman is asleep on his back.

They play, but don\'t sing, and thrust their heads down from time to time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Drummer|Dude, we suck!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skyler|Hey, that\'s not the right attitude, Jonesy! The Battle of the Bands is tomorrow night!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jonesy|Dude, we \'\'never\'\' win the Battle of the Bands! It\'s no big deal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skyler|\'\'[disbelieving]\'\' Not a big deal!

A hundred dollars\' worth of Ritalin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|And he won\'t have Attention Deficit Disorder anymore?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|We can only hope so.

I should have known. It all makes sense now. I could never get Stanley to pay attention when his grandfather told him stories about the \'30s.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|I know what you mean.

People laughed at Timmy, and Timmy should be at home, where he\'s protected from laughter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I agree. You know what, you guys? We should go to the concert anyways and see Phil Collins.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. I think Phil Collins rocks the house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sounds good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So it\'s decided: Phil Collins concert for all of us. \'\'[a Christina Aguilera bug is crawling all over Kenny]\'\' Hooray. \'\'[looks]\'\' Oh oh. Hold still, Kenny. \'\'[takes his pan and swings it at Kenny. It strikes, and Kenny\'s face is smashed in. Kenny falls forward, hits the floor, and a puddle of blood forms under him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my goodness, you killed Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Bastard.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house. Several parents are gathered in the living room. Chef speaks}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Parents, I called you all together because I think you might be making a mistake puttin\' your children on Ritalin. \'\'[Along with Stan\'s parents, Kyle\'s parents, Tweek\'s parents, Liane Cartman, Craig\'s parents, and another set of parents are present]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Uh, but our kids have Attention Deficit Disorder, Chef. They can\'t pay attention in school without it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I know you wanna help your kids, but I brought over a videotape to show you that there are alternative\' to Ritalin. There\'s this doctor in Northern California who is doin\' real amazing things with kids who have ADD. I want you to watch this tape. \'\'[puts in the tape. The VCR does the rest]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Shay|Hello, I\'m Dr. Richard Shay, here to tell you about my exciting new drug-free treatment for children with Attention Deficit Disorder. \'\'[three kids are in a classroom setting, acting up. Dr. Shay enters]\'\' This treatment is fast and effective and doesn\'t use harmful drugs. Watch closely as I apply treatment to the first child.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girl|\'\'[Dr. Shay walks up to her and listens as she rattles off]\'\' I want a horse. I want a big brown horse with a brown-and-black tail, and a diamond tiara- \'\'[he smacks her behind the ear]\'\' Ah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Shay|Sit down and study! \'\'[she looks at him scared, then picks up a book and opens it, looking at him all the while. He moves on to the boy in the middle desk]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 1|Woohoo, let\'s go sledding, let\'s go race and race, let\'s go! \'\'[Dr. Shay smacks him too, making him turn aside. He turns back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Shay|Sit down and study!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy 1|\'\'[looks at him, then starts crying]\'\' Wwaaahahahahaaha \'\'[Dr. Shay smacks him again. The other boy stops and looks]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Shay|Stop crying and do your schoolwork! \'\'[the boy opens his book. He and the girl start reading. The Dr. moves over to the other boy, and he just cracks open his book and reads. The doctor address the camera]\'\' If you would like more information on my bold new treatments, please send away for this free brochure, entitled, "You can either calm down, or I can pop you in the mouth again." Thank you. \'\'[Chef turns the tape off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, what do you think? I can have Dr. Shay come to South Park for a small fee.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|That video had pretty colors.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|It sure did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|What the...? Dammit! Have you all been taking your children\'s Ritalin too?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Parents|Yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Awww, fudge it! \'\'[throws the remote aside. The boys enter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Chef, are you going to the Phil Collins concert tomorrow?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|The what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Phil Collins is playing Lalapalala\'s, and because we\'re all doing so well in school now, our parents said they would take us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Parents|Yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Hold on a second: you children \'\'want\'\' to go see Phil Collins?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yes. His flowing melodies are really enjoyable to us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Oh my God!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Come, see him with us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, come with us. Come with uusss. Haaa, it\'s Christina Aguilera again! \'\'[runs around]\'\' She\'s on my back! Hah! \'\'[leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|That does it! That Ritalin has affected your little cracker brains too deeply! I\'m going to go see that damn pharmacist!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Pharmacy, after hours. The pharmacist and the clinic doctor are talking, and the doctor counts some money}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|Look at that. Ritalin stocks are up ten points.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|That\'s easily another twenty grand apiece! \'\'[the pharmacist laughs and Chef arrives]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|\'\'[pounds on the door]\'\' Hey, open this damn door. \'\'[the doctor and pharmacist cover the money and go to the front door.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|Can I help you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Yes you can! What the hell are you two doin\' prescribing all the children Ritalin?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|Well, they\'ve all been diagnosed with ADD. That\'s Attention Deficit-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|I know what it is! But now you\'ve got a town full of zombie children from the planet Zandor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|All around the country, you bastard doctors are giving children Ritalin! And for every one child that actually needs it, you give it to 50,000 that don\'t!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|Hey now, don\'t tell us our business, Mr. Chef. Why, we-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|You\'re damn right I\'ll tell you yo\' business, because you two have got your heads up your asses! Thanks to you, we have children in our town that like Phil Collins!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|Eh wuh, what?? \'\'[he and the doctor are shocked]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|That\'s right! You\'ve made them so dull and boring that they\'re actually going to go to a Phil Collins concert!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|Mm- my God. What have we done?? \'\'[beings to weep]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|Well, if I had known... Phil Collins, uh, my God! \'\'[beings to weep as well]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, how do we reverse the Ritalin?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|We uh... have to convince them not to take it, but, ahah ih it\'ll be hard to get it away from them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Then we need an antidote!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|Yes, of course.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clinic doctor|Uh, what\'s the antidote for Ritalin?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pharmacist|I have some right here. \'\'[takes a bottle from a medicine case]\'\' It\'s a compound called "Ritalout."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Alright.

Free drinks on me. \'\'[Kyle reaches for his drink and takes a sip]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, thank you, Chef. How nice. \'\'[takes a glass. He and Kyle drink at the same time as Chef leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Phil Collins|I know. I\'d like to sing the complex and amazing song that won me the Oscar, a song entitled, <poem><i>"You\'ll Be In... Me." \'\'[goes to the piano, sets the Oscar on the piano top and starts playing it]\'\' Thanks. You\'re inside of me. Deep inside of me. \'\'[Chef hands drinks to more kids]\'\' So deep inside, I can feel you pushing against my heart.</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Come on, drink it down.

Yeah, sure, we laughed at Timmy, but what\'s wrong with laughter? Just because we laugh at something doesn\'t mean we don\'t care about it. Timmy made us smile, and playing made Timmy smile, so where was the harm in that? The people that are wrong are the ones that think people like Timmy should be "protected" and kept out of the public\'s eye. The cool thing about Timmy being in a band was that he was in your face, and you \'\'had\'\' to deal with him, whether you laughed or cried, or felt nothing.
