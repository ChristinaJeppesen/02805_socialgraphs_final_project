It was during that great battle that ninja master Kenny threw his star into Professor Chaos\' eye. Now the ninjas were in serious trouble, because their parents might find out they had weapons, if Professor Chaos told on them. While trying to get Professor Chaos some aid at the veterinarian\'s office, the four ninjas ran into Craig and his three friends. They challenged the four ninjas to fight, and the legendary battle of Tokutawa began. It was during this battle that Professor Chaos escaped, and so the four ninjas were forced to join forces with Craig and his friends to find Professor Chaos, or else they would all be grounded.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Here, Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Butters!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Butters!
