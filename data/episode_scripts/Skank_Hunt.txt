We need every parent to look for the signs in their own child.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He changes PowerPoint to a slide titled \'Signs That my Child is a Troll\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Schroeder|In order for us to find these secretive monsters, we need all parents to ask themselves: "Could my child be a troll?".}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sheila and Gerald\'s car, at night and after the PTA meeting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|My God, what children are capable of now. What kind of hate would have to be in that child\'s heart?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Well, you never know, could be someone who just, kind of thinks it\'s funny to stir the pot and watch everyone freak out. \'\'[Sheila gives Gerald a questioning look]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Uh, you know! Maybe the fact that it\'s so not funny makes it somehow funny, to kids? Gosh, I-I certainly don\'t understand it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A bridge over a river, snowing. The same picture is reposted by Butters on Twitter, and Heidi looks at it on her phone sadly. Heidi then slowly walks to the side edge of the bridge.
