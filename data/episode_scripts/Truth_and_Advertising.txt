\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, Fourth Grade, day. The new teacher, Mrs. Nelson is writing out a lesson on adverbial clauses on the chalkboard}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Nelson|Alright guys, now let\'s go back and talk about infinitives \'\'[begins writing the lesson on that subject]\'\'. Remember, those are verbs combined with the work "to."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[yawns and whispers to Kyle]\'\' Oh, my fucking God...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Nelson|Now, usually an infinitive acts like a noun, as in "I want TO go out to eat" or \'\'[Cartman tugs on Kyle\'s pen, making him mess up, and smiles. Kyle pulls the pen away.

Is there a problem, guys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Go get my pen, fatass}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I am not your slave, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Go get my pen!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[over the PA system]\'\' Attention, students.

He and his PC buddies are on a hunger strike and, they\'re calling for people\'s resignations. Kyle, PC Principal had problems with Jimmy and with Leslie. And now they\'re missing. M\'kay?

First, programming code appears onscreen, then Jimmy}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|For years, mankind has tried to rid the world of ads. For our ancestors, ads couldn\'t be avoided. But everyone knew what was an ad, and what wasn\'t. After many years, mankind invented cable. A way to p-pay for television so there would be no ads. But somehow, the ads still found a way. And so mankind invented TiVo. A way to skip past commercials. Finally, it appeared to be the end of ads. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads were stopped. Or so it seemed. With the rise of the Internet, suddenly the ads got an en- tirely new way to attack us. Popups. The top scientific minds were brought together to find a way to stop the ads, once and for all. They invented the ad blocker. Suddenly there were no ads on phones, on computers. And everywhere, people rejoiced. The ads adapted. They became s-smarter. They disguised themselves as news. All around the world people read news stories completely unaware that they were reading ads . And now, the ads have taken the next step in their evolution. They have taken human form. Ads are among us. They could be your friend, your g-gardener. The ads are trying to wipe us out. But the question is... how?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, dinner. All the family is there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|So, um, ahem, South Park kind of sucks now.

You know, we don\'t have to live here, we can live anywhere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Last month, all you could talk about was how great this town had become.

It isn\'t my fault! It\'s the Man. Don\'t you see? The Man... is pricing us out of our own town.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The newsmen\'s headquarters. Leslie is in the interrogation room, while Jimmy looks in from the meeting room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|\'\'[faces the newsmen]\'\' It\'s just my luck. I talk to a nice girl, seem to hit it off, and she turns out to just be an ad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|Well, that\'s what an ad does. She was designed to entice, and manipulate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|This is such a fantastic story for the school newspaper. Why don\'t we just run it so that everyone knows the truth?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|Jimmy, we\'re newsmen, like you. For decades we used our soft buttery voices to inform the people about what\'s happening. Then we watched as our entire industry was taken over by the ads. \'\'[the newsman to his right lowers his head and looks at the table]\'\' Some of our colleagues were manipulated into doing the ads\' bidding. The man who came to your house with a gun was one of them. Our own Kevin Jarvis has more.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kevin|Thanks, Tom. Jimmy, the man who tried to kill you was Brian Boint, of WXNR, Fort Collins. When he saw there was no money in news anymore he sided with the ads, even though he knew it meant the destruction of our species. Back to you, Tom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|Thanks, Kevin. The only hope for the truth to get out there, Jimmy, is for you to see through this ad\'s deception and to find out what they\'re planning. Your Super School News was a threat to them. But unless you get this little bitch to talk, we may never know why.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, hallway, day. Kenny and Stan walk into view, spot Kyle, and walk over to him.

Caitlyn, Principal Victoria, and Mr. Garrison have arrived and park on the side of the road to look at the town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|We have to make sure nobody recognizes us.

Let\'s not forget that Stan\'s dad is PC Principal\'s little bitch!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wuh huh, that\'s a good point.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I am loving this right now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|My dad\'s stupid, not a bitch! This is about you being scared, Kyle!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It is you, isn\'t it?! That\'s why you\'re trying to shift the blame on me. That\'s very Cartman of you, Stan!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hoh that\'s low. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t you dare call me a Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|N-ho, that\'s good!

We can\'t just go walking in there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|Why not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|This is a safe space. We\'re not allowed past this. When you breach a college safe space, you\'re crossing the most sacred human boundary there is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Caitlyn|J\'hoh, give me a break.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Nonononono, look, this is very real, and very important in PC culture. Every human has a right to a safe space and it cannot be entered.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Garrison|\'\'[determined]\'\' I can. Watch. \'\'[lifts up the PC tape and walks under and on to the house]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Wow, how did you-? \'\'[Principal Victoria and Caitlyn Jenner do the same]\'\' Whoa.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school newsroom, day.

What have you done to the Super School News?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nathan|I was just holding down the fort while you were away, Jim.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Writing headlines sponsored by PC Principal and the ads? How much did they pay you?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nathan|Please, Jimmy, I\'m just trying to survive here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Everyone\'s gonna know the truth, Nathan. We\'re getting a new edition of the school paper out by morning. Everyone\'s gonna know all about the ads. \'\'[Leslie punches him and he goes flying into a bookcase.
