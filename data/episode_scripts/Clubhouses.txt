She looks very pretty.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Stan, can I talk to you for a second?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Wendy takes his hand and pulls him aside.

Oh, you got me, Terrance!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Terrance|Yes, I sure did!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy laughs some more.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Whoa, dude. Your dad is watching \'\'Terrance and Phillip\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|No, I was just uh flipping through the channels.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He starts changing the channels.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey, Dad, we need to build a clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|How do we do it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Uh, you just get a hammer and some wood.

Cartman and Kenny are looking over the clubhouse kit Cartman has apparently ordered: The Ewok Village 2000 Deluxe Club House Kit w/Elevator. It has a two-story design.

You have to be the worker.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|\'\'[Still trying.]\'\' (Uh--)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|\'\'[Stopping by.]\'\' How\'s the treehouse coming along, hon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mom, it\'s not a treehouse, it\'s a clubhouse!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Sorry, hon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mom? Can we pull up the carpeting in the living room?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Well, I don\'t know, Eric. If you did that, then the floors would be bare.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Sliding into a whine.]\'\' But Mmmom, the blueprint says we need carpeting in the clubhouse!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Well, all right.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kenny, my mom says you can go get carpeting in the living room now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(You suck ass and you suck dick!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny walks off to get the carpeting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|And stop your bitchin\'!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s House, Stan enters the kitchen and reaches for a jar as his mom washes dishes. She\'s upset.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|What are you doing, sweetheart?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Getting a cookie. We\'re building a clubhouse and then we\'re--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|You men are all alike. First you get a cookie and then you criticize the way I dress and then it\'s the way I cook! I suppose next you\'ll be telling me that you need your space and that I\'m sabotaging your creativity. Go ahead, Stanley, get your God-damned cookie!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She walks off in a huff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'Kay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary. Class is now in session. Mr. Twig is still there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|And so, children, today we\'re gonna focus on American history, right Mr. Twig?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Twig|Uh- that\'s right, Mr. Garrison. American history is very important--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|When is Mr. Hat coming back?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|What did you say?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|When is Mr. Hat coming back?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|I told you to never mention that name in my classroom again!

Are you paying attention?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yes, Mr. Garrison.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Well, then, Stanley. What did I just say?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan| Um. You said that even though- Charo appeared twelve times on the \'\'Love Boat\'\', the episode with Captain and Tennille got higher ratings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|...Well, okay. I suppose you were paying attention.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Garrison turns to write on the blackboard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Anyway, children, the Love Boat did go on for about eight years. They tried to bring it back recently, but it didn\'t work. Probably \'cause Robert Urich had to weigh...}}\n{{ScriptScene|While he\'s explaining the mediocrity of \'\'The Love Boat: The Next Wave\'\', the following takes place.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Good guess, dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Phew.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bebe writes a note and then hands it to Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Pssst! Pass this up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters hands along the note to Kevin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Pass this up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kevin hands along the note to Fosse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kevin|Pass this up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fosse hands along the note to Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fosse|P-huh pass this h-up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan gets the note and reads it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Stanley, are you passing notes to Kyle?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, I just--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Don\'t lie, Stan. Lying makes you sterile.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m not lying. Someone just handed me the--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Stanley, if you think it\'s so important to keep interrupting my class, then why don\'t you come up to the front and read your note to Kyle for everyone to hear!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But I didn\'t write the note!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mr. Garrison, Stan\'s behavior is having an adverse effect on my education.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Shut up, Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Stanley Marsh, you come up here right now and read your note!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, man.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bebe is worried, as Stan goes up to the front of the class to read the note.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|<poem>\nDear Kyle.\nYou have got such a great ass.\nI could sleep for days on those perked cheeks, let me tell you.\n I\'d like to live with you and wear your ass as a hat for all eternity.</poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|The entire class stares at Stan in shock.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whoa, dude!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Mr. Mackey\'s office. Stan and Mr. Mackey are talking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Now, young man, uh- school is a time for learning, m\'kay? Not for immature skylarkings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What\'s \'skylarkings\'?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|You know, like tomfooleries.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Who?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Someone knocks on Mr. Mackey\'s door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Oh, your parents are here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, no.}}\n{{ScriptScene|They enter and stand behind Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Thank you for coming on such short notice.

Skylarkings?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Yeahm\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy, let me handle this. Now Stanley, I want you to explain to me why you were passing notes in school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It wasn\'t my note, dude. It was some girl\'s.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Okay. Stanley, we\'re all here to get to the root of your behavior disorder.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|You really should know better, Stanley.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|You need to shape up, mister.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[To Randy.]\'\' Don\'t interrupt me! You always interrupt me when I talk! Can\'t you see that I--?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[A bit testily.]\'\' I don\'t interrupt you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|There, you did it again! \'\'[To Mr. Mackey.]\'\' He interrupted me again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Okay, uh-- Perhaps you should let your wife finish talking, Mr. Marsh. Now, Stan, I want to you to be--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Okay, I\'m sorry I interrupt. But she always takes over any conversation!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Uh. U-uh, taking over any conversation\'s bad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[To Randy.]\'\' Like you\'re one to talk! When\'s the last time you really listened to what I had to say?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|\'\'[Slowly.]\'\' Uuuhh. Mmm mkay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|When was the last time you had anything interesting to say? It\'s always gossip and stupid crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Okay uh uh uh-apparently we have a bit of a communication problem here. Uh, Mr. Marsh, tell me how you\'re feeling.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well- uh, I feel like everything I do is wrong, it doesn\'t matter what I say.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Mkay. That\'s valid. Now, uh, Mrs. Marsh--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Excuse me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey| -how do you feel?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Like I\'m a ghost. Like he sees right through me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh, please!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Oh, please yourself!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Who tries to control the marriage?

Now all we need is chicks, Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right. You go find chicks, Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Well, why do I have to be the one to go and find chicks?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Because I have to stay here and work! I still have to shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kinds of inspections. I\'ve got way too much to do, and all you have to do is to go find chicks! Now, stop your bitchin\'!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny walks off and Cartman watches him leave. As soon as he\'s gone, Cartman throws off his hat and runs into the house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mom, can I watch \'\'American Gladiators\'\'?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s Backyard, Kyle is on the clubhouse floor, waiting as Stan climbs up the steps.

Do you know how to play Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well dude, how the hell are we supposed to play it, then?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I didn\'t even think about that.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Later, at Chef\'s house. Candles line his dining room wall, and he and Stan are sitting at his table.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|And then, they\'ll ask, "Truth or Dare?\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|And I say, "Dare!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|No no! You say, "Truth."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|"Truth?" But that\'s boring! I want to get "Dare" to kiss her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|You have to say "Truth" the first few times. Or else, you seem too eager.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oooh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|You can\'t seem too eager. You\'ve got to play it cool, like you don\'t even care what happens.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Then, after a few "Truth"s, you finally answer, "Dare."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|"Dare!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|But not like that, son. Like this: "\'\'Daaare\'\'".}}\n{{ScriptScene|Chef speaks in a low, senusal voice, as he moves his hand through the air in unison, for effect.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oooh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|And then her little friend will dare you to kiss Wendy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You really think so?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Of course she will. They\'re women. They\'ve had this whole thing planned out months ahead of time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Meanwhile, over at Cartman\'s house.

I have taken you under my wing and done my best, and all you ever do is whine and moan about it! Now, for the last time, go cut some firewood!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Roy walks off.

Meanwhile, back at Cartman\'s house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|So, I\'m on my way out the door, and she goes, "Make sure you\'re home before midnight!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ahaw, that\'s weak.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|And I go, "Listen, bitch! I don\'t need my mother giving me no curfew!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s killer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|And she goes, "Yeah, well, if you\'re not home before midnight, don\'t bother coming home at all!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s totally weak!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|So I go, "Fine! I won\'t come home!"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sweet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|And then she goes, "Fine! Don\'t come home!", getting all up in my face and crap and acting all tough and crap.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Killer weak, sweet!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|I\'m sixteen. I should be able to do what I want when I want.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman listens intently.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|I don\'t need her breathing down my neck every two seconds telling me what I can and cannot do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I had the same thing with my mom the other day. I\'m all like, "Ey! I am not a little kid anymore! Ma, I\'m eight years old! And if I wanna fingerpaint, then I\'m gonna fingerpaint!"}}\n{{ScriptScene|The girls just look at him. Back at Stan\'s house, Stan and Kyle are putting the finishing touches on their clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay. We\'re done.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[Wiggling the railing.]\'\' Dude, I don\'t think this is very sturdy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A piece of it comes off in his hand and falls to the ground, where it breaks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It doesn\'t matter, dude. It only has to last long enough to play Truth or Dare. I\'m gonna go get the girls.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan climbs down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan is humming as he is going away, but his is stopped by a pair of legs, he looks up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|G\'oh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley, it\'s time to go!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Go where?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Your bastard father has visitation rights, and this is his time with you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But no! I have to get the girls to come-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Come on, Stanley!}}\n{{ScriptScene|She takes him away by the hand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Weak!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A car is heard pulling up. It\'s Randy, in a red Corvette.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hey, Stanley, uh, hop in.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan gets in, and they peel off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Listen, Stanley, I- I know all this change must be tough on you, but you know, your-your mother and I thought it\'d be best for all of us if we\'d split up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But I don\'t understand why we have to--}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy pulls up and stops next to a pink Jeep.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, hello, ladies.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1 Passenger|Hi, handsome. We\'re gonna be at Larry\'s Bar tonight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[Suavely.]\'\' I\'m already there.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She winks at him and the ladies peel off. Randy turns to Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What were we talking about? Oh yeah. See, your mother and I still care about you and your sister. But we just don\'t like being around each other any more.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I don\'t like being around my sister anymore; does that mean I can leave her, too?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, no, because you\'re a family. You just can\'t leave family; you have to stick with family, no matter what.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But you and Mom are family; how come you can just split up?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy is stumped.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You know what I think? I think that when you and Mom got married, you became family. And now that you are, you shouldn\'t be able to leave her anymore than I can leave my sister.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hoho, Stan, you\'re so young. You just don\'t get it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy pulls back up at Stan\'s house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, anyway, have a nice day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What? That\'s it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah. But I loved our time together. I hate to see it end. Go on, get out.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan gets out of the car.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|You know that nothing is more important to me than you, right, Stan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I guess, but--}}\n{{ScriptScene|Before Stan can finish, Randy drives off, Stan just watches, speechless. Moments later, he is inside his clubhouse with Kyle, they are looking out the window in anticipation of Wendy and Bebe coming over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, dude, the girls are gonna be here to play Truth or Dare any minute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stan, if I didn\'t know you better, I would almost think you\'re doing this because you wanna play with girls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No way, dude! Don\'t be silly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[Off screen.]\'\' Come on, Wendy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We have to say "Truth" a couple of times before we say "Dare," right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Right. Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Because if we don\'t, we\'ll seem too eager.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Too eager to what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|To say "Dare," dumbass! Jeez.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[Entering the clubhouse.]\'\' Hi, guys.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys are startled, but turn around.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, hi Wendy. What\'s up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Don\'t you guys still wanna play "Truth or Dare"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah! I mean, sure, whatever.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Then come on!}}\n{{ScriptScene|They all sit, Wendy across from Stan, Bebe across from Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[To Kyle, softly.]\'\' Remember, "Truth" the first couple of times.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Who wants to go first?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|I will. Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Umm. Dare?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan looks at him angrily, then punches him on the arm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[Whispers.]\'\' How about we give him Bebe?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[Whispers.]\'\' Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|\'\'[Whispers.]\'\' Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[Whispers.]\'\' Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Kiss Bebe on the lips!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?!! Sick, dude, I\'m not kissing a girl!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|What\'s the matter, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s just wrong, that\'s all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t be a chicken, dude. Just close your eyes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What the hell have you gotten me into?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, Cartman is in his clubhouse playing Truth or Dare with girls right now. You really want him to beat us?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle thinks for a moment then looks at Bebe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hoh boy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle puckers up, Bebe comes and gives him a peck on the lips.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sick!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He gets up and rushes to the entrance.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Aggghhh! Fucking sickening!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle shimmies on down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[Staring at him as he leaves.]\'\' Wow, look at that ass! Shake it, baby!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Your turn, Bebe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[Seated back by Wendy.]\'\' Okay, Stan. Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan takes a moment to look at Wendy, then at her lips.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Stan, Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[Sensually.]\'\' Dare.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Before Bebe can respond and bring Stan to Wendy\'s sweet lips, Roy pops in, ruining everything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Son, could you please help me with the firewood?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...Dude, we cut firewood all day yesterday! We have enough to last twelve years!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|When will you let me in? Let me love you?! Now, get your ass out here and help me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Bye, Stan. Hopefully we can play Truth or Dare tomorrow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Crap!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Over at Cartman\'s clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|I think you should be able to move out legally when you\'re fourteen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 2|\'\'[Pulls out a cigarette.]\'\' Our moms won\'t even let us smoke.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|Yeah, it\'s my body. My mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it\'s my body. I should be able to do whatever I want with it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Totally. Uuuuuh my mom gives me shit sometimes, and I tell her to shut her hole before I kick her in the nuts!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Just then, Liane calls up to him and he freezes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Eric, snookums! it\'s time for Mommy to tuck you into your snuggleboat for night-night.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He\'s clearly alarmed now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Eric, are you out there in your clubhouse?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Voice shaking.]\'\' Coming, Mom. \'\'[To the girls.]\'\' Okay, we have to play Truth or Dare, quick!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guy in leather jacket|Hey, girls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guy with long hair|What\'s up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|Oh hey, Scott.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Who the hell are you?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 2|Uh- we invited some people over. Hope you don\'t mind.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|How many people?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bus stop, next day. Kyle is alone, and Bebe walks up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Kyle, can I talk to you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Kyle, this is very difficult for me. I think we need time apart.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|I\'m just feeling really trapped. I can\'t go on with this codependency.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay, that\'s fine.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bebe covers Kyle\'s mouth with her mitten.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|No, no. Don\'t speak. Just try and understand. It has to be this way.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[Muffled.]\'\' But I don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Please. Just remember the good times we had. I\'ll never forget you. Never.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She walks over to love interest.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Okay, Clyde, we can go now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Bitchin\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Clyde walks off after her. Back at Stan\'s house, Roy is watching a home decorating show. Stan comes in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Host|These are café curtains that require no sewing, and I know you all love that!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A smattering of applause. Not many audience members.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Do you mind if I watch cartoons? I\'ve had a rough day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Nnuuhunuuhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Chores. Do chores.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|My dad lets me watch cartoons.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Well I\'m not your dad. Okay? I\'m \'\'not\'\' your dad! You- you can\'t just go around playing games with my emotions.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Roy starts weeping and walks away as Sharon approaches.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[Arms on her hips.]\'\' Stanley, what did you do to Roy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Roy\'s a dick! He ruined my chances with Wendy in the clubhouse!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[Sighs.]\'\' Stanley, you know you\'re the most important thing to me, right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|If that\'s true, then get back together with Dad for me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Now Stanley, you have to understand how divorce works. When I say, "you\'re the most important thing to me," what I mean is, you\'re the most important thing after me and my happiness and my new romances.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Bye now. Roy!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sharon goes after him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Divorce is stupid.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan clicks on the TV, and "Fat Abbot" comes on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fat Abbot|Heeyy heeyy heeyy! Hey Yolanda. Why is your eye all black and blue and shit?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yolanda|Maaan, Fat Abbot. My stepdad popped me in my eye.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fat Abbot|Stepdad? You gotta off his ass!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yolanda|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fat Abbot|Yeah, bitch! Snatch his ass in a bear trap! Leave that motherfucker swingin\' from a tree so high nobody finds him for days! Glock-glock, you know what I\'m sayin\'? Dumbassed motherfucker pullin\' shit! Damn!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yolanda|You\'re right, Fat Abbot. Thanks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Fat Abbot|No problem, ho. Maybe later you can suck my dick, bitch-ho! Shit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|Well, Fat Abbot and the gang sure done learned somethin\' today. If you have a stepdad ridin\' your ass, just snatch his ass in a bear trap. Grine! No more stepdad. See ya next time eatin\' the pudding.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. Yeah, I think I\'ll write a little note for Roy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan grabs paper and pencil and starts writing. That night, over at Cartman\'s clubhouse, the place is jumping, music is blaring, and a small crowd mills around. The long-haired teenager stands next to the radio for a moment, then passes out. Cartman brings a tray holding a box and bowl of Cheesy Poofs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Older kid|Hey, kid, give me some of those!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Holding a beer bottle, he grabs some Cheesy Poofs and swallows them.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman fights through the crowd to the teenage girls Kenny found.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey! When are we gonna play Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Runaway girl 1|What? That game\'s for kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|This is bullcrap!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman throws up the tray and lets it fly everywhere, Randy, who is also at Cartman\'s clubhouse party is hanging out near a girl dancing in overalls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh boy, it\'s getting late. I\'m gonna have to leave this party.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|This sucks, Kenny! I wish we\'d never built a clubhouse!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The music begins to build.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Punk|\'\'\'\'\'Mosh pit!\'\'\'\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny stands alone in an open space in the crowd.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Huh?)}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd rushes to fill it in and stomps all over him, then disperses, revealing rats feasting on his corpse. The lyrics appropriately say, "Why don\'t you just pull a piece of me? Why catch some piece of me? Why does everybody want a piece of me?"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my God, they killed Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside on the street in front of Cartman\'s house, Kyle happens to be passing by.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You bastard!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Over at Stan\'s house. Sharon shouts for Stan to hear if he is home.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley?! Your father is coming over for visitation! Stan?}}\n{{ScriptScene|She sees the note he has written, which reads: Meet me in the clubhouse. She tosses the note onto the sofa and walks out. Roy enters the living room after she has left.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Sharon? Sharon, have you seen my copy of \'\'Harper\'s?\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Roy sees the note and reads it aloud.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Meet me at the clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Out inside Stan\'s clubhouse, Randy is sitting alone, Sharon climbs up and parts the curtain behind him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Oh, Randy. What are you doing here?}}\n{{ScriptScene|She climbs in and sits near him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I, uh, got a note from Stanley to come out to the-uh clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Oh I thought that note was for me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh, maybe it was.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sharon looks around, surveying Stan and Kyle\'s handiwork.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Well, it looks like our little Stanley has built himself quite a clubhouse here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I remember not too long ago we were just kids playing kissing games in my clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A moment of awkward silence, then Sharon gets up and goes to leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Goodnight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Sharon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Yes?}}\n{{ScriptScene|She turns back to face him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|It\'s too late for games.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She comes back in and sits down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|No, I\'m serious, please. Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Truth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Do you still love me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Oh, Randy, I do love you, but- now I\'m so confused-uh. I\'m living with Roy and-, I don\'t know how to break it off with him.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Roy exits the house looking for Sharon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Sharon--}}\n{{ScriptScene|Roy springs a trap.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Guh-ow! Uh. Ey! Uh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, you never know. Maybe--}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|He-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy| --thing will work out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Maybe. I guess it\'s my turn. Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Sharon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[Sensually.]\'\' Dare.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Do me. Right here in the clubhouse.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy pounces on her and they go at it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Hello? Hel-lo? Could- could somebody get me d-? Hello?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan is holding the rope to the trap.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow. Clubhouses are magical.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The next day back at the clubhouse, Stan, Wendy, Bebe, and Clyde are there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Okay. It\'s my turn. Stan? Truth or Dare?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan is nervous, sweating, but willing. He looks at Wendy then at her lips.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dare.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Wendy and Bebe whisper.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Take this stick and jam it up your peehole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Wow, that sucks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Do you think it\'ll hurt?}}\n{{ScriptScene|End of \'\'\'Clubhouses\'\'\', Roy is still dangling from the tree outside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Roy|Hello? I sure am hungry. Anybody? It certainly does suck right here. Hello? Shuh- Sharon? Sharon, hello?}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia02|episode=12}}\n[[zh:疯狂俱乐部/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Two]]'}]}}}}
