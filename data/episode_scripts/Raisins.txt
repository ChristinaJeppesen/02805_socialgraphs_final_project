\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary playground, recess or lunch. The camera pans across the playground and settles on two teams of seven players each.

The second includes Craig, Tweek, Kevin, Pip, and three others}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|All right, you guys, it\'s first down. I\'ll hike the ball on the third "set hut!"

A montage begins.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan is next seen walking onto a small red stone bridge. The next scene has him walking down the middle of a two-lane road in the rain. He stops to take in the moist air. The next scene has him back on the bridge, looking over the creek with his head on his right hand. On the water he sees a reflection of Wendy walk up to him. She\'s smiling. He brightens as she approaches. He turns to greet her, but there\'s no one to greet. He looks back at the creek, then turns around and walks off. The next scene has him at a rainy night sitting on the curb in a run-down part of town, under a working street light, with his face buried in his legs, crying. The last scene has him in his room, sitting on the floor by his bed, looking at a picture of Wendy. He gently strokes the picture, which has Wendy holding a daisy and smiling broadly. On the picture are written the words "I love you forever. Wendy." The image fades to black}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. In the hallway Craig goes to a drinking fountain for a drink of water. Fosse and Dog Poo walk towards the camera. Stan is at the far end watching Wendy open her locker.

I just don\'t wanna be boyfriend and girlfriend anymore. I\'ve been wanting to break up for a while. but it\'s, it\'s nothing against him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'Kay. \'\'[walks back to Stan, but avoids looking at him, as well]\'\' She says she\'s been wantin\' to break up for a while, and it\'s nothing against you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?

He\'s next seen in bed, a blanket hung across his window blocking out the outside light. He has his sheets drawn up tight against his chin. A few moments later, Kyle enters with Butters, Cartman, Jimmy and Kenny.

I used to have a hat juuust like that, except, it was black and it didn\'t have a puffball on it. Oh my God, my hands are sooo cold. How come people have hands, anyway? Did you ever wonder that? \'\'[Stan looks more and more miserable with every word coming out of her mouth.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Some time later, still dining.

Stan stands on the lawn with a boombox, looking up at Wendy\'s window. He presses the play button and holds up the boombox. Peter Gabriel\'s "Shock the Monkey" plays from somewhere in the middle. Wendy appears at the window and looks down, her jaw dropping. Stan holds the boombox higher, keeping Wendy\'s gaze on him. Wendy covers her mouth as Tolkien appears next to her at the window. Stan\'s jaw drops. Wendy leaves the window. Tolkien unleashes the curtain ties, and the curtains close upon the window}}\n{{ScriptScene|Raisins, night, outside. The outside lights turn off. Butters waits outside on the curb with a present. The front door opens and Lexus appears. Butters rises to greet her}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lexus|Okay, Porsche, see you tomorrow.

If you come within five feet of a customer, you need to acknowledge them, even if they\'re not at your table. "Hey,  cutie." \'\'[waves and winks]\'\' When you\'re not serving food or talking with customers, you need to dance around and have fun. \'\'[they stop by a wooden bucket]\'\' We use things like Hula Hoops, silly strings, and water guns to play with the other girls. Be sure to giggle a lot, and be sure to show off your raisins. \'\'[they leave the bucket]\'\' Now, when you take a customer\'s order, you need to sit down at the table with them and make them think you\'re interested. Write your name down for them and make them feel special. "Oh man, I am so bored. Thank God you guys came in." If you want good tips, the most important thing is physical contact. Just a simple hold of the arm can mean the difference between five and twenty dollars. "I\'ll be right back with your order, guys." \'\'[holds Ferrari\'s shoulder]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ferrari|Wow, thank you so much, Mercedes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mercedes|Okay.

What the hell are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[sips some coffee]\'\' Breathing deep in darkness that envelops my soul. \'\'[sips some coffee. Pete jerks his hair back into place]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|God-damnit dude, your mom and dad want you to come home!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So they can fill my head with more Disney lies about how perfect the world is? I don\'t think so.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|Yeah.

Go try living in a Third-World country, you little pussy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|I\'m not gonna live in a Third-World country with all the conformists.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stan, this is it. Time to stop feeling sorry for yourself and come home! Everyone cares about you and everyone wants you back!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What about Wendy? Isn\'t she still with Token?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. She is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Then people shouldn\'t care about me-ehhh. Because I don\'t care about them.

Have fun being miserable.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[sips some coffee]\'\' ...conformist.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Other Goths|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Raisins, night.

To objectify girls like this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Porsche|\'\'[arrives]\'\' Hi guys.

Where I supposed to be working?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|No, I mean you shouldn\'t work somewhere where you\'re paid for how you look.

That would be sooo cool! I had a cancer sore on my lip once and it hurt sooo bad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|... Oh.

And some girls, like these, turn that into a profession.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh, I see. \'\'[gets angry]\'\' You don\'t approve of my girlfriend! \'\'[Lexus looks off and smiles at somebody]\'\' Well let me tell \'\'you\'\' somethin\', Mom and Dad, our love is as pure as a mountain spring! The odds may be stacked against us, but we\'re gonna give it our best shot! And so, if you can\'t be happy for us, y-you can just go to heck, Mom and Dad! \'\'[walks away from the table with Lexus]\'\' Come on, Lexus.

I guess you can join up with us if you want.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|Yeah. We\'re gonna go to the graveyard and write poems about death and how pointless life is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Uh, uhm no thanks. I I love life.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Huh? But you just got dumped.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wuh-ell yeah, and I\'m sad, but at the same time I\'m really happy that somethin\' could make me feel that sad. It\'s like, \'\'[sobs]\'\' it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel human. And the only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt somethin\' really good before. So I have to take the bad with the good, so I guess what I\'m feelin\' is like a, beautiful sadness. I guess that sounds stupid...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No. No, Butters, that doesn\'t sound stupid at all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, thanks for offerin\' to let me in your clique, guys, uh but, to be honest, I\'d rather be a cryin\' little pussy than a faggy Goth kid. Well see ya, Stan. \'\'[walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He\'s right. I don\'t even know who I am anymore. I like liking life a whole lot more than hating it.

Aren\'t you still wallowing in pain?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, it still hurts a lot, but ...I just realized that there\'s gonna be a lot of painful times in life, so, I\'d better learn to deal with it the right way. \'\'[Tolkien and Wendy walk by at this point]\'\' Hey Wendy! \'\'[Tolkien and Wendy look]\'\' You\'re a bitch,..
