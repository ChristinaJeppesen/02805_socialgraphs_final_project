People won\'t ever even know that the wrong man is in the White House.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, I mean, look at it this way: Almost half the country did actually vote for Obama. If the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes Cartman stole, then, does it matter that much?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It matters, Stan. It it matters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|A Santa|\'\'[voice only]\'\' Ho ho ho hoo! \'\'[Kyle glances at the TVs and walks over to get a better look]\'\' Come on down to Stevenson Hummer for our big Christmas in Humvember Sale! \'\'[same dealership as earlier, with Mr. Hummer wearing Santa facial hair and cap, ringing a bell and shaking a rattle stick]\'\' Not sure what to get your loved one this holiday season? Why not give them a nice Hummer? Nothing beats a Hummer on Christmas morning! \'\'[dances a bit.

A diner leaves Café Monet and walks down the street.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Stevenson|\'\'[the salesman]\'\' Hey, looking for a Hummer today? Got some 2009s here. Never been driven. ...Ever. \'\'[a crow lands on a blue Hummer. Mr. Stevenson notices, turns around and moves towards it]\'\' Go on, get out of here! Shoo! \'\'[the crow leaves as Kyle and friends show up and enter the lot]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Look! There they are!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Stevenson|Hey, hi there! You kids like Hummers, huh? Let me show you these babies!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We found it, you guys! \'\'[hears some vehicles showing up and looks]\'\' Oh no, they followed us! \'\'[several black cars pull up and the Chinese pour out of them]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Stevenson|Oh hell yes! Asians! Hey guys!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General Tso|Get out of our way!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No! These don\'t belong to you!

For democracy\'s sake, right Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 3|Sir, we\'ve found something, at the Hummer sales lot outside of town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|General Tso|You don\'t understand.

The officers all face him]\'\' Perhaps I can explain it to you. \'\'[appears between the Hummers and walks up to the group]\'\' You see, it turns out the only reason the Chinese so desperately wanted \'\'Star Wars\'\' is because they\'re afraid that Disney might not be the right place for it. The Chinese simply want to guard \'\'Star Wars\'\' impeccable legacy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 5|Is that Morgan Freeman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Morgan Freeman|And now we\'re at a crossroads. If these ballots are made public, then the man the people voted for will be President, but he will no doubt keep \'\'Star Wars\'\' from the Chinese, and allow Disney to keep it instead. And so we have to ask ourselves, "What\'s more important? That the right man is elected President, or that \'\'Star Wars\'\' is with people who will protect it most?" \'\'[six new freckles appear on his face, and he caresses his right cheek]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|An Officer|\'\'[through a walkie-talkie]\'\' Unit 4, what is it?!
