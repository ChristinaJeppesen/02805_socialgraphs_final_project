He turns around]\'\' Wha- ...what was that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|Well, I was just saying that the policies have really changed.

Huh-... how much money, exactly?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|\'\'[busy doing paperwork]\'\' Oh. Well, there was the case out in Minnesota where the guy was awarded... 25 million, I think.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Yeh-you don\'t say. \'\'[strokes his chin]\'\' Well thanks, uh, Principal Victoria. \'\'[walks out and closes the door]\'\' Holy Moly!

I will not put up with foolishness in my class! It\'s time for punishment! \'\'[reaches into his desk and pulls out a paddle, then strikes it against his left palm twice.

You know better than to discriminate against homosexuals!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah but, these guys are really super-gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[displeased]\'\' Aw I\'m surprised at \'\'you\'\', Stanley.

We\'re not raising our kids to be discriminators!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|That\'s right! I think it\'s time you kids took a little trip to the Museum of Tolerance! \'\'[Gerald crosses his arms.

The five boys and their parents arrive at the museum.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|\'\'[a woman greeting the families inside the museum]\'\' Welcome to the Museum of Tolerance.

I wanna ride again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|\'\'[leads them into the Hall of Stereotypes]\'\' We are now entering the Hall of Stereotypes. These wax figures represent how some intolerant people have labeled minorities. \'\'[leads them to the first exhibit]\'\' Here we see a black person eating chicken and watermelon, a stereotype that hurts the African-American community. What other stereotypes do you see here? \'\'[the stereotypes are exhibits, each one with its own spotlight]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[walks up to another exhibit with Stan and Kyle]\'\' Ah, here\'s the Arab as a terrorist. \'\'[the Arab is holding a Kalashnikov rifle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|That\'s right. But of course, we know that not all Arabs are terrorists, don\'t we, kids?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[sees a third exhibit]\'\' W-w-well there\'s an Asian over there with a calculator. \'\'[walks over to it. The others follow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|That\'s right. Not all stereotypes are negative. But even a positive one like "All Asians are good at math" is harmful to society.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[over at a fourth exhibit, a man cowering over a bag of money]\'\' Look, a covetous Jew!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|\'\'[arrives with the others]\'\' Very good, young man. The idea that Jews are only interested in money is very old indeed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[notices a fifth spotlight and walks to it]\'\' Ah, here\'s a good one. \'\'[Stan walks up next to him]\'\' It\'s the stereotypical "sleepy Mexican." \'\'[a man sleeps under the spotlight sitting up next to a mop and bucket]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Janitor|\'\'[wakes up]\'\' Wai-what? Oh man, what time is it? \'\'[stands up and rubs the back of his neck]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[in a low voice]\'\' Oh I\'m sorry. I thought you were a wax sculpture.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Janitor|Naw, man. I\'m the janitor. I\'m s\'pose to be cleaning but I\'m so tired. Ongh, so sleepy. \'\'[walks off with the mop and bucket]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|\'\'[leads them into the Tolerance Discovery Lab]\'\' This is our discovery wing. Take your time at the computer displays \'\'[they measure tolerance I.Q.]\'\', because you see, being tolerant you must also learn to respect people who are small, people who are disabled, even people who are overweight, \'\'[moves her arms towards Cartman]\'\' like this young man here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ey!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|You other boys have probably called this young man names like "tubby," or "lardbutt," or "fat tits,"...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|"Fat tits." That\'s a good one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, I have to remember that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|But you \'\'must\'\' learn to be tolerant of \'\'his\'\' differences as well. If he chooses to eat fatty foods, that\'s his life choice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[strokes his chin and tries something out]\'\' I\'m not fat, I have a different life choice.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|And we won\'t belittle you for eating lots of cookies and cakes and pies.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Duhuhude, tolerance kicks ass! \'\'[the adults chuckle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|That\'s our Cartman. \'\'[Cartman grins]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Museum of Tolerance, outside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Well, that\'s the end of our tour.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Now do you see why tolerance is so important, boys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I guess.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|We have to accept people for who they are and what they like to do. \'\'[notices someone nearby]\'\' Hey! What the hell are you doing? \'\'[it\'s a man smoking on the edge of the fountain]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Smoker|Oh I was just uh-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|There\'s no smoking in the museum!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Smoker|But I\'m not in the museum.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Get out of here, you filthy smoker! \'\'[the smoker rises and walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Yeah, dirty lungs!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Go ahead and kill yourself, stupid tar-breath!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Dumbass!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|Get out of here! \'\'[the smoker walks out of view]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Well, have a great day, everybody.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Now you boys can go and give your teacher and assistant the respect they deserve. Right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The boys|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day, Garrison\'s class. Mr. Garrison enters, having previously set up a chemistry experiment on the teacher\'s desk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay, children, let\'s take our seats. Uh, apparently, none of you tried to get me fired yesterday, so I guess we\'re just gonna have to go on and learn more today. \'\'[sits on a corner of the desk]\'\' Now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the Bunsen burner?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|It evaporates.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Good, Butters. Now if we take the glass tube of the Bunsen burner, we can also see how other things react. \'\'[takes the tube in hand and walks over to Mr. Slave]\'\' Evaporation is an exothermic reaction, so let\'s look at an endothermic one. Mr. Slave, position 7 please. \'\'[Mr. Slave looks up from his magazine, then assumes the position over his little desk and lowers his pants enough to show his ass]\'\' Now I\'m gonna put the glass tube under Mr. Slave\'s tight ass. \'\'[steps backwards and inserts the tube.

Now what do you think is gonna happen when I introduce the element of the gerbil to the endothermic heat of Mr. Slave\'s ass? \'\'[the kids are all aghast]\'\' Well let\'s see. \'\'[lifts up the Bunsen tube and sends the gerbil on its way down]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Slave|AAH. \'\'[the gerbil enters Mr. Slave\'s lower intestine and comes across the skeleton of another gerbil. It turns back immediately and runs for the anal opening. Mr. Garrison pulls the tube out and the sphincter snaps shut, trapping the gerbil inside. It tries to claw its way out]\'\' AAH. \'\'[moves his head around]\'\' Dude! Jesus Christ! AAH!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[realizing what just happened]\'\' Lemmiwinks? NO!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, lunch time.

You have to ask yourself, "What is it about their behavior that, for some reason, makes \'\'me\'\' uncomfortable?"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, I guess it\'s mostly the way Mr. Garrison stuck a gerbil up Mr. Slave\'s ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Right. And you see, children, that\'s why you need to- Whoa! What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Are we homophobes now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We don\'t \'\'wanna\'\' be gay bashers, Chef.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Children, there\'s a BIG difference between gay people and Mr. Garrison!
