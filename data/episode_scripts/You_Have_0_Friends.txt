He looks away from the monitor and sighs, wiping a tear from his nose. A small pop-up window appears. Kip looks at it, then startles himself. He gets to his keyboard and reads the window: "Kyle Broflovski has added you as a friend." He rubs his eyes in disbelief and looks again. "Confirm Kyle as your friend?" He moves the cursor down to the "Confirm" button and clicks on it. Now his page reads "You have 1 friends."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kip|\'\'[getting excited]\'\' Ahhhhh. \'\'[gets off his stool and runs around the room]\'\' Haaa! Haaaaaaaaaa!

Run to your Facebook account and delete Kyle from your friend list because he is poison and I don\'t see him making a comeback any time soon. \'\'[presses a big red button, which produces a shotgun blast]\'\' You\'re gonna want to dump Kyle and if at all possible add Clyde Donovan. Why? \'\'[shows a birthday cake]\'\' Birthday! That\'s right, Clyde has a birthday coming up and his mom is taking everyone to Casa Bonita. \'\'[presses a button that produces the sound of a whistle]\'\' If you don\'t have Clyde as a friend, you\'re gonna want to add him, because Clyde\'s numbers are about to go way up! And now, Word On The Street. \'\'[cranks up a player that repeats "Word On The Street"]\'\' The rumors are now becoming more than that; Jimmy and Bebe have agreed to share their friends. That\'s right. Looks like we\'re about to have a merger \'\'[presses a robot that says "MERGER"]\'\' So if you\'re a friend of Jimmy\'s you\'re about to luck into about 90 chick friends, and as we all know, chick friends are worth almost triple what dude friends are.
