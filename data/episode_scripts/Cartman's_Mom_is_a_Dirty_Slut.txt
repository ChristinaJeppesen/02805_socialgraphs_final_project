He\'s gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|I am not gay!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Then you did sleep with my mom?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|He\'s gay!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay, Okay! I admit it! I might have made love to your mother at the Drunken Barn Dance! But who here didn\'t?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Everything stops and gasps are heard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Now come on, honestly. Who here has never had sex with Mrs. Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Two men at a table look around and get shocked. Principal Victoria and Mayor McDaniels are seen next.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Principal Victoria|Oooooh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|\'\'[At the same time]\'\' Hmmm.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus and Father Maxi look shocked as well. No one moves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Grizzled Man|I haven\'t.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|...You don\'t count, Halfy-you don\'t have any legs!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Halfy|Oh. Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|So you see, Eric, anyone here could be your father. I\'m afraid you\'re never going to know.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman slumps and Jimbo takes pity on him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|\'\'[Approaching him.]\'\' Don\'t feel too bad there, kid. I never knew who my father was either. I mean, I did know who he was and well, we had some great times together in huntin\' and fishin\' whe-well, hell, you know what I mean.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A dirge plays as Cartman heads out of the bar. Jimbo and Mr. Garrison look on, as do Jesus and Father Maxi.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Wait, wait. \'\'[Cartman stops.]\'\' I know a way to find out.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He is at the bar with his little friend, Kevin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Turns around.]\'\' How?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|At my laboratory. We can do DNA genetic testing. I\'ll take some of your blood along with the blood of everyone here, and we can determine who your father is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Really? You can? \'\'[The dirge turns hopeful.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Yes, of course! I mean, that much testing will cost a pretty penny but...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|How much?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Three thousand should cover it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I don\'t have $3000.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Oh. Never mind.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bus stop, next day. Stan and Kyle are waiting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude! I can\'t wait to win that $10,000 on \'\'America\'s Stupidest Home Videos\'\'. I\'m gonna buy the coolest go-cart ever.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'m gonna buy a \'\'Walkman\'\' with \'\'my\'\' half.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Depressed.]\'\' Hi guys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|How\'s it going, Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, fine. How are you guys?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle looks at Stan, both are worried.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude. What the hell is wrong with you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ohh. Nothing. It\'s just... nothing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, what\'s the matter, Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, I wanna know who my dad is, but... to find out they have to do these DNA tests, and they cost $3000 and... I don\'t have $3000.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow. We\'re sorry your mom\'s a whore, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, it sucks. I have to know who my father is, I just have to. Maybe I can work in a sweatshop for a while uh...}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan and Kyle look at each other again, seeing who\'ll make a move first.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, see you guys. I\'m gonna go stay in my backyard for a while.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Uuuh, Cartman. We know how you can get $3000.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Suddenly bright.]\'\' You do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yyeah. We have a videotape that\'s in the finals for \'\'America\'s Stupidest Home Videos\'\', and... if we win, we\'ll give you - 3000 of out $10,000 prize.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You will? Wow, you guys are the best! Thank you guys!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh, yyeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house that night. The boys are on the sofa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|And now, back to \'\'America\'s Stupidest Home Videos\'\'-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What kind of video did you guys make?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uuh, you\'ll see.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|Well, it\'s time to crown the $10,000 winner. Our judges have narrowed it down to only three videos-first it\'s... "Dog Who Puts Hat On Master\'s Head."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Falsetto Bob Saget|Oh, I\'m a little dog. I\'m just a little dog. \'\'[The dog picks up a hat and walks towards a man on a chair.]\'\' Hahaha. \'\'[Leaps up behind the man and drops the hat in place.]\'\' Hold on, I\'ve got to put a hat on my master\'s head, \'\'[Jumps off, and the man turns to see the camera.]\'\' hehehahahuh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience laughs. One woman with red curly hair is particularly tickled by the video.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|And now our second finalist, "Little Boy Has A Tea Party."}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman reacts to what he sees on screen, which is a video of his tea party two days before.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Why, thank you Polly Prissy Pants. You are my best friend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Polly|Oh, thank you, Eric.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience starts to laugh. Cartman is shocked, and Kyle, seeing Cartman\'s reaction, is afraid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|Boy! Looks like \'\'this\'\' kid needs some therapy! Heheheheheh, heheheh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'re sure to win, Cartman. Then you get your DNA money!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s anger is beginning to build.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I... am... so... pissed... off... right... now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[Trying some encouragement]\'\' They laughed hardest at our video. We\'re gonna win!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan smiles, Kyle throws his arms up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re gonna win!.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|And finally our third contestant, "Young Child Gets Hit By A Train."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Falsetto Bob Saget|Oh, I\'m such a cute little kid.}}\n{{ScriptScene|It is the scene where Kenny gets killed. Stan and Kyle are shocked, Cartman is angrier.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Falsetto Bob Saget|Hmmm, I wonder if I can get this go-cart started.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The go-cart starts and pulls Kenny along \'round a corner, back again, into some tree, and finally onto the railroad tracks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Falsetto Bob Saget|Oh! I hope I don\'t get hit by a train.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The train demolishes him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Falsetto Bob Saget|Ooooh, I sure did.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan and Kyle are agape, and the audience roars with laughter.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my God, they videotaped killing Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You bastards!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|Now, that\'s what I call a joyride. Heeheeheeh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience continues laughing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|And the winner is, naturally, "Little Boy Being Hit By A Train,"}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan is stunned, Kyle is cross.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|Nnnnhnnnhnnnh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The audience laughs harder.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude. We \'\'lost\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dammit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Slowly, deliberately.]\'\' I am going to fucking kill you guys, seriously.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Getting more livid with every word.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|Stand up and take a bow, Mr. Marsh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Grandpa|I won! I won!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s eyes grow large.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Grandpa!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bob Saget|Our other finalists will have to settle for their $3000 runner-up prizes-well, see you next time.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He chuckles as the show ends.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Did you hear that, dude? We still get $3000. That\'s enough for you to do your DNA test.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman is very livid now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kill... you... guys! \'\'Kill you guys!!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Genetic Engineering Ranch. Thunder and lightning abound.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|All right. From everyone\'s accounts, I\'ve narrowed down Eric\'s possible father... to the people in this room: Officer Barbrady, Chef \'\'[Blinks up.]\'\', Jimbo \'\'[A bit shocked.]\'\', Mr. Garrison \'\'[Eyebrows up.]\'\', Ned, Chief Running Water, Gerald Broflovski \'\'[Surprised.]\'\', myself, my friend Kevin \'\'[Looks up at him.]\'\', or, the 1989 Denver Broncos.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow. I always knew Cartman\'s mom was a slut, but \'\'Goddamn!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|The test results are in this envelope.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman is hopeful.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Shall I... open it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[Impatiently.]\'\' Yes! For God\'s sake, get on with it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|Erhum ehrum uh \'\'[Gasps.]\'\' The father of Eric Cartman is indeed, someone in this room. The father is-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|\'\'[An organ plays.]\'\' Who is Eric Cartman\'s father? Is it - Chief Running Water? \'\'[Looks askance.]\'\' Or is it - Chef? Is it Mephesto? \'\'[Looks around.]\'\' Or that little monkey guy that follows him around? Or is it Mr. Garrison?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Nope. He\'s gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|You go to hell! You go to hell and you die!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Is it Jimbo?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|\'\'[Aghast.]\'\' Daaagh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Or is Officer Barbrady?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Huh?!
