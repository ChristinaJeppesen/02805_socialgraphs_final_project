The lion leaps on the bear, trying to go for the jugular, but the bear grabs it and throws it off. The lion hits a cliff wall and falls onto the ground, dazed, but quickly gets up and sinks its fangs into Chef\'s head. Chef\'s face and left eye are ripped off and Chef is left babbling. The lion bites into Chef\'s right arm again while the bear has a hold of Chef\'s right foot, and at the same time, bear and lion each take a limb. Chef\'s legs and hips rip away from his torso, and Chef is effectively dead. The bear and lion walk off in different directions with their meals.

CHEF."\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re all here today because Chef has been such an important part of our lives.
