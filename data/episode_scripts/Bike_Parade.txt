An audience filled studio with Josh, in a box, on a pedestal with a glass of water on a stool nearby.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Josh|How is the common worker kept submissive?

Just go on, making total asses of ourselves?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[turns away from the bridge, followed by Stan and Cartman]\'\' No. No!

We can\'t get the parade cancelled for us.

Did we think this was a fucking joke? The bike parade is offensive, and the government thinks they can just force it on everyone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Come on!

Before, there was war between classes, customers and workers at odds. All I\'ve done is create the new class: the consumer-worker. The future.

Anyways... you see, Tegridy is something that can\'t be understood by big corporations! Oh, they\'ll try to package Tegridy, but only I can really package Tegridy. I got more money now \'cause of Tegridy, and that\'s \'cause I figured out how to get Tegridy to everyone. And that\'s- now everyone is in their state of Tegridy that\'s impenetrable. Am I making sense?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bezos|NO!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|The point is, nobody\'s comin\' to work for you!
