Now we\'re just happy we won\'t have to live a life of secrets. For I knew that even though some of you supported us, some others were looking at me and thinking, "You\'re a liar! You\'re a LIAR!" \'\'[points at the crowd, and Condit\'s fixed-grin face is shown]\'\' "You know somethin\' that you\'re not telling us, you slimy, scumbag liar!" \'\'[back to Chris]\'\' Eh you know, that\'s what people would say to me.

Tell us what you know you God-damned liar!" \'\'[back to Chris]\'\' And so, to both of us, people all over town would be saying things like, \'\'[a shot of the Ramseys]\'\' "You know God-damn well what happened to your kid, so stop acting like victims, and confess, you MURDERING MURDERERS!" \'\'[a shot of O.J.]\'\' "CONFESS!" \'\'[a shot of Condit]\'\' "LIAR! CONFESS!" \'\'[back to Chris]\'\' You know, and, that\'s what people would be saying to us, and so, we just had to come forward and tell the truth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|We\'re sorry we lied to you all.
