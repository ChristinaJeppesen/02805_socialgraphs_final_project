\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|Broflovski residence, Gerald\'s office, daytime. Gerald is seen sitting down as he types on his computer, presumably doing work. All of a sudden, Kyle comes rushing into the office as he begins to talk fast and pace around the room excitedly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dad! Dad, there\'s this new place and you can actually go and shoot each other, only it\'s soft BBs and they\'re biodegradable, and the guns are, like, totally real except you don\'t actually get hurt, and it\'s like paintball except for there\'s no mess, and the stuff all looks totally real, and it\'s called Airsoft and can I get one?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|\'\'[confused]\'\' Wha– Wha– What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There\'s an airsoft field where everybody plays on teams, and I promise I\'ll take good care of the equipment, and if you think about it, it\'s a really great hobby for team building and learning communication and –}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I was just thinking if you could come to the Airsoft store with me – \'\'[clasps his hands together]\'\' please, please, please, all my friends already bought their stuff, and it\'s totally a way for us to play outside like you always say – \'\'[rushes out to the door]\'\' come on, please only we can\'t tell mom cuz she won\'t understand, but it\'s totally safe cuz you wear eye protection.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|\'\'[gets up from his chair]\'\' Okay, okay, Kyle, breathe.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A few moments later, they both arrive outside of South Park Airsoft Armory. Kyle gets out of the car, clearly excited to enter the shop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Here it is! Isn\'t this cool?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|"Airsoft Armory"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Come on, dad! You gotta check it out!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Inside the shop. Kyle opens the doors and rushes inside to check everything it has to offer. Gerald walks inside too, looking rather surprised to the amount of fake artillery they sell.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|My God! Is this stuff real?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, dad! It\'s Airsoft. It\'s like paintball, only it\'s way cooler and it just looks totally real.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I-I really don\'t think your mom would approve, Kyle…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dad… please. I\'m not a baby anymore. The other guys – they already got their stuff. We\'re playing today! Can I please just get, like, an AK-47 and maybe a glock?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|This stuff is expensive! Is this really how you want to spend your allowance?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[excitedly]\'\' Yeah, yeah! It really is! \'\'[he walks away to check out other merchandise]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|These are all, like, legal, right?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Armory Salesman|Uh, yes, sir. You see, you load these soft BBs into the guns and they just kinda sting. And you can put the soft BBs into grenades, rocket launchers, all kinds of stuff.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|So it\'s all totally safe?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Armory Salesman|Well, I wouldn\'t particularly say that…I mean – all the stuff is safe, the guns and grenades and things… but – but not necessarily the people who mostly play Airsoft…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|What people mostly play Airsoft?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Armory Salesman|Teenagers. \'\'[the music intensifies]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Blinky\'s Airsoft. Teenagers are gathered around looking all bored and uninterested as they listen to the referee\'s instructions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Alright, Airsofters, let\'s listen up. Before we let you onto the field, we need to run through our safety precautions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenagers|\'\'[in unison]\'\' Bruhhh..}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 1|We know all the safety stuff – }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|First, your Airsoft guns must all have a red tip –}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 2|Bruh, we know…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Second, there is no full auto allowed on the field.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 3|Bruh…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Third, there is a 500 fps limit for your BBs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 1|Bruh, can we play now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|If you\'re hit by a BB, raise your hand, say "hit", and go back to respawn.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 2|Yes, already, yes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Alright, you guys are Team Rogue Wolf. \'\'[he pulls out a clipboard]\'\' You guys will be playing against– where is Team Floppy Weiner?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Right here!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle, Stan, Kenny and Cartman come into frame a few moments later with Airsoft guns and equipment in hand. The boys look excited to play some Airsoft.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 3|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 2|Bruh, no! We aren\'t playing with little kids!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 3|Yeah, it\'ll be too easy!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Alright, fine! Then we\'ll split the kids up on two teams and each one will have a teenager partner.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 3|Bruh, seriously?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Kid with the poof ball, that\'s your teenager–}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 1|Bruh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Green hat kid, that\'s your teenager– Team B, those are your two teenagers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright, sweet! Me and Kenny and our teenagers are gonna smoke you guys!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Airsoft battle area. Everyone begins to get into their positions as the game is set to begin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 4|Go! Go, go, go, go!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 1|Come on! This way! \'\'[BB bullets begin to go off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes! Yes! Yes!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Intense music begins playing as the boys and the teenagers play Airsoft intensely. The sound of BB bullets are heard all over the field as the teams try to eliminate each other.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Meanwhile, Kyle and Cartman get into a safe position in the field. Kyle shoots BBs at Cartman and successfully manages to hit him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I got you, Cartman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You didn\'t get me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I totally got you! I heard it hit your jacket. Say hit and and go back to respawn.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You didn\'t hit me, Kyle! The BBs bounced off a leaf or something, \'cause– \'\'[Kyle begins to fire off BBs and Cartman raises a hand in defeat]\'\' Agh, agh! Ok – ok, hit! You got me. That was sweet. \'\'[walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I\'m outta green gas, you got green gas?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, I got some right here, partner! \'\'[he gets out an air tank and hands it to his partner]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny\'s Teenager|Bruh, keep shooting!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah!! Woo-hoo!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|In another area of the airsoft field. Kyle is wandering around aimlessly, looking for other targets. Cartman is behind him with a BB sniper rifle and begins to slowly aim toward Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[to himself]\'\' Oh, my God… this is the greatest day of my fucking life.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman slowly steadies his aim, and after a few seconds, he shoots a BB at Kyle\'s face.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ow, oww! \'\'[he raises his hand and walks off]\'\' Hit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes! Yes!! That was so awesome!! You guys, Airsoft fucking rules! This is– \'\'[a BB goes off and hits him in the chest]\'\' Ow! Hit! Hit! This is sweet!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Later in the day. The boys are walking back home from Blinky\'s Airsoft. On the way back, they express their excitement over today.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That was so cool!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Best thing ever!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(That was fucking great!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, I can\'t believe we tied! That was epic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, well, Team Floppy Weiner will get you guys next time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That was seriously the best time I\'ve had in forever!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Me too!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|And you know what else is cool? We all have teenagers now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I know! My teenager said he\'s gonna come over and show me how to clean my gun! \'\'[he notices Cartman crying]\'\' Cartman? Are you ok?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[sniffles]\'\' I\'m just really happy, you guys… \'\'[his voice breaks a bit from crying]\'\' Airsoft is seriously, like, the greatest thing in the whole world. Well, here\'s my house. Thanks, you guys. For just a few, brief hours I forgot how much everything sucks. \'\'[he walks back home]\'\' Can we promise each other we\'ll do Airsoft, like, all the time?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hell yeah, dude! We just gotta keep our teenagers happy and we can play Airsoft all the time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[softly]\'\' I love you guys. \'\'[he makes his way inside his hot dog house]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Broflovski residence, the bathroom, nighttime. Kyle is standing on a stool as he applies makeup on his cheek to cover up his bruise from earlier today in Airsoft. Kyle has a smile on his face. Gerald walks in on him, looking confused at what Kyle is doing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Hey, Kyle… Uh, how did the Airsoft go?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I took a BB right to the face with a sniper rifle. It was so great, dad!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Are you sure this isn\'t all a little too much for you, son?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'m not a baby anymore, dad! \'\'[the doorbell rings]\'\' Ooh! Oh, that\'s probably my teenager! See ya, dad! I love you! \'\'[he makes his way to go open the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I love you too, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[the doorbell ring is being constantly rung]\'\' I got it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sheila|Gerald… why is Kyle wearing my makeup on his face?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|He\'s just… experimenting.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Downstairs in the living room. Kyle walks over to the front door to open it as the doorbell constantly rings. He opens the door to see his teenager and the mother.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mother|Are you Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mother|I\'m here to drop off Trevor. He said he is your teenager now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, that\'s right!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mother|Okay! Well, good luck.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|What time are you picking me up?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mother|Just gimme a call– don\'t make it too soon, though, because I am going to relax.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|Fine, go ahead, I\'m glad! Go away, I don\'t wanna see your stupid fucking face!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Trevor flips off his mother and enters inside. He makes himself comfortable on the living room couch as he grabs the TV remote and scrolls through channels.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cool, dude, so, uh, you wanna, like, clean our Airsoft guns?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|\'\'[angrily]\'\' I\'m fucking starving to death! Can you make me some fucking food?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well…Like, what kind of food do you want?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|Fucking leave me alone!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay! Okay! Okay! \'\'[he walks away from Trevor]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tegridy Farms, Stan\'s room. He is cleaning his airsoft gun and his phone begins to ring. He picks up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Bruh, how do I make ramen?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[pause]\'\' Excuse me?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I\'m starving, and the instructions are all stupid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, is this my teenager? How\'s it going, dude?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|It\'s not going! The ramen\'s all hard and I can\'t eat it like that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, you have to put the noodles in boiling water.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Where do I get water?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You… Do you have a sink?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Bruh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Bruh, what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I\'m sorry I\'m not a five-star chef!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey, man, it\'s cool! Lemme, uh– lemme slow it down for ya.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s hot dog house. Cartman is watching Airsoft compilation videos on his phone.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Swamp Sniper|That one right there! Take him out!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Dude, Swamp Sniper rules.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A few seconds later, Cartman\'s teenager walks inside without saying a word. He walks up to the refrigerator to look for food.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[confused]\'\' Hello? \'\'[his teenager says nothing]\'\' What– What are you doing, dude?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman\'s Teenager|I need a bathroom!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You– You need to use my bathroom?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman\'s Teenager|I have to go to the bathroom– brah, what?! \'\'[he enters the bathroom and slams the door shut]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|McCormick Residence, living room. A knock is heard on the door and Kenny goes to open it. It\'s Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, Kenny, the weirdest thing just happened. My teenager showed up at my house and he\'s acting really strange.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah! Mine too.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yours did too?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny\'s Teenager|Why do I have all these fucking zits on my face?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Dude, I don\'t know, I\'m trying to think!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny\'s Teenager|You don\'t even fucking care! You don\'t care because you don\'t even fucking know me!! \'\'[he slams the bathroom door shut]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What the hell are these things?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Blinky\'s Airsoft arena, daytime. A match of Airsoft is taking place. Stan and Kenny are with their respective teams. Kenny runs for cover and begins to shoot BBs at the enemy team. Stan sneaks out to check if the coast is clear, but Kenny begins to shoot. He runs for cover with his teenager teammate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, that\'s my friend Kenny, we gotta kill him!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I don\'t take orders from you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, okay, but if we kill Kenny we get a point, right? Come on!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The match continues on, as Stan fires more BBs. They all hit Kenny as he tries to run away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Agh! Hit, hit, hit!) \'\'[he raises his hand]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Referee|Hey, hey, hey! No shooting from less than 10 feet!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I wasn\'t less than 10 feet!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s okay, it\'s fine. We\'re sorry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I\'m not gonna play anymore. This is stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, it\'s ok, it\'s just a gay rule. Come on, let\'s beat these guys!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The match continues. More BBs begin to fire off and the game begins to intensify.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Teenager 1|Hit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[he takes his phone out and dials]\'\' Dude, Kyle, where are you? We started playing like 20 minutes ago.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Inside of a supermarket. Kyle is seen walking an aisle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, I know! My teenager asked me to take him shopping for hair gel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hair gel?! What the fuck, dude, we\'re getting killed out here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Just do your best, I\'ll be there as fast as I can! \'\'[hangs up the call]\'\' Okay, here it is. This is the health care aisle. Could you go a little faster?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Trevor, Kyle\'s teenager, walks very slowly while pushing on a shopping cart. He is looking down angrily at the floor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay, here\'s all the hair product stuff. Which one would you like to use?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|I don\'t know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|\'\'[loudly]\'\' I don\'t know!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[he walks up to Kyle]\'\' Kyle? What are you doing here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ugh, nothing, I\'m… I\'m just shopping with my teenager.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|Can we go now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Okay, but you asked me if I could buy you some hair gel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Trevor|Shut up…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, at least I\'m not the only one dealing with this crap.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s teenager walks in. Similarly to Trevor, he pushes a shopping cart slowly while looking down on the floor.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Your guy wants hair gel, too?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, my teenager wants more lotion. \'\'[he takes Kyle to the side to talk with him privately]\'\' All this guy does is hang out in the bathroom and go through like two bottles of lotion a day. I swear I don\'t know how soft you could possibly want your hands to be.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I just wanna get to the Airsoft field. Stan says your team is killing them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[excitedly]\'\' Damn right! Team Floppy Weiner will destroy you guys!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, we\'ll see when I use my sniper rifle!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You have to find me first!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman\'s Teenager|I gotta go to the bathroom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me! There\'s one over by the registers. No, you are not taking the lotion! \'\'[he grabs it from his teenager]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman\'s Teenager|I fucking hate you! \'\'[he walks away angrily]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, I\'m sorry you hate me. Just wanna fucking play Airsoft, buddy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tegridy Farms. Stan is sleeping very comfortably, until he gets a phone call.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, my God, you gotta be shitting me. \'\'[Stan answers the phone]\'\' Yeah—hello?}}\n{{ScriptScene|In Stan\'s Teenager room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|\'\'[the teenager is playing with a lighter]\'\' I\'m not gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whuh—what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Why\'d you call me gay?! Like, what the hell do you know?! You don\'t even fucking know me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I-I didn\'t call you gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|They said I couldn\'t shoot a BB within 10 feet, and I just had to say bang bang, and you got all Salty and said I was gay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I was saying the rule was gay. I wasn\'t talking anything about sexual orientation.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Bruh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You\'re right, I shouldn\'t have used that word! Look—I was one of the first people ever to say there was nothing wrong with being gay. I had a dog that was gay!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Oh, so I\'m a fucking dog now?! I\'ll fucking kill you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, dude… what… do you want me to do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I want you to just leave me alone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, but you called me… hello? Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|\'\'[stars screaming]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I\'m holding my hand over a lighter!

Oh dude, it\'s fucking black! Is that what a third degree burn looks like?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Jesus fucking Christ.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Dood, I just so lit burned my hand. I need like—I need like emergency services. Bruh, that was stupid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, that was kinda stupid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|I\'m not fucking stupid!}}\n{{ScriptScene|At Denny\'s.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I seriously don\'t know what to do… I\'ve tried being nice, I\'ve tried being harsh… and I get nothing from my teenager. Nothing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah…)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, you\'re lucky. At least your teenager doesn\'t threaten to kill you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'d love him to threaten to do anything. I\'d love him to do. Anything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|On the rare occasion that my teenager isn\'t in the bathroom, all he does is talk about his miserable life. I\'m like—okay, dude, I\'ve got problems too. But of course teenagers don\'t care about your problems. I\'m like, "look, buddy, I live in a hot dog. Ok? Like, maybe let\'s stop bitching and just play Airsoft." But you can\'t say that because then they\'re just gonna—}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|Want to kill themselves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, yes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(So, what do we do? Do we give up Airsoft?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, we can\'t give up on Airsoft—I\'m like four hundred dollars into this hobby.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And we love it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Except for the part about being around teenagers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, apparently a lot of people are in the same situation we\'re in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What do you mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'ve been reading this book—"Help, My Teenager Hates Me".}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah…and… it has some interesting ideas. It says we\'re basically just dealing with an age difference and we need to try and connect with them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(How?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It says…we should take them camping.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[side-eyes Kenny]\'\' Camping?}}\n{{ScriptScene|At a camping spot. The boys are doing everything, while the teenagers sit around bored.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny\'s Teenager|Bruh…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Teenagers|Bruh…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright, guys! We got the tents all set up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, check \'em out!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah, it\'s really beautiful.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There\'s a lake over there where we can rent kayaks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So, what do you guys wanna do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan\'s Teenager|Go home?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'Kay, yeah, we can do that later, but first maybe, um… let\'s bond a bit…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[waiting outside the bathroom]\'\' Okay, looks like the tents are set up—can you come out now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman\'s Teenager|\'\'[inside the bathroom]\'\' I\'m going to the bathroom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, well, you should probably finish up. I know you took the lotion in there. You really don\'t need soft hands for camping.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman\'s Teenager|\'\'[inside the bathroom]\'\' Leave me alone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Cartman tries opening the door, but it\'s locked, so he knocks]\'\' Come on, dude.

I just can\'t deal with teenagers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Oh. Well, you know, they say that the… brain chemistry of a teenager is the same as that of a psychopath. The hormones and all that—it\'s been proven they\'re literally criminally insane.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You know, I just \'\'[Kyle starts to get teary eyed]\'\'—I just wanted to have fun—and shoot my friends. \'\'[Kyle reaches closer to Gerald, crying]\'\' I-I just wanted to shoot my friends, dad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|\'\'[Gerald hugs Kyle]\'\' Oh, buddy. Well, maybe you could ask the Airsoft field to let you play without the teenagers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We did! They said they hate the teenagers just as much as anybody, but they can\'t get rid of them. And we\'ve got no one else to partner with.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Well… did you guys ever consider your dads?}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Airsoft Armory.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Come on in, boys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Jesus Christ…}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|How long has this store been here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|\'\'[Gerald grabs one of the rifles and cocks it]\'\' What do you think? This one can shoot a thousand BBs in like five seconds.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Seems pretty dangerous. What if the police thought that gun was real?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|No, it\'s safe. See? As long as your gun has a red tip and you\'re white, police won\'t shoot you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh, that\'s good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Armory Salesman|How can I, uh… help you gentlemen?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|We need some equipment. We\'re gonna try and take out some teenagers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Airsoft Armory Salesman|Uh… I think that\'s a somewhat foolhardy plan. Have you seen the kind of weaponry the teenagers buy? It\'s some of the biggest, nastiest weapons we sell.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Yeah, well, I\'ve got something bigger. \'\'[Gerald pulls out a credit card]\'\' American Express Platinum.
