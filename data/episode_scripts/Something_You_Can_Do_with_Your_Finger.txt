What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[retrieves a TV cart with VCR and pops the VCR in. The video pops up]\'\' If you would, sir, just watch this and prepare to be wowed! \'\'[at first, only the boys\' hats are seen, near the play elephants.

[The camera turns left again and catches a glimpse of the girls, then ends up on Cartman, and zooms in on the cucumber]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uh, god dammit..!

This video is dumb.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[dead air on tape]\'\' You don\'t understand. Girls were going crazy for it. Please. This is what God want me to do.

You will?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Manager|Only for twenty minutes, though.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s all we need! How about this afternoon at 3 o\'clock?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Manager|Oh. Okay. \'\'[static shows up on the video]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes!

[Cartman is shocked at what he sees; the manager is pleased]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aw, Mom!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Manager|Wow. What?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Marsh residence, later. Stan sits on the sofa as Randy paces the floor back and forth}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s not fair, Dad! Why can\'t I be in a boy band?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Because I said so!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, Cartman said we\'re gonna perform at the mall at 3 o\'clock.

Stan looks at him with his mouth hanging open in shock, and Randy stands up, ashamed and shocked at his behavior. He walks back to Stan, then turns away defeated]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad? What the hell is going on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy| ...I was... I was 18 when my high-school men\'s choir performed at the grand opening of a sporting-goods store in Denver. \'\'[a flashback starts. A young Randy is at lower left corner of the choir, and the choir begins this song: "Everything will wait / Weave all ye little reins..."] I was just one of fifteen members and I had no idea that a record producer was in the audience. [the audience claps. The producer is in the second row of spectators. The choir members split up and the producer rushes up to Randy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Kid, can I talk to you?|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Uh sure.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Heh, you were really great up there. Too good for a pissant choir in a pissant mountain town.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ohh, thanks.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Listen: I\'m putting together a rock group. A vocal group called the Ghetto Avenue Boys. I think you would make a perfect member.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What? Me? Do you like my singing that much?|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Yeah, I think your mustache is perfect. How would you like to come to New York and start a singing career?|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh my God, I don\'t know. I mean, I still have another year of high school, and I--|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Hey, look, if you don\'t want it, I\'ll keep looking--|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[interrupting]\'\' No! Wait. I mean, ah-I\'ll think about it.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|I take it that means yes. Call me in the morning. \'\'[slips a business card into Randy\'s coat pocket and pats it]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|And just like that I left everything. I dropped out of high school...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[walks by Denver High]\'\' See ya. \'\'[walks away]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|...I said good-bye to my girlfriend...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|See ya. \'\'[waves, turns and walks away, leaving a distraught girl with mouth open]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|...And I left my family.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|See ya. \'\'[gets into his beat-up pale-yellow car and drives off, leaving his parents at the front door]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|And suddenly there I was, thrown into a group with four other young men who I didn\'t even know. \'\'[the five are recording their first song]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Producer|Take 112!|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ghetto Avenue Boys|<poem><i>You\'ve... got... it!\nYou know you\'ve got... it\n\'\'[Randy: Girl]\'\'\nWhat you\'ve got is it!</i></poem>|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|<poem><i>It\'s obvious to me, girl</i></poem>|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|The songs were terrible. But believe it or not, the country ate them up. The next thing I knew, we were the biggest thing in the world. \'\'[the song continues as he speaks, and the scene changes from the studio, to a poster, to a concert as the camera leaves the poster]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ghetto Avenue Boys|<poem><i>Shirl!

A huge house, [the backyard pool: he\'s resting on an inflatable chaise longue while women surround him] and all the women you can imagine. \'\'[nine bikini-clad women are in his bed, and he\'s rolling back and forth over all of them]\'\' And then one day, just as quick as it started...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Allens|\'\'[the Ghetto Avenue Boys enter to rehearse, but...]\'\' Alright, guys, let\'s take it from the top.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Hey, Mr. Allens.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Allens|Heh?

R-Randy.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Who are they? \'\'[five new guys are in the recording booth]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Allens|These are the Avenue Ghetto Street Boys, my... \'\'new\'\' boy band.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|But, w-we\'re still selling records, right?|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Allens|Look, kid, you\'re just getting a little... old to be in a boy band.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I\'m 19.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Allens|Get a life, Marsh! \'\'[the Ghetto Avenue Boys turn around and walk out the door]\'\' Alright, guys, let\'s take it from the top.|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|They said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio, so they towed my car...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tow Truck Driver|\'\'[wearing a "Tacos" hat]\'\' See ya. \'\'[tows a blue sports car away]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|...the women all left...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Women|See ya. \'\'[the women pour out of bed and leave]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|...and they took back my house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[gets kicked out of the house]\'\' Ugh..! \'\'[the producer stands at the French doors]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Allens|See ya. \'\'[Randy gets up and walks away]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|The only thing I could do was come back to Colorado, and face everyone that I had abandoned.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman|Hey! Weren\'t you the guy in that \'\'stupid\'\' boy band, the Ghetto Avenue Boys?|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Sure, I remember you! \'\'[starts mocking]\'\' You got it, baby... You got it, baby \'\'[he and the others begin to laugh, and it soon gets overwhelming. Randy looks around, scared. The flashback ends]\'\'|1}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[voice full of emotion]\'\' And so you see, Stanley, I... do know what I\'m talking about.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Jesus Christ. ...I never knew.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I didn\'t \'\'want\'\' you to know. Because now I\'m a joke. Ever since then, I\'ve wished \'\'every single day\'\' that I could go back to that moment when I was offered the job and say, "No!" Because all the fame and the money, the women... All it did was build me up, so that I could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world. \'\'[Stan is listening]\'\' That is what being in a boy band is all about, Stanley. \'\'[bitterness creeps in]\'\' It\'s people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last night\'s pork chops. Now we wander the Earth in disarray—us, New Kids on the Block, the Osmonds... We\'re all the same. And \'\'\'\'\'that\'\'\'\'\'... is why you can\'t go to the mall. \'\'[walks off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[left with his thoughts]\'\' ...Oh-kay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Mall, afternoon. Most of Fingerbang is on the plaza stage, peeking out from behind a curtain with the band\'s name on it. People begin to gather in front of the stage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wow. There must be at least 20 people out there. \'\'[the band regroups]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Where the hell is Stan?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He\'ll be here.

I can\'t keep the sausage and cheese cart off this spot much longer. \'\'[the cart is shown with Swiss cheese and sausage, and a pissed-off vendor]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah. We\'ll start right away. \'\'[the manager walks away. Cartman turns to Kyle]\'\' We\'ll have to do it without him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hell no! I\'m not being part of a four-member boy band! We\'ll look stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, god-dammit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Marsh residence, later. Randy is sitting at the foot of his bed, reading from an issue of Teen Heat dedicated to the band.

I just wanted to tell you... that I don\'t think you\'re a joke. I mean, whatever you used to be, you\'re just my dad.

I\'ve made some mistakes in my life, and now... I have to let you make your own mistakes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|You know, in a way, I think I was even jealous of you being in a boy band. Isn\'t that stupid?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Not really. Not any more stupid than some of the other stuff you\'ve done.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, come on. I\'ll drive you down to the mall.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah. I wanna see what you guys can do. And then we\'ll go buy you a small toy so that you can forget all about this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright! \'\'[father and son get up and leave the bedroom. Randy tosses his magazine aside]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Mall, afternoon.

Well, let\'s just walk away then. \'\'[man and woman leave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|God dammit!
