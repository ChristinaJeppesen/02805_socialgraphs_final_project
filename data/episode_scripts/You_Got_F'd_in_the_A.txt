Go Stan!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Oh no! \'\'[begins to cross the street]\'\' No, stop Stan! You don\'t know what you\'re doin\'!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The OC crew is speechless. The song ends.

Please. \'\'[leans to one side and whips his hair back into place]\'\' We don\'t dance like those Britney and Justin wannabes at school. \'\'[whips his hair back into place]\'\' Goth kids dance to express pain and suffering.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|Yeah. \'\'[stands up]\'\' The only cool way to dance is to keep your hands at your sides and your eyes looking at the ground. Then every three seconds you take a drag from your cigarette.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Michael leans his head to the right for two beats, leans it to the left for two beats, leans it to the right for two beats while taking a drag, leans it to the left for two beats, and repeats. The red Goth follows suit, then all four Goths dance the same way.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, that\'ll work fine. Listen, there\'s a dance competition this Saturday and I need good dancers so I don\'t get served.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|\'\'[flips his hair back]\'\' No way. Dancing is something you do alone in your room at three in the morning.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[walks up to the red Goth]\'\' Please, you guys, our whole town\'s reputation is at stake! Will any of you do it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pete|I\'m not doin\' it. Being in a dance group is totally conformist.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Henrietta|Yeah. I\'m not conforming to some dance-off regulations.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Firkle|I\'m not doin\' it either. I\'m the biggest nonconformist of all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|I\'m such a nonconformist that I\'m not going to conform with the rest of you.

There\'s this Asian kid named Yao. He\'s an expert at that Dance Dance Revolution game. \'\'[takes a drag from his cigarette]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Sinistarcade. A Dancin\' Dancin\' Dancin\' Machine game is prominently shown, and an Asian boy dances furiously on the foot pad on the right. The arrows indicate which foot buttons the boy should be stepping on. He\'s hit everyone, so his score is perfect. Stan and Michael look on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, he\'s incredible.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael|He should be. He\'s here playing that game every single day after school. I think he\'s spent about six thousand dollars on it so far. \'\'[the game gets faster and faster and the kid keeps up. Eventually, the game ends, and the boy picks up his soda cup and walks away.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[catches up to Yao at the change machine]\'\' Hey kid, you\'re pretty good. How would you like to join our dance troupe?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yao|You mean, dancing without a machine telling you what to do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yao|That\'s stupid. \'\'[waves him off and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[catches up]\'\' Dude, we need you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yao|I can\'t dance without the machine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s all right.

Inside the little waitresses go about their work. Two of them dance, shaking their asses in rhythmic unison. Mercedes dances for a boy, who looks on in bliss.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Porsche|Hi guys, welcome to Raisins. Three of you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ah actually we were just hoping we could talk to you guys real quick.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Maury|You have to buy wings if you wanna talk to the Raisins girls. \'\'[Stan look at his crew.

What kind of competition is it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s a dance-off. We heard you were tap dancing state champion two years ago. \'\'[his smile vanishes as he begins to think back, then a small grimace appears.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|...No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But, you were, weren\'t you? Y-you went to the nationals in Nebraska.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|No. \'\'[hops off the chair and runs away]\'\' No no no no no no, no! \'\'[runs into the living room and up the stairs]\'\' No!

Dude, don\'t be stupid! Those OC kids are professional dancers! Now come on, there\'s gotta be one other talented person in South Park.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' house, Butters\' bedroom closer door slides open and he looks in. On the floor, covered in cobwebs, and underneath some clothes is an orange shoe box with red lid. Butters slides the door open more and reaches in. He pulls out the box and sets it on his bed. He sits down next to it, nervously. Butters opens the box and pulls out news clippings: "Local Boy Taps His Way to the Finals" "Best in State Arrive in Lincoln" "Eight Dead as Finalist Loses Step" "Biggest Tap Tragedy since 1954". He then removes some tissue from the tap shoes, then removes a shoe. He inspects it until he sees the blood on the side of the shoe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Aaaaah! \'\'[quickly throws the shoes and clippings away, then goes to cry into his pillow]\'\' Aaaaah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A ranch.

The song begins to play, Butters begins to dance]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Singer| <poem>\'\'I\'ve got something in my front pocket for you\'\'\n\'\'Why don\'t you reach down in my pocket and see what it is\'\'\n\'\'Then grab onto it, it\'s just for you\'\'\n\'\'Give a little squeeze and say, "How do you do?"\'\'\n\'\'There\'s something in my front pocket, There\'s something in my front pocket,\'\'\n\'\'There\'s something in my front pocket-\'\' </poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|As the song reaches its climax, he dances faster and faster, until his right shoe flies off his foot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Whoops.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' shoe strikes a floodlight in the rafters and knocks it down. The light lands on a man, instantly killing him. Blood splatters onto the surrounding audience members, who get up and scatter. The rafters begin to break apart. A pole comes down and impales a fleeing woman. Her flying blood reaches Butters. More lights fall down and a cable is torn from its anchor, leaving a hole in the wall. The cable swings down and slices a couple in two along the abdomen. The upper halves of their bodies slide off and fall to the ground.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman|Paul. Paul!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The woman grabs onto the stage light and is electrocuted. Another man, who was sliced in two by the cable, attempts to gather his insides back into himself. The rafters come down and kill another man, and Paul\'s widow finally blows up. More blood lands on Butters, and the crowd begins to panic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wuuuhaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaah! \'\'[a man is trampled to death underfoot. Butters watches the auditorium empty out]\'\' No! Nooo! Noooooooooooooooo!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, day.

I wanna see what you kids can do!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Chef starts the CD player. The troupe members display their moves: Stan with the Achy Breaky Dance, Michael with the hanging head, Yao with his DDDM moves, Mercedes with her rump shaker, and Jeffy with his duck strut.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boombox|<poem>\'\'You can\'t step to my roots, so don\'t try it.\'\'\n\'\'You can’t burn with my group so don’t light it.\'\'\n\'\'I\'m on the East-side crew and I\'m better than you.\'\'\n\'\'You like to suck my balls, don\'t deny it.\'\'\n\'\'You can\'t bop her like me so don\'t go there.\'\'\n\'\'You never find a bigger bitch player nowhere.\'\'\n\'\'I put my jimmy in a ho, put off soul.\'\'\n\'\'I\'m a good listener and that\'s rare.\'\' </poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Oh Lord have mercy. \'\'[turns off the boombox]\'\' Children, children! No no, you\'ve got it all wrong. Don\'t you see, children? You have the heart, but you don\'t have the soul. No no, wait. You have the soul, but you don\'t have the heart. \'\'[scratches his head]\'\' No no, scratch that. You have the heart and the soul, but you don\'t have the talent.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'re gonna get served on Saturday, aren\'t we?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Yao|What? I don\'t wanna get served.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mercedes|Yeah, you didn\'t tell us that we might get served.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well that was the whole point of the whole thing was that the guys came back and they said we were gonna get served and we were like- \'\'[the others also speak, the others continue to argue, talking over one another.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|All right, all right, quiet, children! Now, nobody\'s getting served if I can help it. We just gotta buckle down, dig deep, and pray that maybe the other team comes down with cancer. \'\'[Stan droops his head.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Butters\' room. He\'s working on a Lego building, which might be a model of South Park. Stan enters and walks up to him. Butters glances back and then looks at his work again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|What do you want?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I came to ask you one more time to join the crew. Everyone is practicing really hard, but... I don\'t think we have any kind of shot without you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Sorry, Stan, I\'m not a dancer anymore. \'\'[leaves his chair and walks up to his Lego box]\'\' I gave that up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Your mom says you were one of the best dancers in the country.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[rummaging for Lego blocks to take back to his desk]\'\' Did she also tell you my dancing got eight people killed?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. She said your shoe came off. It wasn\'t your fault.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah well, you tell that to their families. \'\'[returns to his desk with a new batch of blocks]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, Butters, accidents happen. We all have to live with that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[whirls around]\'\' I let those people down! Don\'t you get it, man?! Eight people died!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, it was nine, actually. One of the women was pregnant.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|And eleven if you count the two family members that killed themselves afterward.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[cups his hear so he hears no more]\'\' Aaaah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But that isn\'t the point, Butters! \'\'[Butters resumes building his tiny town]\'\' The point is that this is now! It\'s on! And there are people who need you to step up! Look, nobody likes having to rise to a challenge. But competing against other people and getting in their faces saying "Haha! I\'m better than you!" is part of life. And if you can\'t face that, then you might as well sit here and play Legos until you\'re an old man.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Get out of my room, Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[Firmly]\'\' Fine. \'\'[walks to the door and opens it]\'\' But someday you\'re gonna have to stop running from what happened and start dealing with it. Otherwise, you might as well move to France with all the other pussies. \'\'[leaves and closes the door.

Can I still dance with you guys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Butters! \'\'[the SP crew moves towards him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|All right!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|MC|All right come on, let\'s do this! DJ!
