\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison\'s classroom. Oral Report Day. Tolkien is at the front of the class with a picture of all the planets rising over the moon on the roll-up screen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Pluto is also the furthest planet from the sun, though scientists believe more planets lie beyond it. I hope you enjoyed my report on the Solar System. Thank you. \'\'[the projector turns off and Tolkien takes his seat as Timmy claps a little]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Garrison|Okay, very nice, Tolkien. Thank you. \'K kids, looks like we only have time for one more speech today, so let\'s have uh Eric.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[walks up to the front of the class and turns around, looking at his paper]\'\' Thank you, Mrs. Garrison. \'\'[reads]\'\' My speech is entitled "Ginger Kids: Children with red hair, light skin, and freckles." \'\'[Stan and Kyle glance at each other]\'\' We\'ve all seen them - on the playground, at the store, walking on the streets - they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs. I\'m talking of course about... ginger kids. \'\'[cues up his pics. A red-headed boy appears]\'\' Aww sick! Gross! Ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin, red hair, and freckles. \'\'[next picture is of a girl licking her triple-scoop ice-cream cone]\'\' Aw, nasty! Yuck! \'\'[returns to his paper]\'\' This disease is called Gingervitus, and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[annoyed at Cartman\'s ignorance]\'\' What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured. \'\'[another redheaded girls pops up]\'\' Ah sick! \'\'[another redhead]\'\' Gross! \'\'[another redhead]\'\' Yeck! \'\'[returns to his paper]\'\' Because their skin is so light, ginger kids must avoid the sun. Not unlike... \'\'[a picture of a vampire with a full moon and bats behind him pops up]\'\' vampires.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Class|Aaaah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s not true, fatass! I have red hair, and I don\'t have to avoid the sun!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I was getting to that, if you will let me. \'\'[returns to his paper]\'\' Some people have red hair, but not light skin and freckles. These people are called "daywalkers." \'\'[cues up a picture of Kyle, with "daywalkers" written underneath]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh! Daywalkers!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|This is all a bunch of crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mrs. Garrison, I\'m really havin\' a difficult time with all these interruptions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Garrison|Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s not a presentation, it\'s a hate speech! People aren\'t creeped out by gingers!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|\'\'[glances around]\'\' I am.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Garrison|Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with \'\'your\'\' paper tomorrow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Fine, I will! \'\'[crosses his arms]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Fine! In the meantime, shut your Goddamned daywalker mouth! \'\'[Kyle grits his teeth and growls, trying to contain himself]\'\' Let\'s see, where was I? Oh yes! Like vampires, the ginger gene is a curse, \'\'[next picture: a boy with a few missing front teeth]\'\' and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse, the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time. It is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting. In conclusion, I will leave you with this: if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one, \'\'[the last pic is that of Carrot Top]\'\' think again. \'\'[the bell rings and the kids file out of the classroom.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stupid supremacist asswipe!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, what\'s the big deal?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What\'s the big deal? Don\'t you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to? I have to disprove Cartman\'s hateful rumors! Do you know any red-haired, freckled kids?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[thinks a moment]\'\' What about the Foley family? I think they\'re all ginger.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, day. Stan and Kyle walk up to a house. The front door opens and three redheads greet them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Three kids|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey. Wuh I\'m giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles. Can I ask you a few questions?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girl|\'\'[the middle child]\'\' Sure. Come on in. \'\'[waves them in. They enter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy|\'\'[the oldest child]\'\' Mom, Dad, these boys wanna know about us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|What? Heh, hello there, kids.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We... came to learn the facts about people with red hair, light skin and freckles.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|\'\'[nervous throughout]\'\' Oho, gingers, yes. Our cute little red-haired rascals.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m sorry, but I don\'t understand. You both have dark hair and brown eyes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|Yes, we\'ve learned that the ginger gene is recessive in both our families\' DNA. Actually, the odds of us having a red-haired freckled child were only one in four. And still it happened. Three times. What are the odds? \'\'[breaks down and sobs into his hands]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mother|A lot of people carry the ginger gene and don\'t know. \'\'[her husband stops sobbing and raises his head]\'\' If your spouse is also a carrier, then your children can turn out like... them. \'\'[they both look at the kids, who smile and grin]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|Each one of them\'s a blessing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mother|Oh yes, each one of them\'s a blessing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|Huh Blesse-blessing full of love.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Three kids|\'\'[grinning]\'\' Thanks, Mom and Dad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But it\'s... it\'s not true they... have no souls. \'\'[somber music plays]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|No... no, I\'m sure they do. \'\'[quickly rises and shows the boys to the door]\'\' Well it was nice meeting you boys. We\'ve gotta get dinner started.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I just had a couple more questions about-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father|Look, boys, if you really don\'t wanna have ginger kids, marry an Asian woman. Asians don\'t carry the recessive gene. \'\'[looks right and left]\'\' I know a guy who\'s marrying a Japanese woman very soon for just that reason. \'\'[closes the door on them and they turn around]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day, Mrs. Garrison\'s classroom. Second Oral Report Day. Kyle stands at the front of the class with an image of melanin\'s chemical structure.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And so, red hair, light skin, and freckles are all passed down genetically. A child\'s red hair is not determined by the lack of a \'\'soul\'\', \'\'[Cartman yawns]\'\' but by the melanins which control the pigment in all of our skins. Thank you. \'\'[turns off the projector and goes to his desk amid some applause]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mrs. Garrison|Okay, very nice, Kyle. A little dry and science-y for my taste, but there you go. \'\'[the bell rings]\'\' All right, that\'s lunch, kids. We\'ll pick up with Clyde\'s speech about lesbian cheerleaders after recess.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That was a very informative speech, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Thanks, Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Informative if you want to die. \'\'[hops off his seat and joins Butters and Kyle]\'\' Guys, don\'t forget. Kyle is a daywalker. Daywalkers are half-gingers themselves. Make no mistake: ginger kids are evil. You know who was ginger? Judas. And what did Judas do? Oh, he just got Jesus killed, that\'s all. \'\'[moves towards the door]\'\' Look, I\'m just saying what everyone else already thinks: Gingers are creepy. And one night, when you\'re all sleepin\' in your room, the gingers are gonna getcha. They\'re gonna GETCHA! \'\'[points at Clyde, who jumps back.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary hallway. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny walk towards the camera.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You buying school lunch today?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Nah, my mom packed me a kosher lunch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|\'\'[off screen]\'\' Right this way! \'\'[the camera shows four boys - Craig, Jimmy, Clyde and Tolkien - kicking a redhead out]\'\' You can\'t eat in the cafeteria! \'\'[Craig crosses his arms]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy|How come?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Ginger kids eat in the hallway!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Yeah. Go on, beat it, re... rr-retard! \'\'[the redhead walks off and the other four boys go back inside the cafeteria]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There! You see?! This is what happens when Cartman is allowed his right to free speech!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That\'s just wrong, dude. I wish Cartman could see what it felt like to be ginger.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[thinks]\'\' Hey. \'\'[snaps his fingers]\'\' That\'s a great idea!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(What\'s a great idea?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Can you guys meet me over at Cartman\'s house tonight at around midnight?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Sure, for what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re gonna teach that fat bastard a lesson!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, midnight. Cartman is snoring. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny pop up outside his window and open it. They climb in. Stan motions Kenny to Cartman\'s door, and Kenny walks over to close it. Stan quickly goes to Cartman\'s desk and takes out some makeup - skin bleach, hair color, henna kit - and some yellow latex gloves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay dude, knock him out. \'\'[Kyle takes out a small club and beats Cartman with it once. He looks at him angrily. His short temper got the best of him and starts beating him more. After five blows Stan rushes over to stop him]\'\' Dude, dude okay, he\'s out! \'\'[with the club gone, Kyle resorts to punching Cartman out]\'\' Kyle, that\'s good! \'\'[Kenny puts his ear to the door and listens for any activity in the hallway]\'\' All right, let\'s do it.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, morning. Liane, in her night robe, walks over to Cartman\'s room and knocks on the door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Eric honey, time to get up for school. \'\'[heads back to the kitchen downstairs. Cartman rolls over and wakes up, hops down and leaves his room]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman| \'\'-ed a fine time to leave me, Lucille\'\' <br />}}\n\'\'Four hungry children and a-\'\'\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|\'\'[hears him and drops the spatula]\'\' Poopsiekins! \'\'[rushes back to the restroom, leaving her eggs cooking.

Liane arrives and enters]\'\' Sweetie, what is the- \'\'[he turns around and she screams]\'\' AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'M GINGER!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh my God! Eric!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Help me! Hellp mee!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A hospital room. A doctor gives Cartman a check-up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|Well, all his vital signs are still normal. From his outward appearance, I would say he has the standard skin pigment deficiency.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|You mean...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|Yes, I\'m afraid that your son is suffering from gingervitus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|And how could I become a ginger now?! I wasn\'t born like this!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|Well, the red-haired and freckle gene is a recessive gene. It must\'ve stayed dormant in your system until you hit adolescence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|So I\'m gonna stay like this forever?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|\'\'[puts a hand on Cartman\'s back]\'\' I\'m sorry, son. \'\'[takes Liane aside]\'\' Ms. Cartman, could I have a word with you? \'\'[walks a few steps with Liane]\'\' Ms. Cartman, I know this must be... very difficult for you. I for one can\'t stand red-haired, freckled kids, but you need to understand, there is no cure. Your son will be ginger his whole life. You might want to just... put him down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh... \'\'[looks away. Cartman hops off the bed and walks up and stands between them.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Agh, excuse me, Doctor, but it just so happens my mom loves me, no matter what I look like! \'\'[crosses his arms]\'\' Right, Mom?! \'\'[a bit shocked when she doesn\'t answer right away]\'\' Mom?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|Oh ye-yes, of course,sweetie.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|All right, but... you\'re gonna have to take certain precautions now. It\'s very important that you keep Eric out of the sun. The sun... is his worst enemy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school bus stop, morning. Stan, Kyle and Kenny are waiting there, as usual. Cartman walks up with a blue umbrella open, shielding him from the sun.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey dudes, what\'s goin\' on? \'\'[coughs to clear his throat]\'\' How is everything with you guys?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wow, Cartman. You look... different.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, well, it\'s interesting you should point that out, Kyle. I went to the doctor yesterday, and apparently I suffer from a small skin pigment deficiency.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You mean,you\'re a ginger?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Actually, gingervitus is the medical term.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Is that an umbrella you\'re using?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, Kyle. \'\'[coughs]\'\' The sun\'s rays are bad for my skin, so I need to be protected when I\'m outside. Well, I\'m glad we\'ve gotten all that out of the way, and now we can just go on with our lives as normal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[looks at Stan for a moment]\'\' ...Wow, that\'s a little ironic, isn\'t it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What do you mean, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you \'\'are\'\' one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[thinks]\'\' Hm. I don\'t really see the irony in that, Kyle. \'\'[the school bus pulls up and opens its doors. The kids climb in and find seats]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school bus. Cartman sits next to Butters, who\'s taken aback at Cartman\'s new appearance. A few moments later, Butters begins to laugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s fine, just get it out of the way...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, this is going awesome.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Maybe he\'ll actually learn a lesson this time. \'\'[Butters strokes his nose, then takes out a napkin to wipe away tears from the laughter, then sighs, only to resume laughing, harder. Cartman just folds his arms across his chest and looks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school cafeteria. The kids are eating, but there\'s not a redhead to be seen in there... except for.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Walks up to an empty space between Clyde and Tolkien]\'\' Hey Clyde, Tolkien. Sup, Jim? \'\'[begins to eat]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|What are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m grubbin\'. What\'s it look like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|You\'re not supposed to be in the cafeteria.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|You know the rule. No ginger kids in the cafeteria.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But... it\'s me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Right. And you\'re a ginger. \'\'[at a nearby table, Stan is about to eat his burger, but Kyle softly jabs him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, check it out. \'\'[Stan looks over]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Guys! Okay, look, maybe I\'m ginger, but... I\'m not like other ginger kids. I\'m still me inside. \'\'[the camera looks around at the other kids at the table, who remain silent]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Sorry. If we let one ginger kid in here, then the others are gonna start coming.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Yeah, beat it, j... jackass. \'\'[Cartman is stunned, but takes his tray and walks away. He walks past Kyle, Stan, and Kenny.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We did it guys. We finally taught Cartman a lesson. I\'ll bet that now, Cartman is gonna have a long hard think about how he treated gingers.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The South Park Elementary Library. Cartman did indeed think long and hard about this, so now he\'s holding this meeting.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I want to thank everyone for showing up today. I\'ve called this meeting because, I don\'t know about you, but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against! Just because we have red hair, light skin and freckles, we\'re thought of as somehow less important, and it\'s bullcrap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boy|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kids at school laugh at us, doctors call us "genetically inferior." The world needs to know that we are people, with feelings! And our parents love us for who we are!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Older Boy|My dad says that each one of my freckles is a kiss from an angel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...Riiight, exactly! We can\'t let this go on any longer! We should be PROUD of who we are! Think about all the great people in history who were ginger. People like... \'\'[he can\'t think of any]\'\' Like uh... \'\'[looks up in thought, then softly]\'\' Liiike...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girl|Ron Howard?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Right! Ron Howard! And uh... Aaaaand...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Older Boy|Ron Howard? \'\'[the other redheads look at him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Right! We already had him, but right! See? Ginger people go on to do amazing things in society! We need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior! That we are in fact beautiful, totally awesome, and super-smart. It\'s time for us to take back our pride!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kids|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The playground, moments later. A girl chases a boy around. Stan, Kyle and Kenny play tetherball.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Red Power! \'\'[Stan stops the game and the boys look at the source of commotion. Cartman leads the gingers across the playground]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gingers|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gingers|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gingers|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gingers|Red Power!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We gingers are proud people!

A field reporter stands outside a theater, with a crowd milling around behind him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|Tom, I\'m standing outside the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, where the new production of "Annie" has just premiered to cries of outrage. \'\'[a shot of gingers with Cartman front and center]\'\' A rapidly-growing organization called The Ginger Separatist Movement is furious that the lead role of Annie \'\'[shown, in character]\'\' is being played by a girl \'\'[shown in regular clothes and real hair]\'\' who isn\'t actually red-haired and freckled. Joining me now is the gingers\' head spokesperson, Eric Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s right! This is bullcrap! We True Gingers are furious that the role of Annie is being minimalized!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|What harm do you believe this actress is doing to the true red-haired community?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|The bitch isn\'t ginger! She\'s just using makeup to look ginger! And pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gingers|Yeah!

Get her! \'\'[the gingers rush her and start ganging up on her]\'\' Die, you stupid bitch!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|This is getting pretty ugly, Tom. These gingers are really riled up!

Feels good to be proud of who you are! Now I don\'t think I need to tell you there\'s a lot of hate out there. Hate for awesome people like us.

We are not the freaks of society, everyone else is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gingers|Yeah!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Gingers are the chosen people! The chosen race!

Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Because now he\'s acting like gingers are awesome. And all his friends are gingers.

The three boys walk towards Cartman\'s house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You know, Cartman is an uncaring, bigoted intolerant asshole, but I have to admit, I had my own prejudice about gingers.
