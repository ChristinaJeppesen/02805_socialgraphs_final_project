We only have two months before Christmas.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Mr. Hankey, we called you in to let you know that... your Christmas Pageant funding has been cut. By half.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Hankey|What? But I can barely make a good Christmas show with what I have!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|We just don\'t have the support for the Christmas show that we used to.

Thank you, Mr. Hankey, and good luck with the show.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. Another school shooting has occurred and the police are back to investigate.

Kids, the song\'s called "Deck The Halls," not "Let\'s All Suck Balls."

The vice principal has asked to speak with you today. She believes it is time that we all as a school finally discussed in-vitro fertilization.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Strong Woman|That\'s right, kids. Many women today make the choice to have children without a man in their lives. They can have their eggs fertilized by an unknown person\'s sperm in a lab.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|That\'s right, Strong Woman. In today\'s society it is wrong to just assume that a pregnant woman had intercourse with a man.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Strong Woman|\'\'[doubles over in pain]\'\' Ooohhhhhhh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|St-students at this school need to be careful because it can be offensive to ask questions like "Who\'s the father?"}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Strong Woman|\'\'[doubles over in pain]\'\' Oh!

Listen, if you\'re tired and you can\'t sleep, DO NOT take Ambien. Okay?

I made a mistake and I am MOVING FORWARD!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The law offices of Mayer, Schulz, and Tate, day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Hankey|My civil rights are under attack. They can\'t just fire me from the Christmas show! The whole thing is my creation!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Male Lawyer|Uh, last night you tweeted "The city council can suck my Mexican dick."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Hankey|It was a joke. Look at me! I don\'t even have a dick! Get it? \'\'[no reaction from the lawyers]\'\' Okay, okay, look, I know: it wasn\'t a good joke. But it really wasn\'t my fault. The fact is, I went home last night and I was angry. I couldn\'t sleep, so I took some Ambien. And then I started tweeting. Ambien messes with my head. You ever take that crap?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Female lawyer|You want us to take this up against Ambien?
