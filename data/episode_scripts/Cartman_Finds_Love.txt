And she\'s joined the cheerleading squad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Oh, we have a new cheerleader?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|What\'s she look like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah, what\'s her name?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[taking control of the situation]\'\' Alright guys, alright! If there is a new girl at our school, we\'re not gonna start putting claims on her and getting into big fights! It\'s gonna be her choice who she likes the most.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school gym, moments later. Some double doors are open and Butters peeks in. The other boys gather behind him, and soon all their jaws drop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Look, look, there she is. \'\'[near the bleachers opposite the doors are five girls: Red, Wendy, Bebe, Lola, and Jenny. Between Wendy and Bebe are two pompoms waiting for a sixth cheerleader, who arrives shortly. It\'s a black girl. The other five girls begin talking to her all at once]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my God. Tolkien, aren\'t you stoked? \'\'[Tolkien looks over at him.

Oh my God, that is adorable.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fourth Grade class, some time later. Mr. Garrison is at the blackboard teaching the class about Game of Thrones}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|And so what we start to see now is a pattern in world history much like the Greeks and the Romans. Remember that there were seven families fighting for control of the land of Westeroth. The king of Westeroth was who? Robert Baratheon \'\'[circles BARATHEON on the board]\'\', and he asked Eddard, also known as, of course, Lord Stark, to serve as hand of the king. You remember that Lord Stark accepted, or course. The queen\'s family - that\'s the Lannisters - were really trying back then to take control, weren\'t they? So where were the Targaryens at this time? Well, they were across the sea. We all talked about how they were also trying to take the throne. So we\'ve got the Greeks, the Romans, the Starks, Lannisters, Baratheons, Targaryens, all headed for a big blowout right in Season 2. Now, what I really wanted to get into today is what was going on in the north, because that\'s just a whole other mess- \'\'[during the lecture, the following takes place]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[fairly whispering throughout, beginning when Mr. Garrison mentions Lord Stark. He sits between Tolkien and the new girl and grins as he looks at each of them by turn]\'\' Dude... Tolkien! \'\'[jerks his head a bit in the girl\'s direction and points at her]\'\' Tolkien. Dude. \'\'[Tolkien looks at him, then goes back to taking notes. Cartman smiles]\'\' Psst. Tolkien. \'\'[points to the girl again, but puts his right hand up so she doesn\'t notice. Tolkien is annoyed]\'\' Go ahead. Go ahead dude. Tolkien! Yeah, get in there.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[annoyed as well]\'\' Will you shut the hell up?! \'\'[goes back to taking notes. Cartman finally picks up his pen, but doesn\'t write anything]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|...Tolkien. You want me to pass her a jelly bean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[whispers back]\'\' No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[louder]\'\' No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|\'\'[stops talking and turns to the class]\'\' Tolkien, is there a problem? \'\'[Tolkien is a loss for words, but Cartman fields this question]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ah, he\'s just a little sick, Mr. Garrison. He\'s got boneritis. \'\'[begins to laugh at his own joke]\'\' Right guys? \'\'[tries to hold the laugh in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Everyone pay attention! \'\'[goes back to the board]\'\' Now, what I really wanna get into today is what was going on in the north, because that\'s just a whole other mess that\'s pretty hard to keep straight, isn\'t it? The Night\'s Watch- \'\'[while Garrison resumes his lesson, Cartman resumes his prodding]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[quickly looks at the girl and at Tolkien]\'\' Tolkien. \'\'[leans back in his seat so Tolkien has a clear view of the girl]\'\' Dude, dude. Dude.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, hallway. Bebe and Red are at Bebe\'s locker, talking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|So then Kelly I guess told Stacey that she wasn\'t invited, so now Stacey\'s pissed at us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[approaching]\'\' Hey, guys? Can I talk to you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[shuts her locker]\'\' Why?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[motions to his left]\'\' Just, can I talk to you, real quick? \'\'[walks the girls over to the end of the hallway]\'\' What kind of stuff is the new girl saying about Tolkien?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|About Tolkien? Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, Tolkien\'s really shy, so, I\'m just here, sort of on his behalf \'cause, you know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Tolkien likes Nichole?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, of course. \'\'[the girls look at each other]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|Oh yeah, I don\'t think she has any idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, so, could you guys just let her know that, you know, she might have to make the first move?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Thanks, you guys.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Bebe\'s basement, day. She and the other five cheerleaders are playing the board game, Living.

I dated him for a little while. \'\'[the other girls chime in, showing their support. The camera pulls back a bit, and Cartman is shown eavesdropping just outside a basement window]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Oh jeez, thanks you guys, but to be totally honest, I kinda think this other boy is cute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[excited]\'\' Who? Whowhowhowho?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|That kid, with the orange coat and the green hat?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Oh, you mean Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Girls|Ooooh, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|WHAT?!

It\'s just a crush. \'\'[the girls laugh while Cartman gets livid]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Motherfucker! \'\'[gets up and runs off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, next day. The girls are practicing on the football field as three random boys watch from the bleachers}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The Girls|We are Cows, proud and true! Count on South Park, moo moo moo!

Um, there\'s something you should probably know. \'\'[fakes a sweat]\'\' Oh man this is hard. Um, the thing is, me and Kyle are kind of, you know ...together?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Ohhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, he\'s my man. I\'m more out than Kyle is, but... it sucks, because he acts like we\'re not a couple at school because he\'s embarrassed, but... we get home and he\'s the best boyfriend I\'ve ever had.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Wow, I-I\'m sorry. I totally respect that. \'\'[puts her right hand on his left shoulder]\'\' Hey, thanks a lot for telling me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Cool, just, you know, don\'t touch me \'cause I\'m not into girls, so it kind of grosses me out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|\'\'[withdraws her hand]\'\' Oh, I\'m sorry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, kewl. Anyway, thanks a lot and just, you know, stay away from my man, bitch. \'\'[snaps his fingers and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The hallway, later. Kyle is at his locker putting some books away. Nichole approaches him}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know, if you ever need somebody to talk to, I\'m here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh, thanks. \'\'[smiles. Nichole turns and walks away, smiling. Kyle sees Craig and Timmy nearby and runs towards them]\'\' Dude, that new girl\'s into me!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Another hallway. Cartman hides around the corner and makes like he\'s real cool, wearing shades and with hands in his jacket pockets, one foot resting on the wall. Butters walks past him on the cross-hallway without noticing}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Psst Butters. Butters! \'\'[Butters stops and notices, then walks over to Cartman]\'\' At the end of PE class, tell Nichole that the gym teacher wants some towels delivered to the boys\' locker room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|How come?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[takes off his shades]\'\' Let\'s just say that by this time tomorrow, Tolkien and Nichole are gonna be practically married.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Are you sure, Eric? I mean, maybe they just aren\'t meant for each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No no. \'\'[walks him towards the camera]\'\' Love is like taking a dump, Butters. Sometimes it works itself out, but sometimes, you\'ve gotta give it a nice hard slimy push.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The football field, after PE.

Coach wants you to take these to the boys\' locker room. \'\'[hands her the towels]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Oh, he does? \'\'[Butters nods]\'\' Okay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The boys\' locker room.

It\'s the Bat-Mobile! Bat-Mobile, you guys! \'\'[the boys make a break for the front of the school and exit the front doors]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|In front of the school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Where?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|I-I don\'t see a b-b-Bat-Mobile.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at the gym, Nichole reaches the boys\' locker room, opens the door, and backs into the room.

He has a chain and lock with him, and as soon as the door closes he goes and locks them with the chain}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|\'\'[keeps walking, unaware of what Cartman just did]\'\' Hello??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[walks in dressed in a towel and drying his face with another]\'\' AAA!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|OH! Oh gosh I\'m so sorry!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Where is everybody? What\'s goin\' on??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Coach wanted me to... \'\'[winces and gets embarrassed]\'\' I\'m sorry. \'\'[drops the towels, turns and goes back to the doors.

Do you know?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lola|She likes... movies, cats.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jenny|\'\'[to Lola]\'\' She likes basketball.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ogh. Oh cool, she likes basketball?

Uh, can\'t right now, but maybe another time. See ya! \'\'[runs off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jenny|Guess he has a crush on Nichole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lola|\'\'[looks away for a moment]\'\' I don\'t think so.

They grin and wave back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back in the locker room, Tolkien tries to get himself and Nichole out, but groans and doesn\'t get anywhere}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Hey! In here! \'\'[punches the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|You think the janitors are still here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Don\'t worry. It\'s gonna be okay.

And massage oil.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Oh... Good.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school, just after sunrise. Firefighters have arrived at the locker room and have snapped the chain in two with bolt cutters.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The school, out front. The firefighters have taken Tolkien and Nichole outside and left them alone as they leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Well that was sure an interesting night.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|It sure was.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Nichole|Hey, thanks a lot for making me feel safe in there.
