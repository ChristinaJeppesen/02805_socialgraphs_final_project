Be warned: all scenes will be accompanied by pictures of Barbra Streisand.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A scream is heard and the Halloween/"Pinkeye" opening sequence is shown.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outer Space. A alien ship descends, and then turns towards Earth, headed for the western U.S. As it enters the atmosphere it begins to burn. It slows down and hovers over a road, then lands gently. A door opens like a camera lens, and an alien drops down. As soon as he moves, a tire crushes him. Judging by the size of the tire, the alien was 18 to 24 inches tall. The tire is that of the South Park Elementary school bus, which stops to let the boys off. Then it pulls away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I wonder why Cartman wasn\'t in school today.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He probably just ditched to avoid that spelling test.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey guys.

We\'re all gonna go meet at the store later to buy pumpkins to carve.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Excited.]\'\' Oooh, then we can enter the carving contest! I\'ll run home and get money from Mother. Do you guys need some, too?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman and the boys look at each other.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, this is creepy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house. Stan walks in to find Sharon and someone new.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley? Look who\'s here.

Hey, I love Aunt Flo!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He rushes in, Shelly turning up as well.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|Okay, Shelly. This one\'s for you.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Shelly opens up the larger box and it expands out into.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|It\'s a television/CD player/surround sound home theater.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|What do you say, Shelly?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Thank you, Aunt Flo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Okay, Stanley.

Let\'s hook up your home theater.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Okay.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Shelly follows her aunt out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|How do you like your fish, Stanley?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I \'\'don\'t\'\' like it.

If I had money, I wouldn\'t give it to \'\'you\'\' assholes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, at least he\'s back to normal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, but we can\'t get a pumpkin, so we can\'t enter the carving contest!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s okay. Kenny said \'\'he\'d\'\' get one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, how\'s Kenny gonna get one?! He\'s \'\'hella\'\' poor!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Why do you keep saying "hella", fatass?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'Cause I\'m \'\'hella\'\' cool, that\'s why.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s not cool!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys are just hella jealous.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Night time, storm.

We\'ll uh see you in the morning.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Can you leave the light on, Dad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, it has to be off, or your Aunt Flo will complain about wasting electricity.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I wish Aunt Flo didn\'t have to visit now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, me too. But she only visits your mom for five days or so. I\'ll be out sleeping on the couch. \'\'[turns the light off and closes the door]\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|In the darkness, Stan pulls the covers close and looks at the fish. They stare at each other, and the fish blows a bubble. Stan turns away, then looks back. The fish just looks at him. Stan then turns towards the window and begins to fall asleep, until lightning startles him upright. He looks at the tank. The fish is gone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Where did it go? \'\'[he lifts the covers and looks under the bed, then sits back. The fish swims back into view.]\'\' Huhhh. \'\'[he gets out, picks up his shirt, and throws it over the tank. He goes back to bed and looks at the tank again.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny\'s house. Rain is dripping in all over the ceiling as pails collect the water. Kenny, Kevin and Mom share a blanket on the sofa while Stuart sits in the armchair.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Give me that-!) \'\'[pulls the blanket off Kevin]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|Kenny \'\'[paf]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Ow, mom!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|You share that blanket with your brother! \'\'[knock knock knock]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Who the hell could that be? \'\'[the front door opens and the family looks to see who it is]\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[with mustache and beard, and dressed in raingear]\'\' Hi there, folks! This is a heck of a storm out now! Thought maybe you could use some provisions. \'\'[a box of SUPPLIES is next to him. The parents look at each other]\'\' There\'s some candles and food in there. It ain\'t much, but it should get you through the night. Take care, folks. I\'ve got other houses to get to. \'\'[walks off]\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|\'\'[suspicious]\'\' Kenny, wasn\'t that your fat, racist, foul-mouthed friend, Eric Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Uh huh.)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house. He gets up once again to look at the tank, but the shirt is not on it anymore.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey. Where did the shirt go? \'\'[hops off and approaches the fish]\'\' I covered you with a shirt! Where did it go?! \'\'[the fish blinks, then looks down and to the right. Stan\'s eyes follow, and he sees the shirt.]\'\' AAAaAaAaAa \'\'[runs back to his bed and pulls the covers up, then drops them a bit. He looks at the fish]\'\' I\'m not gonna look. \'\'[shuts his eyes, then opens them again. The fish tank, and the dresser it\'s on, are closer to the bed]\'\' It\'s not closer. I\'m just seeing things. \'\'[shuts his eyes again, then opens them. The tank and dresser are at the foot of his bed]\'\' GAAAH! \'\'[shuts his eyes tight, and opens them one more time. The fish tank is now on the bed, between his feet]\'\' AAAAAAAH!! \'\'[he jumps off, runs to his door, and rushes into the hallway]\'\' MOM! Mom! \'\'[comes back to the room with her in tow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley, settle down!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look. He\'s gonna kill me, Mom!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|\'\'[at the door]\'\' Is there a problem? \'\'[walks to Sharon]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Uh, no problem, Aunt Flo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|Do you not like your goldfish?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|I\'m sorry. I\'m a bad aunt. \'\'[buries her face in her hand and begins to sob.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|There, there, Aunt Flo. Stanley \'\'loves\'\' his goldfish. \'\'[he merely looks up at them]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|1:25 a.m. Stan is under the covers looking at the spooky fish. After a long while, the fish turns around and starts writing something on the tank wall with his tail. Stan gets out of bed for a closer look. The fish finishes writing and turns to blow on the wall. A gray area appears and the word "KILL" appears within it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|AAAAAAAAH! \'\'[runs back to bed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[enters his room and turns on the lights]\'\' Stanley, what are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[pointing]\'\' The fish! \'\'[nothing is left of the writing on the tank wall]\'\' But-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley, I\'m in no mood for this! Not when your Aunt Flo is in town! Oh, look, you woke your sister up. \'\'[Shelly stands in front of Sharon, then approaches Stan and slaps him, then leaves the room]\'\' Go to sleep, Stanley! \'\'[turns off the light and closes the door behind her.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan gets back into bed and pulls the covers up. Another flash of lighting gets Stan to sit up again. He looks at the tank again, then gets out of bed for a closer look, failing to notice the growing pool of blood next to him. The fish again looks down and to the right, and Stan\'s eyes follow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[gasps. A man lies dead between the tank and the bed]\'\' WAAAAAAAH! Mooomm!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|All right, Stanley. I have had enough o- \'\'[freezes when she sees the body, then, quivering]\'\' Oh, Stanley, what have you done, baby? What have you done?? \'\'[rushes to comfort him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mom, I was just sleeping. And the next thing I knew-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[covers his mouth with her arm, then quietly]\'\' Sshhh. It\'s okay, honey. It\'s okay. I\'ve got such a good boy, Mommy\'s little angel. \'\'[kisses him and gets up]\'\' Now, don\'t worry, Stanley. Mommy\'s going to hide the body. \'\'[starts to drag it away]\'\' Nobody\'s going to take my baby away. I\'ve got such a handsome boy, such a good boy. \'\'[she drags the body out of the room and out into the storm. Stan just looks at her]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[turns to the fish]\'\' You\'re not gonna get away with this! \'\'[the fish writes again, blows, and the message is: "Yes I Will."]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan walks over to the window and sees his mom digging a grave next to the body. She then places the body in the grave and covers it up. She returns with the shovel to the kitchen and closes the door behind her.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|\'\'[her silhouette appears]\'\' Sharon!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|D\'uh! Aunt Flo, what are \'\'you\'\' doing up?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aunt Flo|Look at you, with your little shovel.

It\'s going to be okay, Stanley.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mom, do you think \'\'I\'\' killed that guy? It was the \'\'fish\'\'! He says I\'m next!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The fish blinks and blows a bubble.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[enters the room]\'\' Now get some sleep, baby.

A rooster crows and Stan\'s clock farts. Stan wakes up and looks at the tank. The fish is still there. Stan hops off the bed and walks to the tank, but is stopped by another body.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|MMOOMM!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[frantic]\'\' What is it, honey? \'\'[gasp!]\'\' My baby\'s killed again!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[points at the body, then holds up his hands]\'\' No, mom!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[holds him tight]\'\' What are we gonna do, baby? What are we gonna do?? \'\'[the fish looks on. Sharon drags the body out]\'\' I\'ve got such a handsome boy, such a good boy.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan then stands at the window. As he looks out, a reflection of Sharon burying the body is seen on the window pane.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Almost 8 p.m., Kyle\'s house. Kyle and Cartman are at table when Kenny comes in}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s about time, Kenny! Did you bring the pumpkin?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Uh huh!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, where is it? \'\'[Kenny brings out a squash and sets it on the table]\'\' What the hell is that?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(It\'s the only thing I could afford.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s all you could afford?!

Sigh]\'\' God, I hate you, Kenny. \'\'[works on the squash some more]\'\' I have to get another knife; this one\'s hella dull! \'\'[goes into the kitchen for another one]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'God, will you shut up?!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle, you know how some people are, like, murderers and stuff?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Do you think animals can be murderers, too?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I don\'t know. \'\'[the bearded Cartman comes in with a huge knife]\'\' Oh, great. He\'s got that stupid beard on again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[gives Kenny a hand]\'\' No, Kenny. You should cut with the blade facing away from you. You\'re gonna hurt yourself.

Stan just got a new goldfish and he wanted to show it to Kenny but, Kenny never came over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|\'\'[cradling Stan, distraught]\'\' My Kenny used to laugh and play. He was eight years old, just like you, my Kenny was.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|You\'ve gotta tell me \'\'what happened to him\'\'! \'\'[holds Stan up and throttles him]\'\' You have to know something!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[intervening]\'\' Mrs. McCormick, I\'m going to have to ask you to leave! You\'ve been drinking!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|That\'s right, I\'m a little drunk. \'\'[Sharon escorts her to the door]\'\' You\'d be drunk, too, if you\'d lost your boy. \'\'[Evil Cartman enters as the women reach the door]\'\' My Kenny used to sing and dance, eh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Evil Cartman|\'\'[at the sofa]\'\' You guys, I found the pet store!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, let\'s go! \'\'[takes the fish with him and stops before Sharon]\'\' Mom, I know you think I did all this, but I\'m gonna prove to you it was this fucking fish!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|I believe you, sweetheart. \'\'[Stan goes outside, and she addresses Kyle and Evil Cartman]\'\' Run from him, boys. Run and don\'t stop!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A stormy night, at the pet store. The remains of a covered wagon are next to it.

First I dug up all the bodies, pissed on \'em, then buried them again upside down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|Why? I don\'t know. I was drunk.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We think that when you did that, you opened up a doorway to an evil, parallel universe.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|Well, that certainly would explain a lot.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Like what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|Well, like this. \'\'[opens a door marked, "Employees Only." A bright, flashing portal appears]\'\' I\'ve been wondering what the hell this was.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house.

Sharon makes more cookies]\'\' Sh-sharon, why\'d you take his- pants off?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[sobs.

Uh, well, don\'t- think of it as an end, think of it as a new beginning. Now, could you fill me in on the dead bodies and captive policeman stuff real quick?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at the pet store.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, pal. This is very simple. All I want to do is return this fish.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|I can\'t give you your money back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t care, dude! I just want this fish away from me!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|No! I won\'t take it back!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Evil Cartman|Listen, friend. You can\'t sell people pets like this. You have to have a sign that says, "Warning: these fish are from an evil, parallel universe." Now, it\'s not our fault you disrespected the bodies of this land\'s native people, but by golly \'\'[pounds his right hand with his left fist]\'\', you\'re gonna take this fish back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|All right, you win.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow!

You don\'t say, "hella," like \'\'our\'\' Cartman does. I swear, if he says that one more time, I\'m gonna \'\'kill\'\' him! \'\'[the boys exit the store, and the skies are clear]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Evil Cartman|No, Kyle. Murder is never an answer. \'\'[the clerk puts the fish up on a shelf and the employee door opens, the doorway glowing brightly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|\'\'[recoils]\'\' What the-? \'\'[two figures appear: Evil Stan and Evil Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Evil Stan|He was here! Cartman was just here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|Who are you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Evil Kyle|We\'re looking for Cartman. The trail ended here. Where is he?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|I don\'t know who you mean?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Evil Kyle|\'\'[pulls out a big bat]\'\' Maybe this will jog your memory! \'\'[starts releasing the evil returns by bashing in the cages]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clerk|No! Stop! You don\'t know what you\'re doing! Those pets are evil!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Several identical images of Barbra flash through space, one of them towards the camera, and the boys are walking down Main Street.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'m sure glad that\'s over with.
