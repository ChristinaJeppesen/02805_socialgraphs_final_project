The school bell rings}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Alright, children, in lieu of the common usage, I\'m s\'posed to clarify the school\'s position on the word, "shit".}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow! We can say "shit" in school now?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|This is ridiculous! Just because they say it on TV it\'s alright.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|Yes, but only in the figurative noun form or the adjective form.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[quizzically]\'\' Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Choksondik|You can only use it in the non-literal sense. For instance, \'\'[turns and writes on the board]\'\' "That\'s a shitty picture of me." is now fine.

For example: \'\'[writes]\'\' "The weather outside is shitty." However, the literal adjective is not appropriate.

You can say "I have to poop and shit," or "Oh, shit, I have to poop," but not "I have to shit." Are we all clear?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kindergartners|No.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Look, it\'s all about context. Well, for example, recently, I have come out and admitted that I was a homosexual. I\'m gay. That means that now \'\'I\'\' can say the word, "fag". On television they usually don\'t allow "fag". But because I\'m gay, it\'s alright. And with the new approval of the word, "shit," that means that finally \'\'I\'\' am free to say,<poem><i>\nHey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,\nShitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?\nHey, there, shitty shitty fag fag,\nShitty shitty fag fag, how do you do?</i></poem>\n\'\'[pleased]\'\' Oh this is great!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, some days later.
