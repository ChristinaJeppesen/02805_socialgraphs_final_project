I don\'t know what it is.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|Well basically, a lot of amazing studies have shown that stem cells might be used to fight cancer and a myriad of other diseases.

And if you sign a release, that tissue can go to studies.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Sanders|Oh well, I suppose, if it can help others.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|The hope is that someday it might. \'\'[hands her the release form and she signs it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ms. Sanders|Well okay. \'\'[hands the form back to him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Doctor|Great. \'\'[puts the form inside the cart]\'\' Well, here we go. \'\'[puts on his gloves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hallway outside operating room.

Why can\'t God take someone else\'s f-f-friend?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|\'\'[sighs]\'\' Stan, sometimes God takes those closest to us, because it makes him feel better about himself. He is a very vengeful God, Stan. He\'s all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago. He just can\'t get over it, so he doesn\'t care who he takes. Children, puppies, it don\'t matter to him, so long as it makes us sad. Do you understand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But then, why does God give us anything to start with?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Well, look at it this way: if you want to make a baby cry, first you give it a lollipop. Then you take it away. If you never give it a lollipop to begin with, then it would have nothin\' to cry about. That\'s like God, who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry, so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears. You see, it\'s our tears, Stan, that give God his great power. \'\'[pause]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I think I understand.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Capitol Hill, Washington DC}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|My name is Eric Cartman and I live in Colorado.

All I know is that if there\'s a chance, a... chance that stem-cell research could save my best friend\'s life, well... I guess I owe it to him to try and change your minds. \'\'[a shot of Congress]\'\' I love Kenny McCormick and... \'\'[sob]\'\' I want you to love him too. \'\'[cries as Congresspeople look to each other]\'\' And I uh, I\'m not the best speaker in the world.
