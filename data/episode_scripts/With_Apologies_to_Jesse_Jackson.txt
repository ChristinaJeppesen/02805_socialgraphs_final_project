The kids have gathered to see Cartman and Mr. Nelson fight.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|C\'mon now Eric, come on now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, are you sure you wanna do this? Apparently this guy has a black belt in karate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It\'s a midget, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Nelson|\'\'["Down with the Sickness" by Disturbed starts playing]\'\' Students, I am going to beat the crap out of this kid to prove a point.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hahaha, no- no dude.

Randy is addressing the senators.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Senators, I know it is not normally considered "American" to ban words. \'\'[Randy is flanked by Fuhrman and Richards]\'\' But there is one slur that has caused so much damage that we believe it should finally be made illegal. I\'m talking, of course, about the term "ni**er guy".}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Senator 1|"Ni**er guy"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together... form a verbal missile of hate.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richards|Yeah! That\'s right!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh sure. Some people just use the term in jest - tell a ni**er guy joke or two thinking it\'s no big deal - but they don\'t realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skeeter|\'\'[with his two friends]\'\' Goddamn ni**er guy\'s tryin\' to be all political-like now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Senators, I\'ve learned to admit that I\'m capable of having- slightly racist thoughts once in a while. Can anybody say they never do? How long will it be before you are all called "ni**er guys"? \'\'[the senators are somewhat shocked]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Senator 2|Uhhh, hold on a second, are you suggesting that "ni**er guy" could become a slur that refers to all white people?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Senator 3|I\'m certainly not a ni**er guy.

I don\'t get it. I\'ve been trying to say that I understand how you feel, but, I\'ll never understand. I\'ll never really get how it feels for a black person to have somebody use the N word.
