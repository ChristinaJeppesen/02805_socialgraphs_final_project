\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s basement, afternoon. The fourth grade boys are seated at a large conference table. Stan and Kyle come down the stairs and see the rest of the boys. At table are, counterclockwise, Clyde, Kevin, Tolkien, Craig, Bradley, Butters, a black-haired boy, Timmy, Francis, Tweek, and Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What are all you guys doing here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|I don\'t know. I got this emergency letter from Cartman that said to meet in his basement. \'\'[shows letter]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, us too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|[\'\'closes the door and comes downstairs\'\'] Ah, gentlemen, thank you for coming. We don\'t have a lot of time, so I\'ll cut to the chase. The girls at our school have been hiding something from us, hiding something huge.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What if I were to tell you that the girls have a device, which allows them to see... into the future.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|How do you know?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|The girls do not have a device that shows them the future Cartman. That\'s retarded.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|\'\'[in an English accent. Cartman looks on, startled]\'\' YOU, SIR, MOCKED CARTMAN BEFORE, YET YOU TWO SIT HERE DEMANDING ANSWERS! \'\'[bangs on the table twice with his fist]\'\' NOW \'\'DAMN\'\' YOU, LET HIM \'\'SPEAK\'\'!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Thank you, Clyde. Uh, I\'m afraid it\'s true. \'\'[pulls TV from the back]\'\' I secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my Wellington Bear video camera \'\'[shows the camera]\'\'. I caught the following images on tape. I warn you, this images maybe be too shocking for young children.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Okay. I\'m not lookin\'. \'\'[buries his face in his arms]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Video playback initialized. \'\'[presses play on the remote control and the screen shows the girls playing]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|School yard, playing on the TV}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girls|\'\'[laugh]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Okay, okay. My turn, do me now!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Isla|Okay Bebe. What do you want to know?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|I want to know if I\'m gonna live in a big mansion in the future.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Isla|Okay, let\'s find out. Ready? \'\'[pulls out a paper fortune teller]\'\' Pick a number.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Four.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Isla|One, two, three, four. Okay, pick a color.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|Blue.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Isla|B-L-U-E. All right pick another color}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|\'\'[off-screen]\'\' Red.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Isla|\'Kaaay. Okay, will Bebe live in a big mansion in the future? \'\'[opens an interior flap]\'\' Definitely yes!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bebe|All right!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Girls|Woohoo! You rock, Bebe!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|Whoa! Wow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|Do me next. I wanna know if I\'m gonna marry somebody cute.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|I\'ll do it! I\'ll do it! \'\'[takes the teller from the Isla]\'\' Pick a number.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|Three.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|One, two, three. Now, pick a color.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Where did they get that thing? \'\'[Kyle shushes him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|G-R-E-E-N.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|Now blue!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Heidi|The answer is no. \'\'[girls laugh at her]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|Aw dangit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my God, how does it know the answer?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|I... don\'t believe it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Believe it. The girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer. Freeze image! \'\'[presses the pause button]\'\' Gentlemen, we have to get our hands on that device.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s backyard. The boys set up a containment tent. Tolkien, Jason, and Kenny use pulleys to pull up the tent curtains. Craig and Bradley pull up a chalkboard with pictures of the girls. Someone rolls out the blueprints of the future telling device. The boy with the blue cap carries a box of equipment over to somewhere. The boys do other various tasks, Francis is at another computer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[comes to Clyde and Kevin\'s table]\'\' How is the incubation shield coming Clyde?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|It\'s all set. Once we have the device, it can be housed in here safely until we know what we\'re dealing with.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Good man. \'\'[goes over to the computer Kyle, Stan, and Tolkien are working on]\'\' Any luck here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|The outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals. Inside are colors... which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Good. Keep working. We want to know all we can before we try to operate it. \'\'[moves to the middle of the tent]\'\' All right, gentlemen, our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete. All that\'s left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Let\'s go take it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Don\'t be a fool, Craig. Do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So what do you suggest?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Heidi Turner \'\'[turns on a projector on which is shown her picture]\'\' is going to have a slumber party on Thursday night. There\'s no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the future-telling device there. If we... can get somebody invited to that slumber party, not only can we get a hold of the device, but find out how to use it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, there\'s just one problem: a boy can\'t go to a chicks\' slumber party.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, not a boy, but a girl. One of us is gonna have to go undercover, show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kevin|You mean like that movie, \'\'Juwanna Mann\'\'?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, not like \'\'Juwanna Mann\'\', Kevin, okay? It\'s way cooler than that!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class, the girls will wonder where that boy went.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Which is why we have to fake that boy\'s death. It\'s simple spy stuff, my friends. Take your top man, fake his death, then send him in disguised as the enemy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s a pretty solid idea. But who?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Stotch house, night. A police stops and two police officers arrive at the front door and knock the door}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 1|Mr. and Mrs. Stotch?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|Yes?

You have too much to live for! \'\'[a patrol car pulls up with Stephen and Linda]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|Oh my God, Butters!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh uh, hi Mom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[behind Butters]\'\' Just keep stalling, Butters. We don\'t have the dead pig quite ready yet. \'\'[Clyde, Stan, and Craig dress the pig while Cartman makes a Butter mask for it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|\'\'[grabs the bullhorn from the officer]\'\' Butters? Butters, whatever is troubling you, this isn\'t the answer. Look at all these people who\'ve come out for you! Just come down, son, and... we promise we won\'t ground you for more than a couple of weeks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|N\'aw geez! Now I\'m gonna get grounded, too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay, it\'s ready! Step down, Butters. \'\'[the pig is done, Butters steps down, and the pig is shoved into place]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Linda|He, h-he\'s coming down! Oh thank God!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 1|No, wait. What... what\'s he doing? \'\'[the Butters mask appears over the ledge]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Okay. One! Two! \'\'[Craig, Clyde, and Stan push the dressed pig]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 3|JESUS CHRIST! \'\'[Linda screams.

And so I\'d like you to help me welcome a new student who was just moved here from Dallas. Children please say hello to...

I\'m sure all the other girls will be happy to show you around the school. \'\'[the girls look cross]\'\' Won\'t you, girls?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red|Where do you buy your clothes?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Oh. Uhm, you know.

W-What are you talking about?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|An Old Farmer|\'\'[comes in]\'\' I know you\'re thinkin\' of puttin\'; him up there, the Indian Burial Ground up that road.

Burial Ground?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|An Old Farmer|It\'s been done before, what you\'re thinkin\' of.

What\'s lezzing out?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Now \'\'look\'\', Butters, when the girls bring out the future-telling device, pay attention to how it works.
