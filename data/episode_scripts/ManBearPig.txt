I\'m here to educate you about the single biggest threat to our planet. You see, there is something out there which threatens our very existence and may be the end of the human race as we know it. I\'m talking of course about... \'\'[a projector comes on and a picture of a monster appears]\'\' ManBearPig. \'\'[a beast with the legs and tail of a pig, the body and arms of a bear, and the face and upper-body posture of a man]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[softly, to Stan]\'\' ManBearPig? \'\'[Stan just turns his hands up and shrugs]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|It is a creature which roams the earth alone. It is half man, half bear, and half pig. Some people say that ManBearPig isn\'t real. Well, I\'m here to tell you know, ManBearPig is very real, and he most certainly exists. I\'m serial. ManBearPig doesn\'t care who you are or what you\'ve done. ManBearPig simply wants to get you! I\'m super-serial. \'\'[Mr. Mackey and Mrs. Garrison just look at each other.]\'\' But have no fear, because \'\'I\'\' am here to save you!

This is a total Kobe Bryant I\'m about to do. \'\'[keeps dribbling without making a move]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Just take a shot or pass the ball, asshole! It\'s getting late!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The beast moves closer to some bushes, then stands up and sees the basketball court.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Let\'s just see who gets the ball this time, Jewboy! \'\'[again tries to get by Kyle, but Kyle taps the ball away again.

You don\'t believe me either.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, no, it\'s not that.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Yes it is. Nobody believes me! \'\'[gets emotional]\'\' I\'m trying to warn everybody and nobody takes me serial! \'\'[begins weeping over the phone]\'\' I just want somebody in the world to take me serial just for once. \'\'[continues weeping over the phone, Stan rolls his eyes in pity.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ih it\'s okay, Mr. Gore, I, I believe you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|No you don\'t.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, I\'m sure ManBearPig needs to be stopped.

I\'m just scared that I can\'t do anything to stop him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Are you serial?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|...Yes, I\'m serial.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|\'\'[reinvigorated]\'\' Don\'t worry! We CAN stop him! Bring everyone you can to my ManBearPig meeting tomorrow at 8 a.m. sharp! \'\'[hangs up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|A Komfort Inn, morning.

Come on in! \'\'[the boys follow him in]\'\' Okay, let\'s get this meeting started. What do you kids think we should do to stop ManBearPig?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yyeah, you know, Mr. Gore, uh, my dad\'s a geologist, and he said that ManBearPig probably isn\'t in Colorado.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|\'\'[alerted, goes down on one knee]\'\' What does your dad look like?? Does he have large hooves where his feet should be??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|NO.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Damn. For a minute there, I thought we found him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, this was a great meeting. Wasn\'t it, guys? But, we gotta get goin\' to school now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|\'\'[an alarm goes off nearby]\'\' Oh my God! \'\'[runs to his control center and leans back in his chair to look closely at his monitor.

It\'s a it\'s a cave of some kind! \'\'[a map of Cave of the Winds is shown, with the target below the text blinking]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, that\'s Cave of the Winds. It\'s a tourist attraction.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Oh Jesus on ice skates, we\'ve gotta get down there right away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ah I don\'t think so, dude. \'\'[the boys head for the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, we\'ve got school anyway.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|I can get you all excused from school. \'\'[the boys stop in their tracks and turn around.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You... have that kind of power?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Look! You boys have a chance to help me find and kill ManBearPig once and for all! I\'m totally serial!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Wonderful Cave of the Winds, day, inside. A tour group gathers to embark on its tour.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Hello everyone, welcome to Cave of the Winds. Our tour is gonna take us to two chambers in one of the most elaborate cavern systems in Colorado. \'\'[his head bobs as he sighs]\'\' Before we get started I do understand we have a special guest in our group today: the ex vice president, Mr. Al Gore. \'\'[one or two people clap, and Gore smiles at the two ladies, one on either side of him]\'\' Mr. Gore asked me to make sure you all knew he was here. Now, once we enter the cave we do ask you that you follow two rules: stay on the path and do not touch anything. Aright, are we ready?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Group|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Let\'s go cavin\'. \'\'[turns on his headlight, opens the velvet rope and leads the group into the cave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The tour.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Here we are in the main chamber of the cave; it was discovered in 1892 and first used as a hideout for smugglers of the Old West.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Have you noticed high deposits of sulfur or a salmon-like odor coming from the caves lately?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|\'\'[to Al Gore]\'\' Ahh, no. \'\'[addressing the group]\'\' Now, as you can see, the cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites. Water drips from the cave\'s...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|All right, kids, I need you to keep an eye out for ManBearPig droppings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What do ManBearPig droppings look like?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Similar to pig droppings, but more manbearlike.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|These rocks often make interesting shapes which we like to name. For instance, this one here we named "The Hanging Mushroom." \'\'[a solid stalactite in the shape of a penis]\'\' And over here we have "Man With Helmet and Two Bowling Balls." \'\'[a massive stalagmite, again in the shape of a penis and two large testicles]\'\' And finally, of course, the "Two Sisters." \'\'[two smaller stalagmites, each the shape of a penis and testicles]\'\' Now the cave itself is millions of years old and has a constant temperature of 57 degrees.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Groan! Groan! \'\'[this stops the tour and everyone turns to face him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|Sir? Mr. Gore? Is there a problem?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|Not yet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|All right, everyone, if you\'ll step this way, you\'ll see how the cave gets its name. \'\'[the group moves forward]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|\'\'[looks at an opening and motions the kids over]\'\' Kids! Kids, over here! Look.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|I bet this is where he\'s hiding. \'\'[shines his light around]\'\' This looks like ManBearPig Central. Come on! \'\'[goes down the path he found]\'\' Come on! This is where ManBearPig is! I\'m serial! \'\'[the boys follow him down the path. They have officially broken from the group.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|In certain areas of the cave, the wind actually blows through, causing a sound you can hear. \'\'[the cave begins to howl]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Group|Wow...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman|Take a picture of the sound, Steven. \'\'[her husband takes the picture.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Al Gore\'s path.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Mr. Gore, I I think we should stay with the tour group.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|\'\'[hearing the wind]\'\' Wait! Shhh. \'\'[concludes]\'\' Christ! He\'s here! Take this rope! \'\'[hands some rope to Stan]\'\' Be ready to tie him up! \'\'[brings out a shotgun]\'\' I\'ve got you now, you son of a bitch! \'\'[begins shooting randomly, and bits of the cave ceiling begin falling]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What are you doing?! \'\'[bigger chunks of cave fall between Al Gore and the boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh no!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Al Gore|No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The boys|Aaaah! \'\'[the boys are now sealed off from Al Gore.

They\'re just children!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The tour. Chunks of cave begin falling along its path as well, and the tour guide takes appropriate action.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tour guide|O-kay, everyone, out of the cave. Now! \'\'[the group turns around and runs back towards the entrance. The collapse follows the group]\'\' Go! Go! Go out, now! \'\'[the last person out of the cave is Al Gore, and the cave entrance is sealed shut by the collapse of the cave ceiling]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The inner collapse.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hello?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Help!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We\'re trapped in here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Somebody get us some help down hyah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hello, help!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hello??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Hello!)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Help!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Forget it! They can\'t hear us!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(What are we gonna do??)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[pointing at Stan]\'\' You\'d better get us out of here, asshole!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[faces Cartman]\'\' Me??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You just had to go and be nice to Al Gore! Now we\'re trapped in a cave!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Maybe there\'s another way out of here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Oh, no kidding.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|A-all right, let\'s split up and look for a passageway. E-everyone take a different direction. \'\'[the boys split up.

If I\'m thin- I\'m gonna be so... pissed off! \'\'[loses his footing and slides down some distance to the floor. He gets up and coughs from all the dust that went up around him]\'\' Goddammit! \'\'[reaches down and grabs his flashlight. He slaps it until it comes back on, coughs, and looks ahead. His eyes grow big. Before him is "Smuggler\'s Den," a corner of the cave in which sits an open treasure chest and two skeletons guarding it. Gold and jewelry are in and around the chest, while the skeletons have guns in their hands. Cartman approaches slowly, in awe]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You see anything, Kenny??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(No, nothing!) \'\'[Cartman is frozen, speechless]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman?? Cartman, you see anything??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[in a soft, trembling voice]\'\' No, nothing \'\'[clears his throat and speaks normally]\'\' No, nothing here! Nothing this way! \'\'[his eyes fixed on the look, he swoons]\'\' Tr... treasure.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman, you okay?? \'\'[Cartman snaps out of it]\'\' You need help??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m fine! This way is just a... dead end! Coming back to you now! \'\'[turns to head back to the other boys, but turns around one last time to remember where the treasure is, then heads back to his friends.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It looks like we\'re completely sealed in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Yeah, No shit.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[returning]\'\' There\'s a small passageway about 200 yards over there, but... it goes for a long long way and it\'s pretty steep. \'\'[Cartman arrives]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Maybe we should go for it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys go on ahead. I\'m gonna... stay here, wait it out. \'\'[the other three boys turn to face him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Why?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I just... I I don\'t feel very good. I\'ll just wa-, I\'ll just weigh you guys down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Cartman\'s right. First rule of survival is stay put and wait to be rescued.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No, it\'s okay. You guys go on ahead.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No, we\'ll stay here too. If we start wandering off, we\'re gonna get lost or killed. Let\'s just wait here and hope help comes soon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s cool. I just... I just wouldn\'t go over there \'\'[points to his last location]\'\' if I were you guys. I just took a huge dump.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Aw, dude! \'\'[lifts his jacket over his nose.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cave of the Winds, outside. Rescue personnel have arrived and make their way towards the cave entrance. the tour guide demonstrates on a map what happened.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Miner 1|The cave-in was massive.

Gotta be strong. \'\'[looks at the coins in his hands]\'\' There\'s still a lot more treasure to go. \'\'[begins to swallow the coins and wash them down with "WOTTUR."
