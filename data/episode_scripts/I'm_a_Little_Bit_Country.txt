Just give me a second. \'\'[thinks]\'\' Oh okay, okay. How about this: Say guys, 1776 was so long ago. I wonder what life would have been like back then? \'\'[repeats the last two words, his voice fading at each repetition]\'\' Back then? Back then? Back then? \'\'[nothing happens. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look at him]\'\' Um... Oh waitwait, I know, I know! Heheh, you know guys, I don\'t even care about 1776. It was so long ago, that I don\'t think it has anything to do with me. \'\'[his voice begins to fade and he begins moving his hands around like a pantomime. The camera closes in]\'\' With me.

With me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That isn\'t gonna work, dumbass!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Slave|Kids, let\'s keep it down for study group, or else Mr. Garrison is going to punish me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[from behind his book]\'\' Just face it, Cartman. You\'re gonna have to study!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[throws a fit]\'\' Maaaaa. Meh mameh, Maaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Avenue. The opposing groups face each other in front of the tallest building in town. Skeeter paints a line across the span of the street and looks up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skeeter|There! All finished. From now on, this is the pro-war side of town, and that\'s the unpatriotic side. \'\'[the war supporters begin to clamor]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|How about we call this the rational side of town, and that the redneck side?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Protesters|Hahahaha, yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|You just keep all your flag burnin\' and your hippie-rock protest songs on YOUR side of the town!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Protester|Hey wait a minute, your side of town has the post office.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Well your side has the grocery store.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Well you can come to our side of town to use the post office and we can go to your side to use the grocery store.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Aaah, can we cross the line to take our kids to school?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|W-hell, naturally you could cross the line for that.

Don\'t you see? All this dividin\' up the town, it\'s just ridiculous.

Among the skirmishes: Kenny\'s mom attacks Gerald, Sheila attacks Ned]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s house, upstairs. The boys walk down the hallway and reach Cartman\'s room. He\'s rigged up a way to ... knock himself out. Three pulley wheels and a nail guide a string tied to the door across the entrance, up the wall, and back to the top of the door entrance. At the other end of the string is a big rock.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman, what the hell are you doing?! You\'re supposed to be studying! \'\'[the boys stop at the entrance to Cartman\'s room]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s what I\'m doing.

But I will have the last laugh. Gentlemen, if you will clear the doorway, please? \'\'[Stan and Kyle look at each other, Kenny looks at them. They clear the doorway.

The boys arrive at Cartman hanging from a candy-cane colored swing set with the swings removed. Beneath him is a tub of water.

Cartman is seen in period dress, face down on a dirt road. He comes to, looks up, sits up and looks around, then notices his clothes.

They attack each other with their signs. One man drives his "War is not my voice" sign straight down into another man\'s head. A man drives his "Bush is a Nazi" sign up a woman\'s nose after she swats him with her "Support Your Troops" sign. A woman strikes someone else down with her "No Blood for Oil" sign. Stan and Kyle just look on.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Philadelphia, day, Independence Hall. There\'s plenty of argument still going on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Congressmen|Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dickinson|We cannot found a country based on war!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Adams|We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Congressman|Rabble!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Congressmen|Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! \'\'[the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices become hushed]\'\' Oh my, it\'s Benjamin Franklin. It\'s Benjamin Franklin. It\'s Benjamin Franklin. \'\'[they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks towards the main desk]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, it\'s Benjamin Franklin. It\'s Benjamin Franklin. It\'s Benjamin Franklin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Hancock|Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Franklin|I believe that if we are to form a new country, we cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a country that appears to want both?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jefferson|Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going to war at the same time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dickinson|Right. If the people of our new country are allowed to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will protest it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Franklin|And that means that as a nation, we could go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn\'t want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the country will be forever blameless.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Adams|\'\'[holding a slice of chocolate cake]\'\' It\'s like having your cake, and eating it, too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Congressman 2|Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and doing another.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Hancock|And we will call that country the United States of America.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wow, I get it now! I get it! \'\'[senses his flashback coming to an end]\'\' Whoa, here it goes. I wish I could go back to my time. To my time, to, to my time.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Hell\'s Pass Hospital, day, Cartman\'s room. Cartman comes to and looks around.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wow!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, town square. The townsfolk are still attacking each other and killing more of their number. One man kills another with a "PEACE NOW" sign. A war supporter runs a flag pole through a protester, then pulls it back out again. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch from the other end of the square, towards the stage as the carnage continues.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[appears on stage in his hospital gown, his hair disheveled]\'\' Everyone, stop! Please! \'\'[everyone stops and looks at him]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman|The-the child! The child, from the hospital.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|If you all don\'t mind, I would like to do my report now. I know what the founding fathers would say.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|He does? \'\'[he and Kyle are shocked]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|He does?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I learned somethin\' today. This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same time, act like it doesn\'t want to. \'\'[a shot of the crowd]\'\' }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You people who are for the war, you need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it\'s made of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters, we\'d get taken down in a second. That\'s why the founding fathers decided we should have both. It\'s called "having your cake and eating it too."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|He\'s right. The strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skeeter|Yeah, but... if it weren\'t for all you guys protesting, why everyone around the world would hate the American people instead of just the President.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|And if it weren\'t for \'\'you\'\' people flexing your arms, America could easily get taken over by terrorists or... or China.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|I guess we... owe you an apology.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Eh-ah, I guess we owe \'\'you\'\' one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsfolk|Awww. \'\'[amid a chorus of awwws they hug each other.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Cartman? Cartman saved the day?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Can\'t be}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|The Founding Fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want, as long as we agree that America kicks ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skeeter|<i>Hey I\'m a little bit country</i>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|<i>And I\'m a little bit rock-n-roll-AH!</i>}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman takes his mic and backs out of the scene, leaving Randy and Skeeter to sing together.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skeeter|<i>I\'ll be the muscle of America</i>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|<i>And me, I\'ll be the caring soul.</i>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Together|<poem><i>And when you put us together you get a nation with one goal\nTo thrive and prosper, with a little country and rock and roll.</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Skeeter|Come on up here, everybody! \'\'[the crowd surges onto the stage.
