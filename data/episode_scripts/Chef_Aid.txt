That does not make sense.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Dammit..!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|He’s using the Chewbacca defense.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnnie Cochran|Why would a Wookiee, an 8-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor with a bunch of 2-foot-tall Ewoks? That does not make sense! But more important, you have to ask yourself: "What does this have to do with this case?" Nothing.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Gerald buries his head in his hands, defeated.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnnie Cochran|Ladies and gentlemen, it has nothing to do with this case! \'\'It\'\' does not make sense! Look at me, I\'m a lawyer defending a major record company, and I\'m talkin\' about Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and gentlemen, I am not making any sense! None of this makes sense! And so you have to remember, when you\'re in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation... does \'\'it\'\' make sense? No! Ladies and gentlemen of this supposed jury, it does not make sense! If Chewbacca lives on Endor, you must acquit! The defense rests.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Judge Moses|\'\'[After a long pause.]\'\' O-kay, then.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at Cartman\'s house where the boys are watching.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Wow, he’s good.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|In a teary-eyed courtroom, Johnnie Cochran has just finished his closing arguments, and, as anticipated, he did use the Chewbacca defense.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Courtroom sketches show an angry Chef staring at Gerald, Judge Moses holding his gavel, and Cochran in clown-like attire pointing left.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Whether or it worked... is up to the jury to decide.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back in the courtroom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Judge Moses|How find you the jury?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Foreman|We find the defendant, Jerome "Chef" McElroy... guilty as charged.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The spectators gasp again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Whoops.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Whoops?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Judge Moses|Mr. Chef, you have been found guilty of harassing a major company label.

Like you can just, walk out and then, come back like nothing happened? Oh, don\'t look at me like that, Mr. Hat.

Or something similar.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman and Kenny|Hooray!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Police Dept. Chef and Garrison now share the same cell.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|...And Mr. Twig is at home, he has no idea Mr. Hat is even back.

I know he seems guilty, but ladies and gentlemen, this...}}\n{{ScriptScene|He pulls down his display.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnnie Cochran|...is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does \'\'not\'\' make sense. Why am I talkin\' about Chewbacca when a man\'s life is on the line? Why? I tell you why. I don\'t know. It doesn\'t make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense, you must acquit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Johnnie Cochran now holds up a monkey.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Johnnie Cochran|Here, look at the monkey. Look at the silly monkey.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A juror chokes a bit, then his head explodes.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside. The courthouse entrance opens, and Chef emerges with Stan, Kyle, and Cartman behind him. Reporters gather around him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|Chef, how does it feel to be a free man and finally have your name credited on the song, "Stinky Britches"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|It feels great! I just can\'t find the words to thank all the artists who put on Chef Aid. And most of all, I want to thank the children.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter|So, what are you gonna do now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Get back to what\'s important. It\'s Tuesday.
