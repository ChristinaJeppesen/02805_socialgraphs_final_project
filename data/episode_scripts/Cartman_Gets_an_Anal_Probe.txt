Cartman\'s right foot is tied to a tree.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys, I have to get home.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t be such a fraidy-cat, Cartman. This rope will make sure they can\'t take you on board again.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman tugs his foot testing the rope.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh, man, this sucks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|How come the Visitors aren\'t coming for him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I think we have to signal them somehow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[Cartman farts fire.]\'\' Ow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Wendy|Hey, he\'s like Rudolph.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah!

Now listen! Why is it that everything today has involved things either going in or coming out of my ass?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Farts.

He\'s the little freckled kid that looks like a football. At first, I was happy you took him away. But I\'ve learned something today. That having a little brother... i- is a pretty special thing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Ah, heck, Mr. Visitors, I\'m just a kid all alone in this crazy world, but if you could find it in your hearts or whatever you have, to give my brother back to me, it sure would make my life brighter again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That was beautiful, dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Did it work?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, they\'re leaving.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey, you scrawny-eyed shits, what the fuck is wrong with you?!

For the love of God, Ike, jump!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|Don\'t hurt me.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A herd of cows runs away from the ship, but a trio of Visitors stops them in their tracks. The cows moo and quiver with fear until the middle Visitor raises its hand and addresses them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Visitor|Moo... Moo...Moo moo, moo moo... (Greetings, cows of Earth. We come in peace.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cows|Moo?? (Really??)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Come on, Ike!

Do your impersonation of David Caruso\'s career!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|It\'s my turn!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ike dives from the ship into the snow. The satellite goes back into Cartman\'s butt.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Visitor|Moo moo. Moo moo. (Farewell cows, peace be with you!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Visitors disappear. The spaceship pulls Cartman up but the rope keeps him grounded.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys, get me down from here!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He farts fire, burning the rope. The tractor beam takes him into the ship and the spaceship flies away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ow! Help! Sons o\' bitches!

I\'ve got you cornered. Let\'s see you get away now.}}\n{{ScriptScene|One of the cows steps on the plate on the Visitor\'s device. A beam from the device strikes Officer Barbrady.
