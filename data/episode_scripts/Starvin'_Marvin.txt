Here, have a Teiko sports watch.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He tosses Cartman a watch and hops into the van. The van drives off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|WEEEEEEAK!!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|In the woods near South Park. The screen is reduced to a wide screen format, so you know a movie reference is coming. The town is assembled for battle as the Mayor speaks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|People, we all have to do our part against the evil turkeys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsperson 1|There\'s too many of them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Come on! Where is that Thanksgiving spirit?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsperson 2|We can\'t stop them.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Chef rides up on a brown steed. His face is painted blue and white. He is wearing Scottish garb, wielding a sword and shield à la Braveheart.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef| Today, you fight for your city! You fight for your honor! These turkeys will continue to push until they have taken everything from us! These fudged up turkeys from the the crustaceous era can take our lives, but they can never take...our FREEDOM!!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Now pumped for battle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Crowd|Wooo, yeahhh, woo.}}\n{{ScriptScene|On a nearby hill the pack of turkeys is gathered together. One turkey is also painted in blue and white.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Leader turkey|Gobble, gobble. Gobble gobble. Gob, gobble. Gob, gob, gob, Gobble!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The other turkeys gobble like mad, then sally forth. The town residents stand ready for battle as the turkeys descend into the valley.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Here you go turkeys!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kyle moons the turkey forces.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The town force descends, the mayor and an aide stay behind.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Does my hair look okay?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ethiopian Desert. The vulture still circles...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Can\'t go on... need... appetizer... eh...}}\n{{ScriptScene|He looks up to the sky for relief.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m sorry, God, I\'m sorry I mocked poor people. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t more sensitive. Please, Please God, uhh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He falls forward to the ground. After a few seconds he lifts his head.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Heh, my god has forsaken me. Eh, err.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He sees something. A lone building stands in the distance. Cartman approaches. A sign reads, "No Admittance".}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Huh, I wonder what\'s in here?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman opens the door and faces towers of Cheesy Poofs, Snacky Cakes, Boogie Bars and Veal Roll-Ups. "Alleluyah" is playing. Cartman stands in awe, then is overjoyed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|SNACKY CAKES!! MMMM!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He rubs up against them lovingly. He sees a large-screen TV and a potted plant, and walks towards them. He then looks to his right and sees Sally Struthers feasting on some cake and two Ethiopians fanning her with palm fronds. She sees him and stops eating. Cartman is mad.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Sally Struthers?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally Struthers|Who the hell are you?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Gimme that cake!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally Struthers|Nooho, this is \'\'my\'\' cake!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No Sally Struthers, you \'\'gimme that cake!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally Struthers|NOO! You can\'t have any!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|No Sally Struthers, that\'s my cake eh-ehhhh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|After some more whining he opens the door and sees some Ethiopians passing by.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You guys, Sally Struthers is holding food from us!!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|They turn to look at him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally Struthers|Uh oh.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She just can\'t eat that cake fast enough.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Forest. The battle continues. The turkeys fight valiently, but many are falling. Ike beheads a turkey. Marvin looks on and scratches his head.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Stay close children.}}\n{{ScriptScene|His shield blocks one turkey as he slays another.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan, Kyle, Kenny|Yeaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The turkeys rush towards Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(O-Oh.)}}\n{{ScriptScene|One turkey manages to extract Kenny\'s eyeball as the others kill him outright. They speed away with pieces of him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my god, they\'ve killed Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You bastards!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|The last three are getting away, shoot \'em Ned.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ned picks off the remaining three birds.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We did it!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|As the town celebrates, some townsfolk are still beating on the birds, one of them with a large mallet.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|My God, what have we done?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|We\'ve saved Thanksgiving!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|But all those poor turkeys, theh- they\'re all dead.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Every turkey dies, not every turkey truly lives.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|As horrible as they were theh- they felt like a part of me. Perhaps I shouldn\'t be toying with God\'s creations, perhaps I should-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Yeah, yeah, yeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Two secret service agents approach Chef and Barbrady, ignoring the carnage.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 2|Excuse me sir, we\'re looking for a little starving Ethiopian boy who was accidentally delivered to South Park instead of a Teiko sports watch.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Showing a picture of Marvin.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 1|Have you seen anyone fitting this description.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer Barbrady|Oh, that could be a hundred kids in this town mister.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Marvin approaches the two agents.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent 1|There you are. Are you ready to go home now?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Marvin looks at Mr. Garrison, then at Chef, then at Officer Barbrady. He quickly shakes an affirmative. The agents lead him away, but he turns back to get some turkeys. Stan and Kyle look on as Kenny\'s corpse lies motionless behind them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow, it sucks he has to leave.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, I like him a \'\'lot\'\' more than Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You know, I think I\'ve learned something today. It\'s really easy not to think of images on TV as real people.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny\'s head moves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But they are. That\'s why it\'s easy to ignore those commercials, but, people on TV are just as real as you or I.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A rat moves in and out of Kenny\'s empty eye socket, then scurries away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And that means that McGyver is a real person too.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Ethiopian Desert. Three Red Cross workers are present.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Red Cross Chick|We\'re terribly sorry about the mix-up little boy. We\'ll get you back home immediately.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s right you will, God-Damnit.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A male agent checks his watch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Move it POVs, I\'m an American!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A plane lands. Marvin exits the plane.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ethiopian|A baba, gluck gluck bababab ga.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Marvin|Baba gook gook ba.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The cargo door lowers in back of the plane and a bunch of dead turkeys fall out. The Ethiopians grab the turkeys and raise Marvin on their shoulders in triumph. They march away, passing by a spit on which Sally Struthers has been tied, with an apple in her mouth.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sally Struthers|(What are you doing? Let me off of here!)}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny\'s House.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|Lord, on this day of thanks, we would like to extend our deepest gratitude for this incredible bounty of green beans you have bestowed upon us. And though for some reason you found it necessary to take our son from us, and though you for some reason find pleasure in watching us suffer, still, we give thanks. Amen.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|Amen.}}\n{{ScriptScene|She takes a brief look around.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Carol|Does anybody have a can opener?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|God Damn-it.}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia01|episode=9}}\n[[zh:非洲来客/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season One]]'}]}}}}
