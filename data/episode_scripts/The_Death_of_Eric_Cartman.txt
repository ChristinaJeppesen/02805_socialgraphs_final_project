All right, I\'ll help you!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Dawn at Cartman\'s Residence, the next day. Butters and Cartman approach Cartman\'s house.

Then there was the time I convinced a woman to have an abortion so I could build my own Shakey\'s Pizza. I pretended to be retarded and joined the Special Olympics.

He and Butters grin at the accomplishment. Behind them are some more baskets ready to go. The first basket goes to Principal Victoria. The second goes to Ms. Claridge. The third goes to the rabbi at the synagogue. The congregation there is surprised. The fourth goes to Scott Tenorman, who\'s sobbing at his parents\' graves. Butters and Cartman walk to their next destination with another basket as Stan, Kyle, and Kenny look on from across the street. They deliver that basket to the abortion clinic. He records the song below, with Butters and a recording engineer in the booth. Next, he and Butters are repairing Mr. Anderson\'s fence. Cartman hammers the new boards in place as Butters removes the damaged boards. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny appear and watch. Kyle angrily rejects what he\'s seeing and they walk away. Cartman and Butters then go to the Special Olympics stadium and present a basket to the coordinators. They leave a basket at Sally Struthers\' door.

Only it probably \'\'isn\'t\'\' a ghost, ih-it\'s just a delusion brought on by my trauma. Well I\'m supposed to heh, help him, find out why his spirit is wanderin\' the Earth, even though I know that I\'m most likely just completely insane.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Psychic|Well, many times, the reason that the soul stays Earth-bound is because God is intending to \'\'use\'\' that soul for a divine purpose, to help prevent an impending tragic event.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Of course. That\'s it, Butters! We had it wrong all the time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Psychic|But now, you shouldn\'t think you\'re crazy, young man. I see ghosts all the time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Psychic|Yes. When\'s the last time you saw yours?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, he\'s sittin\' next to me right now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Psychic|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! \'\'[runs out of the room screaming. The TV turns on mysteriously behind the boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hey, I think she could see you too. You really \'\'are\'\' a ghost.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I told you, Butters. \'\'[a breaking news item comes on]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|This is breaking news!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchor Tom|A tragic event is unfolding in South Park. Three convicted murderers have escaped from jail and are holding twelve people hostage at the Red Cross!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter Chris|Tom, the convicts were about to be arrested when they ran inside the Red Cross behind me, and threatened to kill all the workers inside. The violent men are demanding a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars cash.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my God, this is it, Butters. This is what I\'m here to stop. Come on, Butters. This psychic boy and his ghost pal are going to save the day!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Red Cross, later that night. A crowd has gathered and the police try to control the crowd}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer|Stay back, people!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Stay back?! Hell, my wife and child are in there!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Yates|Stay calm in there. We don\'t want anybody getting hurt.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lead convict|You get us a helicopter and two hundred thousand dollars or these people start dyin\', man!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Red Cross, outside. Butters and Cartman sneak past the police barricade}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right, Butters, I\'m going in alone, first. Give me thirty seconds in there, and then you go in and free the hostages.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Go in there? Uh, but they\'ll see me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Don\'t worry. I have a plan. \'\'[movers towards an entrance]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Eric. \'\'[Cartman turns around]\'\' Well, be careful, ghost pal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|They can\'t hurt me, Butters. I\'m already dead. \'\'[Cartman moves towards the front door. The detective notices]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Yates|What the hell is that kid doing?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Red Cross, inside. The convicts look out through the Venetian blinds}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bald convict|Somebody\'s comin\' in!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Convict 2|It\'s just some little fat kid. \'\'[the door opens and Cartman walks in. He starts making haunting, ghostly noises and rattling desks]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bald convict|What the hell is going on?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Convict 2|I have no idea.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes, it\'s working! \'\'[hops on a chair, picks up a book, waves it around, and flips the pages in the lead convict\'s face]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Lead convict|This is really weird. \'\'[Cartman walks over to a file cabinet, opens a drawer, and tosses out all sorts of papers. Butters enters the building, walking quietly as Cartman keeps the three convicts distracted]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Red Cross, outside.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter Chris|An incredible development here, Tom. Two little boys have fearlessly gone inside the Red Cross. \'\'[footage of Cartman entering the building is shown]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house. Stan, Kyle, and Kenny watch the news}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Cartman?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Red Cross, inside. Cartman swings two cowbells up and down. Butters has left the door open}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bald convict|\'\'[scratches his head]\'\' I\'m so confused! \'\'[Butters goes over to the office, removes the chair blocking the door, and opens the door.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Hurry. Go, go! \'\'[the hostages leave quickly, quietly. They exit the Red Cross.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Officer 2|The hostages are clear!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Yates|\'\'[through the bull horn]\'\' All right, move in! \'\'[the officers move in. Cartman is dancing around shaking the bells and making ghostly noises]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Convict 2|The hostages are gone!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bald convict|What?! \'\'[the officers pour in and arrest the convicts]\'\' Son of a bitch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Reporter Chris|Tom, an incredible story of courage. Two little boys, armed only with the weapon of confusion, managed to go in and save the Red Cross. Nobody seems to know who the boys are or where they went off to, but they are heroes.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The field across from the Red Cross. Cartman is about to take his leave for the third time}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, we did it, Butters. We saved the day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Boy, we sure did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|My spirit is at rest now. I can finally go to everlasting peace, eternal rest, and ten thousand dollars cash. Butters, I think that, through this whole thing, we\'ve really become friends.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Yeah. Uh I feel that way too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We both, kind of needed each other and... well... I\'m gonna miss you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I\'ll miss you too, ghost pal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[backs up again, waving his hands before him]\'\' Goodbye Butters. I must be going now. I\'ll be looking down on you from time to time. Have a long, fulfilling life, Butters!
