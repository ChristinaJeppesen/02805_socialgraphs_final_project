I know, it\'s wrong...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor|Nonono, what is the white stuff on the marijuana?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh that? That\'s cocaine.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor|WHAT???}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, I got the idea praying to Christ. You know, powder, snow, it\'s what gives Christmas Snow its kick. \'\'[gives Janson and the Mayor a tour of his small operation]\'\' Getting enough cocaine was the tricky part, so we started growing our own.
