Those hard-core liberals, lesbian activists, and die hard modern hippies young and old. \'\'[turns around and sighs]\'\' I swore I would never set foot in San Francisco. God help me. \'\'[reaches down, picks up the helmet, and puts it on, locks it in place, and pressurizes the suit. Communication resumes through the intercom]\'\' All right, Butters, I\'ll be tethered to you through this cord. It\'s my only lifeline, so make sure it stays taut. If you stop hearing my voice, for the love of Christ, start reeling me in with all your strength.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[adjusts his headset]\'\' I will. You\'re really great for going to warn Kyle, Eric.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'m not doin\' it for Kyle. \'\'[turns around]\'\' I can\'t believe I\'m actually going to walk through San Francisco. Well, here it goes. \'\'[begins to walk slowly and deliberately into the city]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Dawson\'s Junkyard, day. Hybrid cars are awaiting destruction. The camera focuses on a green one, which is soon lifted away by a massive electromagnet. Inside a small room, Stan mans the controls. Mr. Mackey and Stan\'s parents look on as Ranger McFriendly guides Stan}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ranger McFriendly|All right. All right, now get it into the masher! Hurry up!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Can\'t somebody else operate this? I can\'t really reach.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ranger McFriendly|Well then you shouldn\'t have written that gay little song, shouldn\'t you have?! \'\'[The green hybrid is now over the masher, and Stan releases it. Moments later, a cube of twisted green metal slides out and drops onto the ground]\'\' Keenan, we\'ve gotten rid of half the hybrid cars! How are the smug levels?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Keenan|They\'re dropping, slowly, but... but we\'re running out of time!}}\n{{ScriptScene|San Francisco. Cartman is now in the Haight-Ashbury district. People look and move on}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Yeah, it\'s like, San Francisco is more of a European city, like Paris or Milan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[checking in]\'\' Butters, are you there?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[making sure the cord is taut]\'\' I\'m here, Eric.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I\'ve started to enter the smug. I\'m about a quarter mile in. Can you give me an EL?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|\'\'[now reading a map]\'\' You must be nearing Union Square. Did you see a fountain to your left?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes. It\'s just beyond yet another wine and cheese store.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Wait, uhh, eh take your next right. You\'ve got to start heading west.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Turning right at O two four niner. \'\'[turns right at the corner and continues walking]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Dawson\'s Junkyard, day. Stan is still manning the controls. He drops a red hybrid into the masher, and a cube of twisted red metal slides out and drops onto the ground}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|That\'s it. That\'s that the last one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ranger McFriendly|Keenan? Keenan, we\'ve smashed the last hybrid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Keenan|Harry, the smug from Clooney\'s speech is about to hit the other smug system! Get everyone inside! \'\'[the townsfolk hear the warning and run around all over the place. Keenan says softly, deeply]\'\' God help us.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Over northeast Nevada, the speech\'s smug nears the supercell. From the ground, the smug is seen floating along quickly, reciting Clooney\'s speech. It runs into the super cell and stops talking. Immediately, lightning envelopes the super cell and spreads to San Francisco and South Park}}\n{{ScriptScene|San Francisco, under the Perfect Storm of Self-Satisfaction. Stuff begins to roll down the street on which Kyle lives. Cartman approaches his house}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Butters?! Butters, I think I\'m here! 2419 Castillo?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|That\'s it! Eric, hurry! Somethin\'s goin\' on out here!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Broflovski house. Gerald and Sheila are thoroughly spent from the party, so they don\'t take notice of the storm outside. Cartman opens the door and the sound of thunder fills the house}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Mr. Broflovski! Mr. Broflovski, there a smug storm! We have to go!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|\'\'[Slowly, blissfully]\'\' Being smug is a good thing. \'\'[farts in his armchair, bends down to inhale it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh my CHRIST! \'\'[runs up to Kyle\'s room and kicks the door open. Kyle and Ike are as wasted as Gerald and Sheila are. They sit on the floor with their backs against Ike\'s bed]\'\' Kyle? Kyle!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|The acid. Dude, I\'m totally tripping balls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ike|I\'m totally tripping balls. I\'m totally tripping balls.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[trying to shake Kyle to his senses]\'\' We have to get out of here! Now! \'\'[lightning strikes the house, which begins to burn. The lights begin to flicker, and the camera zooms in on Cartman, who continues shaking Kyle]\'\' Kyle! Kyle!! \'\'[the screen goes black]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Fade in to South Park, the morning after. People begin cleaning up. The storm dealt a heavy blow to South Park}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Network anchor|And now, the worst appears to be over. Last night\'s smug storm... has left thousands homeless. All across the Midwest, people are picking up the pieces. Cities like Denver and South Park are heavily damaged, but still all right. However, San Francisco, I\'m afraid... has disappeared completely up its own asshole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I\'m sorry, Stan. I\'m sorry your gay little song killed your friend.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|Hey! Hey, Stan! You\'re not gonna believe it! You\'ve gotta come see!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|It\'s a miracle!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Downtown South Park, day. The Broflovskis are back in town, safe and sound and glad to see everyone. Everyone marvels at their return. The Marshes arrive. Stan spots Kyle and runs up to him}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Kyle!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, what happened?? \'\'[grins]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|We don\'t know. We were all passed out and... next thing we know we just woke up on a bus heading here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|It\'s like you had a guardian angel, m\'kay? \'\'[Butters looks to Cartman for any reaction. Cartman puts his left index finger to his mouth, indicating that Butters should keep his mouth shut about this]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[gives Kyle a brief hug]\'\' Dude, I\'m so glad you\'re not dead.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Richard|So I guess there\'s nothing left to do now but... rebuild.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah. First off, we\'re all gonna need new cars.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|And let\'s make sure nobody gets a stupid hybrid, right? \'\'[everyone seems to agree and discusses it...]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|NO! Hybrid cars are a \'\'good\'\' thing!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|But hybrid cars are the leading cause of smug, m\'kay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hybrid cars don\'t cause smugness, people do. \'\'[silent reactions all around]\'\' Look, hybrid cars are important. They may even save our planet one day. What you all need to do is just learn to drive hybrids and not be smug about it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|You mean... drive in hybrids... but not act like we\'re better than everyone else because of it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I\'m... \'\'[puts his hands over his lower belly]\'\' I\'m not ready...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|I don\'t think I can do it either.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|It\'s simply asking too much.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Perhaps... one day... we can learn to drive hybrids without being smug about it, but for now... the technology is just too much for us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Gerald|Come on, everybody! Let\'s go buy wasteful gas guzzlers! \'\'[everyone likes the idea; they all disperse]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[walks up to Kyle]\'\' Well, looks like you\'re back for good, huh Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, I guess so.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We just can\'t get rid of you, can we, you sneaky Jew rat!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Don\'t belittle my people, you fucking fatass! \'\'[turns and walks away angry]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Ah, that\'s better. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n}}\n\n{{Episodemedia10|episode=02}}\n[[zh:自负警告！/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Ten]]'}]}}}}
