But we just thought that maybe someone else had found Tommy, and then lost him again. We\'re pretty certain that it\'s our boy, considering his physical appearance.

Uh, I\'ll contact the young boy who gave me the photo, and perhaps we can all visit him together.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Martha|Oh, wonderful!

I knew it was funny, but I couldn\'t laugh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|Well Eric, I suppose that, just like everything else, laughter can be relative - in, in other words, sometimes people see somethin\' so scary that nothin\' else scares them, so, the same could be true for funny things.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[turns over to look at Mr. Mackey]\'\' So does that mean I\'ll never laugh again?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Mackey|It\'s possible, hm\'kay? \'\'[Cartman turns over and lays on his back again]\'\' But you know, if you have completely lost your sense of humor, you can always become a writer for the show, "Friends" \'\'[laughs at the unexpected humor in his own statement]\'\'.
