Two kids play tic-tac-toe, and two others play tetherball. Cartman looks again and sees a sign saying, "Gruffy Bear sez: Try to escape and we\'ll shoot you where you stand." Two soldiers pace the catwalk above. Cartman looks again, and three boys beat a fourth over a football. A kid in nothing but briefs puts on airs while smoking.

Kyle holds his shoulder, but moves with him.

Son of a bitch, dammit! \'\'[remembers where he is]\'\' Oh, sorry.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve Black|No, I\'d, actually agree with you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve Black|Yeah. I have a real problem.with hate-crime legislation. In fact, I\'d love to see you kids go down and give the governor a piece of my mind.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Well, why don\'t you tell the governor yourself?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve Black|Oh, he wouldn\'t listen to me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Why not?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve Black|Because I\'m black.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan, Kyle|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve Black|Sit down, boys.

Hoh. \'\'[walks in with a box and tosses it on the ground]\'\' Here you go, God-damnit!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|\'\'[tosses his book away and stands up]\'\' Cool! My very own Tic-Tac-Throw game. \'\'[picks it up]\'\' Ew, it smells, man.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, what the hell do you expect, huh?! Now I got your stupid game; tell me how to break out of here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|You\'re \'\'not\'\' gonna break out of here! You\'re here \'til you\'re 21, douche!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|But you said-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|I just wanted you to sneak stuff in for me. What? You actually think I give a crap about you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I thought that-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|Hneah. You\'d better wise up to the way things work in the big house. \'\'[walks to the cell door]\'\' Hey guys! I gots me a new Tic-Tac-Throw \'\'[Cartman, forsaken, begins to cry]\'\' Yeah, it\'s a little ripe, but it\'s brand new, man! You can play it at recess. \'\'[turns to Cartman]\'\' Hey. Uh, what are you doing? \'\'[Cartman cries some more]\'\' You... you can\'t cry in prison, man. They\'ll bust your head open.

An aide peeks in}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide|Governor, the Free Eric Cartman Now Committee is here to see you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Governor|Naw, not another committee. Send them in. \'\'[Stan, Kyle, and Tolkien enter. Kyle carries a boombox and Tolkien an easel with their presentation on it.

Kyle presses the play button for some ambiance]\'\' Yes, over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[flips a page to depict a stabbing in progress]\'\' If somebody kills somebody, it\'s a crime. But if someone kills somebody of a different color, it\'s a hate crime.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And we think that that is \'\'[flips the page to reveal a copy of the title page]\'\' a savage hypocrisy, because all crimes are hate crimes. If a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife, is that not a hate crime?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[flips the page to reveal a person tagging City Hall]\'\' If a person vandalizes a government building, is it not because of his hate for the government?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[flips the page to reveal a man being hit deliberately by a car]\'\' And motivation for a crime shouldn\'t affect the sentencing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[flips the page to reveal warring groups of people around a question mark]\'\' Mayor, it is time to stop splitting people into groups. All hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites, that homosexuals need to be treated differently from non-homos, that we aren\'t the same.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[shows a rainbow of people holding hands]\'\' But instead, we should all be treated the same, with the \'\'same\'\' laws and the \'\'same\'\' punishments for the same crimes \'\'[Stan flips the page to reveal their hate crime proposal]\'\'. For in that way Cartman can be freed from prison, and we \'\'[flips the page to show them winning a sledding race]\'\' will have a chance to win the sledding race on Thursday.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That is our presentation. An idea that we call...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|\'\'[flips the page to reveal another copy of the title page]\'\' "Hate Crime Laws: A Savage Hypocrisy." \'\'[Kyle turns the tape player off]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Governor|Hm. That made the most sense of any presentation I\'ve heard in the last three years.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outside Alamosa Juvenile Hall, Friday night.

They\'re sending the dogs after us! \'\'[Cartman runs ahead, Romper trips on a rock]\'\' Mph. Oowww!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[turns around]\'\' What\'s the matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|\'\'[looks up]\'\' It\'s my leg! I think it\'s broken. \'\'[looks back]\'\' You go on ahead without me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Uhokay. \'\'[turns and runs]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|Hey. \'\'[Cartman stops and turns]\'\' You\'re supposed to say, "I\'m not going without you," or something.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh. Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|Look, kid, you go on. You\'ve got something to live out there. You\'ve got friends.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah. I never really realized that until just now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Romper Stomper|I sure would have liked to have seen Disneyland. Here.
