The plant-based Tegridy Burger is changing the way people think about food. \'\'[Main Street. Twelve townspeople are eating Tegridy Burger and appear lethargic, with one man laying on the ground. A car moves slowly across the street, the occupant stopping then eating again twice.]\'\' All over the state, people are turning vegan and eating more ethical sustainable meat.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bll Keegan| \'\'[standing next to Randy in front of the crowded Tegridy Burger store, dozens of customers present.]\'\' I\'m standing now with Randy Marsh, the owner of Tegridy Burger, and, Mr. Marsh, you must be pretty excited. \'\'[customers cheer and applaud Randy as he looks back at them.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, you know, we\'re all just -- We\'re all just bein\' healthy and ethical over here!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bll Keegan|Uh-huh, and, Mr. Marsh, what about \'\'[abruptly shifts tone, staring into camera and moving in front of Randy.]\'\' the student protests coming out against your burger right now?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[caught by surprise.]\'\' Huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bll Keegan|Students are coming forward, saying that Tegridy Farms is unethical and hypocritical.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Rick|\'\'[joins the reporter, wearing a blond ewig and a blue college Cows jacket.]\'\' That\'s right! Tegridy Burger is a fraud! We caught their farm on camera. Just take a look!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bll Keegan|We warn you, the following footage is graphic. \'\'[footage plays of Randy and Towelie killing cattle the other night; Randy kicking a cow that is already dead as it groans; and Randy pulling down his pants and exposing himself next to a cow.]\'\' }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Huhuhuh! \'\'[shooting a final cow in the footage as mooing can be heard]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bll Keegan|Mr. Marsh, what do you have to say about these images? \'\'[customers are already booing and beginning to throw burgers at him.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh, hey.

Now just be calm.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What are you sorry about? It\'s me who owes all you guys an apology. \'\'[The students all look deeply confused.]\'\' I thought you guys were all trying to force me to eat healthy, but I\'ve learned that a lot of this stuff is made in a factory and processed with tons of salt just like all my favorite foods! SpaghettiOs, Rice-A-Roni... Here I was thinking what you wanted was stuff from a farmers market. I just didn\'t want my food to change. School cafeteria meat is just processed crap that comes in a box, and this is... just processed crap that comes in a box. \'\'[Wendy, Bebe and Monica Ryland seem dismayed as they look at their food now.]\'\' I don\'t have a problem with it. All I wanted was to be able to eat the same garbage I always have, and this is definitely garbage. And hey, if it happens to be more ethical and sustainable, well, I guess I\'m fine with that, too. So, you see, guys? There was actually no reason to protest! We were actually all on the same page all the time! At least we learned that freedom of speech truly doesn\'t matter!
