I\'m gonna start following the rules.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But, this isn\'t you, Cartman.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, where is the Eric Cartman we know? The Eric Cartman we know breaks the rules.

I think we did it. \'\'[raises his left arm, and Stan high-fives it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, hallway. PC Principal walks through it like the Big Man On Campus. The kids look up at him in awe. He reaches the stairs leading up to the faculty bathroom. Nearby Jenny Simons looks at him, he looks back. He opens his arms as if to scare a bear, then he takes a step in Jenny\'s direction. Jenny backs away immediately. PC Principal goes downstairs.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Faculty bathroom, moments later. PC Principal puts his glasses behind his head and does his business at the urinal.

See you around. \'\'[stops and looks down]\'\' Oh, you seem to have dropped something, PC Principal. \'\'[picks it up]\'\' What\'s this? Why, this is a little boy\'s underwear. \'\'[sniffs at it]\'\' Why, this is Butters\' underwear.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|\'\'[zips up and looks at Cartman]\'\' What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|PC Principal, you have Butters\' underwear and now... \'\'[drops it into the urinal and soaks it in PC Principal\'s urine - the principal had not flushed the urinal - and pulls the briefs out.]\'\' Oh my gosh, it\'s got your DNA all over it. \'\'[through some windows above the urinal, Kyle, Butters, Craig, Stan, and Tolkien watch the action unfold]\'\' This certainly doesn\'t look good for you. I don\'t need to tell anyone about this. No, I think we have an understanding.

The other boys leave the window and walk away.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Rho Omega Delta house. The frat bros are having a good time as "Genius of Love" plays in the background. Randy looks out from his bedroom window, not being able to sleep, and sees the frat house. He puts his fists against his hips and heads for the house.

Well, I\'ll tell you what it means.

Yeah! Dude, let\'s go! Woowooo!

The PC bros have gathered around a door entrance, and begin chanting...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC bros|<poem><i>Social Justice 1 2 3 Woowoo!\nI wanna be PC Woowoo!\nIt\'s just the way to be for me!\nAnd you!\nWoowoo!\nYour hateful slurs are through!

Yeah! Yeah! Fuck yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC bro 5|Fuck yeah, bro! PC bro! \'\'[Cartman is now on the scene, walking with a crutch and a walkie-talkie.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right, send in the pregnant Mexican women! \'\'[Butters, with a semaphore flag in each hand, gives the signal for the women to rush the house]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pregnant Mexican Women|Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC bro 5|Fuck, bro?! \'\'[Cartman stops by the taco launchers, which are manned by Clyde, Craig, and Tweek]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Fire the taco launchers! \'\'[the boys load the launchers and let fly. Tacos rain down upon the frat house. The women arrive and run into the house, picking up tacos on the way]\'\' Syrian refugee children, flank from the left! \'\'[a truck load of Syrian refugee children is waiting for the truck bed to empty out. Butters releases the cargo door and the kids flood out towards the house]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC bro 2|Dude, what is this, bro?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC bro 6|I don\'t know, bro!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[looking through some binoculars]\'\' The Syrian refugee children are in; send in Jared! \'\'[Jared appears with his arms stretched out, ready to grab anything. He follows the women and the kids into the frat house, but doesn\'t grab anyone. The rest of the neighborhood gathers and marches towards the house]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stephen|What in the world is going on??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right, good. The pregnant Mexican women are falling asleep on the tacos. \'\'[sees Jared on the balcony trying to grab some kids, and some bros stop Jared]\'\' Jared needs backup, send in the Chinese drivers. \'\'[a split second later two cars crash into each other in front of the house.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|A PC Bro|\'\'[falls from the balcony to his death]\'\' Ohhh! \'\'[lands on his head]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|All right, the Syrian refugees are trying to protect their children! Gimme a- Oh fuck, there\'s Kyle. \'\'[lowers his binoculars]\'\' What the fuck are you doing, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Enough! Stop! Everyone STOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHP! \'\'[The camera shows his head bigger than usual and the air brighter then usual. His voice echoes across town and everyone stops in their tracks. A pregnant woman picks up a taco and runs off with it.]\'\' This is so wrong! I can\'t let it continue! This is not ever what I intended! I just want to say... Caitlyn Jenner is a hero. There\'s no other way to say it. What she did took bravery, and she is absolutely stunning. \'\'[Moments later, PC Principal steps forward and begins clapping. Once the clapping reaches normal speed, others begin to join in. A live-action shot of Brett Farve at the ESPYs "limp-clapping" is even thrown in]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman|Wooo.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, the dawn of a new day. Everyone gathers in the school cafeteria, which has a sign at the entrance: WELCOME TO 2015 SOUTH PARK. Inside, people are having conversations, kids are running around, Randy\'s butt is getting branded...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ow, hot. Hot hot, hothohhht. \'\'[PC Bro 4 takes the branding iron off, and Randy is officially a PC Bro. He stands up and gets dressed.]\'\' Ahhh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|I gotta hand it to you, Marsh. You really checked that little boy\'s privilege. Using those Syrian refugees was genius, bro.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC bro 4|Yeah. I would have never thought to use offensive imagery and outrageous stereotypes to provoke someone to open their eyes.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|So I\'m PC now?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|PC Principal|You\'re not only PC, you\'ve actually changed my PC. \'\'[whips out some sunglasses]\'\' Congrats. Here\'s your Oakleys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh wow. Oakleys! \'\'[puts them on and his voice changes]\'\' Oh yeah bro, these are sweet. \'\'[The big five stand nearby observing the small ceremony]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So I guess PC Principal is here to stay, huh?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes. But at least we showed him that sometimes joking about un-PC things can actually be important, because it starts a dialogue. \'\'[Kyle lowers his eyelids and the others back away]\'\' What\'s wrong, Kyle? You have your cake. Eat it, too.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It just seems to me like we all lost in this, and that the only person who won was you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hmmm... And who does that remind you of, Kyle? Now if you don\'t mind, I\'m gonna go home and fuck my hot wife. Who, kind of looks like, a dude. \'\'[Cartman hums his own version of the end theme song over the credits.]\'\'}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia19|episode=01}}\n[[ja:Stunning and Brave/台本]]\n[[zh:英勇的变性人/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season Nineteen]]\n[[Category:Scripts]]'}]}}}}
