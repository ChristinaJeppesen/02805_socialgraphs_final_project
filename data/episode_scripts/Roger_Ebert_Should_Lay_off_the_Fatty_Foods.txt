My name is Dr. Adams. Welcome to the plane\'arium.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I thought it was planetarium.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Adams|Well, it is.

If I project a drawing of a big dipper on top of it...\'\'[Very softly.]\'\' a-hah \'\'[The drawing appears, connecting the stars.]\'\' ...we see where this constellation gets its name. These stars over here form the constellation of Taurus, the Bull...}}\n{{ScriptScene|The drawing of a bull appears.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Adams|...while these stars form the constellation, "Roger Ebert".}}\n{{ScriptScene|An outline of Roger Ebert\'s face appears with a thumbs down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dr. Adams|And these two little stars over here form the constellation The Crusades.}}\n{{ScriptScene|From the two stars comes an elaborate drawing of crusaders storming the city of Jerusalem.

The school bell rings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Okay, children, today we\'re going to learn all about Japanese poems called haiku.
