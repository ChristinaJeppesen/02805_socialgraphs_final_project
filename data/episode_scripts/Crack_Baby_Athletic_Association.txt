If the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop, why does my salary matter?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Clyde|\'\'[arriving with Craig]\'\' You guys! You guuys! We\'ve got some bad news. Slash isn\'t real. \'\'[he has a book under his arm]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Slash isn\'t real.

The five boys stand inside Mr. Peters\' office.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Peters|\'\'[speaking with the same Southern accent Cartman used earlier]\'\' Boys, I want to thank you for bringin\' the CB double A franchise here to EA Sports. You\'ve made us a lohhht of monih.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wait a minute. According to this you now own all the rights to Crack Baby Basketball and we got nothing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Peters|\'\'[serves himself a drink]\'\' Yes, our lawyers are damn good. But you didn\'t get nothin\'. Why, you boys got experience, didn\'tcha? You got a chance to play in the big leagues. Sure, we here at EA might have made all the monih, but you little workers had a chance to make some\'in\' of yourselves. I\'d give you some free video games, but it\'s against the rules. \'\'[smokes a cigar]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You can\'t do this! We were gonna build an orphanage!

Somewhere around the medical center, Stan and Kyle walk along}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s unbelievable, Stan. EA Sports just used us the entire time. We worked for nothing and EA made all the money. You know, I don\'t think we actually deserved getting screwed over but, but I guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems. I know, I know, right? We might\'ve got screwed, but the really tragic thing is that those, those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there, with nowhere to go. \'\'[something grabs his attention]\'\' No way! \'\'[a brand new building is shown: "South Park Orphanage for Crack Babies"]\'\' This is it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It\'s what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|This is it, Stan! \'\'[runs across the street and enters the orphanage.
