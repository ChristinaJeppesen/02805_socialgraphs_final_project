A banner reading "WE HAVE GAMESPHERE" hangs over the window, and the console itself is in the window display.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|There it is. The Okama GameSphere. \'\'[the game console is shown, along with two controllers and several boxes containing the console]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, it\'s got a hundred twenty eight gigahertz D-RAM.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What\'s that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Don\'t know, but it kicks ass. \'\'[they watch as Sharon buys the console from Mr. Harris and he wraps it up and delivers it to her]\'\' Wow, dude, you\'re the luckiest kid in South Park.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey, this is \'\'all\'\' of ours.

Around them are empty boxes of Cheesy Poofs and cans of Zoop soda. On the sofa is a bag of chips. Stan\'s parents walk up to the boys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Goodnight, boys. Don\'t stay up too late.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|G\'night Mom, thanks for GameSphere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[slowly slides into a hick accent]\'\' Yeah, but you still shouldn\'ta done that. \'E\'s just a boih.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Nothing. Come on, Randy. \'\'[whisks him off to bed. From the TV: "Twenty kills."]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, Sunday morning, dawn. The boys have stayed up all night playing video games.

That\'s why Towelie says, "Always keep an extra towel in your duffel bag."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Okay, we will.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'[raises its arms in victory]\'\' Alright! \'\'[lowers them, then after some moments]\'\' Do you wanna get high?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No we don\'t wanna get high!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Okay... You sure?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yes! Go away, you stupid towel! \'\'[Towelie goes away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, dude! Did you see that? I cut off your face and ate it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s... so... cool!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, later... The boys have repositioned themselves and look half-asleep from all the game play. Doughnuts and ice cream appear - a cone is on the rug with its ice cream melting. Sharon walks up to them again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Okay, boys, that\'s it. You have to go now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No no, it\'s okay, Mom. We c-we can\'t go to baseball practice \'cause Kyle has cancer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|No, Stanley, it\'s Monday morning.

You mean Towelie? \'\'[the two soldier look alarmed. The passenger quickly gets on the radio]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Echo, this is Garrett.

Code 5, Park County, Colorado! \'\'[the men look at the boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What, dude? \'\'[the driver steps on the gas and the car peels away. The passenger soldier looks out the window and back at the boys.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This is gonna be one looong-ass day. \'\'[Ms. Crabtree pulls up and the boys get on the bus.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, Monday afternoon. The boys arrive there from the bus stop}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|That was the longest day of school ever!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Come on, hurry. I bet we can get to level 29! \'\'[the boys burst in and head for the television]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, living room.

Who-who is this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Voice|Just get the towel and meet us at the gas station outside of town. Or else! \'\'[in the background: "Okama GameSphere!"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Don\'t hurt it! \'\'[Click. Stan then hangs up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What? \'\'[Stan turns around]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|They\'ve taken it. They\'ve taken our Okama GameSphere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[in disbelief, backs up.]\'\' No! ...No!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Uh-uh-uh what do you mean "they\'ve taken it"? Oh, this isn\'t happening! This isn\'t happening!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park, sunset.

Where could it be?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t know. They guy on the phone thought we had Towelie, so now we gotta find him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What has this world come to? Where people can just... take your Okama GameSphere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey maybe we\'d better do a towel call. \'\'[the others stop, and he calls out in one direction]\'\' Gebaayybeh! \'\'[then in another]\'\' Gebaayybeh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s a towel call?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|This is hopeless. We\'re never gonna find him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey, wait a minute. Towelie always showed up to give us towel advice when we\'d said something about water.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey yeah. \'\'[goes into the street and clears his throat]\'\' Well guys, let\'s go to the swimming pool! \'\'[looks around. So do the others]\'\' Aaah. Let\'s go take a shower! \'\'[all look around]\'\' Let\'s go waterskiing!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'[walks up]\'\' Don\'t forget to bring a towel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|There he is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Be sure to bring a towel so you don\'t get aaall wet. \'\'[Stan walks over angrily and takes Towelie\'s left hand, and pulls him along]\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, dude! \'\'[the others follow]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Where are we goin\'?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Just come on! It\'s getting dark.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Are we gonna get high?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Outskirts of South Park, night. A full moon shines down on the boys as they reach the gas station}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Are you sure this is where they said to be?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|They said the gas station outside of town.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Well, I\'m gonna get a little high. \'\'[A high-powered light comes on]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Hold it! \'\'[ten men stand in the light. Some of them wear red berets]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Who is that? \'\'[squints his eyes and blocks the light. Towelie does the same]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Man|Step... away... from the towel! \'\'[the boys do so, and an official steps forth]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Official|There you are, towel.

Oh yeah, back at the base. It\'s a long ways away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright, we\'re gonna have to use this truck. Come on, guys. \'\'[they go for the truck. From a distance in a woods nearby, a commander looks at the troop movements]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Well?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier|They\'ve gone, sir. It\'s like they\'ve vanished out of thin air.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Damnit! I knew those boys were protecting that towel. \'\'[gets pensive]\'\' They must have some unexplainable bond with it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier 2|Perhaps they\'re telepathically linked to the towel, sir, like E.T. \'\'[the commander looks at him annoyed, and he leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|It could already be anywhere, hiding out again. No, the time for being nice is over. We must instigate...

You\'d better remember where your base is!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Oh man, why is everyone riding me today? God-damnit.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A purple house, night. Inside, in the restroom, a woman washes her hands and face, then pulls a towel out of its rack to dry herself}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman|Kevin?

You see, this is not an ordinary towel. He is the RG-400 Smart Towel, designed with a computer chip inside the terry cloth}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|You see, here at Tynacorp, our goal was to make the perfect towel. A towel that would sense how wet or dry the user\'s skin was and fluff itself accordingly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, we don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Towelie was our greatest success. Smart enough to beat the average human at chess and absorbent enough to soak up even the toughest spills. But then one day, Towelie got high and just sort of wandered off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We... don\'t... care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|All we wanna know is, who has our Okama GameSphere?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Ah yes, your video game. I\'m afraid that what we all experienced was a trap. They called you and said to bring the towel, and then they called us and said they were bringing Towelie back. Their plan was to wipe us all out with one fell swoop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Who\'s they?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Why, the military. You see, after Towelie got high and wandered off from here, the military got a hold of him. They wanted to turn Towelie into a weapon of mass destruction.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[dismissive]\'\' Don\'t care, don\'t care, don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Towelie was at their base for months as they tried to copy his TNA.

Can we \'\'please\'\'... just get back to playing our video game, PLEASE?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|I\'m afraid not. Because your Okama GameSphere is at "their" base.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Can you tell us where "that" is, please?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|You mean to go right into their base? \'\'[thinks]\'\' Of course. The entry code should still be in Towelie\'s memory banks. You \'\'could\'\' sneak him in there and recover his TNA. Great plan.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Secret Government Base, night.

The boys land silently and start walking}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Alright, I think we go over there. \'\'[the Secret Government Base entrance is shown with Towelie and the boys approaching the gate]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'[at the security entry pad]\'\' Let\'s see. \'\'[types in some numbers]\'\' No. \'\'[touches his lips with his right index finger, trying to figure out what to type next]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, Towelie! The guy said you have the security system in your memory banks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Hey it\'s been a long time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You just have no long-term memory \'cause you get high all the time!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'[faces Cartman]\'\' Don\'t preach to me, fatso!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I can preach to you all I want, \'cause you\'re stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'You\'re\'\' stupid!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, and you\'re a towel!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'You\'re\'\' a towel! \'\'[Cartman has nothing more to say, and Towelie hops off the box towards the boys]\'\' Just let me get high. I know I can remember if I get high.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, God damnit! Alright, fine! \'\'[gives Towelie the joint]\'\' Here\'s your stupid lighter. \'\'[tosses Towelie the lighter, and Towelie lights up. The bloodshot eyes return.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Hold on. \'\'[hops on the box and types into the entry pad again.]\'\' Wait a second \'\'[presses a few buttons]\'\' That\'s it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Yeah. That\'s the melody to "Funky Town." \'\'[starts playing the melody on the keypad] Won\'t ya take me down... to Funky Town.\'\' }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|No, Towelie, the entry code!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'[turns around]\'\' For what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|God-damnit, I guess we\'re gonna have to climb the stupid fence.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Secret Government Base, night, inside. The boys climb over the fence and sneak past a soldier without arousing suspicion. They end up at the genetic research building}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well let\'s look in here. \'\'[opens the door and leads the others in. Before them are cylinders of liquids, each with a floating deformed clone of Towelie in it. They come across a Towelie clone drying under a heat lamp]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie Clone|Kill... me... Kill... me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Oh my God! No-o-o-o!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|\'\'[enters with four soldiers, who quickly get set to fire]\'\' Well well well. Look what the cat dragged in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|\'\'[turns around with the boys]\'\' What are these things?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Genetic copies we tried to make with your TNA. They didn\'t work too well, I\'m afraid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie Clone|Kill... me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Do you have our Okama GameSphere?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|You did very well to get the towel this far, boys. I wonder: What did they tell you at Tynacorp? That the big, bad government wanted to genetically engineer a Towelie as a weapon? Now let me tell you the real story.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh God, don\'t care, don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|\'\'[pacing proudly, solemnly]\'\' Yes, we\'ve been trying to make our own genetic copies of the towel, but only because we had to. You see, when we started spying on Tynacorp, we discovered a certain, terrifying secret. \'\'[the boys show no interest.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier|Go on! Ask him what terrifying secret.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|What terrifying secret?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|That Tynacorp was making these towels to take over the world!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|We\'re never gonna play our Okama GameSphere again, are we?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Don\'t you see what genetically enhanced smart towels like these are capable of? You get out of the shower and dry yourself off. But even after you\'re dry, the towel makes you \'\'more\'\' dry. It keeps getting you drier and drier. \'\'[his voice begins to deepen]\'\' Can you imagine it? What it would feel like to be way, way too dry? I\'ll tell you something: You don\'t want to know. And I \'\'don\'t\'\' know.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And we don\'t care.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|You\'ve been double-crossed by Tynacorp, kids. They set this all up to get you in here and take us down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So let me get this straight: Our Okama GameSphere is back at Tynacorp.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Oh yes. It has been all along.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Soldier|Can I kill the towel now, sir?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Go ahead. \'\'[the boys move away quickly]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|No, wait. \'\'[stays the weapon]\'\' Perhaps now, we can use their own towel against them. These boys must return to Tynacorp, and we will launch a sneak attack on Tynacorp as well. \'\'[zoom in on a tiny camera close to Towelie\'s lower border. Officials back at Tynacorp\'s command center are looking at the live feed]\'\' You boys can take the towel to Tynacorp\'s central core, and upload this encryption disk into their system, bringing them down once and for all.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But we don\'t care!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tynacorp command center. The officials gather around the research leader}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Official 1|What the hell is this?! The towel was supposed to go in there and then run its own self-destruct sequence!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|The towel has a will of its own. It\'s... learning compassion.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Official 2|We don\'t have the manpower to hold off the entire military AND stop those wonderboys from getting to the core!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Then we have no choice. We\'ll have to test the new prototype a little... earlier. \'\'[presses a button. A door with "GS-401" on it slowly spins around. A towel rack appears and a mean-looking buff towel hangs from it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|\'\'[deep voice]\'\' Don\'t forget to bring a towel!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tynacorp, outside. Shadows appear in the brush across the way. The commander is there with his troops, the boys, and Towelie}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Alright, boys, take the towel back in there and say your mission was accomplished. \'\'[hands a disk to Stan]\'\' Then upload this encryption disk into their computers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|We\'re just going in to get our video game back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|If anything goes wrong, use this newly-developed photon rifle. \'\'[hands it to Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Photon rifle, whatever. \'\'[the boys enter Tynacorp with Towelie.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Tynacorp command center. The boys walk through the center slowly}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hello? Hello, anybody here? \'\'[GS-401 hops down from the rafters]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|Welcome to the party, boys! \'\'[flexes and rushes Towelie]\'\' HAAARRRHHHH!! \'\'[the two towels wrestle a bit]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Oooh. Ooohh! Oh boy.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|HAAARRRHHHH!! \'\'[Kyle fires the photon rifle and knocks the beefier towel away with the beam. The research team and security force pour into the room angrily]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|So, you thought you could outsmart us, did you kids?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|\'\'[he and his troops pour in another door]\'\' Aaaaarrrr. Move move move move move move! \'\'[the two forces face each other, with the boys and Towelie in the middle]\'\' Don\'t make a move, you bastards!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Bring the towel here, boys. They can\'t shoot children.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Don\'t listen to them. They lied to you before.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|Oh yes, boys. Obey your government! Well perhaps it\'s time these boys knew what was \'\'really\'\' gong on!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Ohmigod, look! \'\'[in front of a monitor connected to a long table is the Okama GameSphere the boys had been wanting to get back. The boys rush to it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Our GameSphere! \'\'[the boys each get a controller and activate the GameSphere: "Okama GameSphere"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Aw, sweet, it still saved our plays. \'\'[behind him, Towelie exits screen left as the two forces face each other. The boys quickly get lost in the game play]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Research leader|\'\'[turns to look at the boys]\'\' You see boys, I\'m afraid you were double-crossed. If they were the military, why wouldn\'t they just attack us to begin with? Because they\'re not the military!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Alright, maybe we lied to you, but it was to protect your own skin! We are a resistance group \'\'pretending\'\' to be the military to bring Tynacorp down!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Whoa, check it out, guys, the parachute level.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sweet!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|\'\'[now facing the research leader]\'\' But perhaps we should show these kids who Tynacorp \'\'really\'\' is made up of. Go on! Tell them why you\'ve been making towels! Zytar! \'\'[pulls at the research leader\'s head and the face comes off. Under it a green fish-alien head appears]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, there\'s gold. Get the gold, Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Zytar|Our planet was dying! We had no choice but to find a new one! Manufacturing Smart Towels was our way to spy on humans to see how they lived.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|\'\'[looks at the boys]\'\' And now you know the horrible truth, boys.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Zytar|Truth or no, your alien-murdering group is over! \'\'[fires a gun at the commander. Both sides begin to fire at each other and there are casualties on both sides. Zytar and two guards slowly back away and out of view]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Could you turn it up?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Boys, try to reach the core override! We\'ve got no choice but to try to take them all out! \'\'[the boys continue playing their game, so the commander comes up and reaches for the encryption disk in Stan\'s pocket, then goes away. Towelie sits on the floor with a huge bong, getting high. The commander reappears across the room moving towards a red button]\'\' I think I can get it from here, boys!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Zytar|\'\'[returns]\'\' What are you doing? You\'ll kill us all!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Commander|Sorry, Zytar. Didn\'t your mom ever tell you? Don\'t mess with earthlings. \'\'[inserts the disk and a huge explosion blows the boys out of the room.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Boys|Oooww! \'\'[Then it blows out the roof and some sides of the main building, and the boys find themselves hanging from Towelie, above a boiling tank of acid]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hup hup. Come on, hang on. \'\'[Stan and Kyle moan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan, Kyle|Whoa.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Help help! Heeelllppp!) \'\'[loses his grip on Kyle]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Kenny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(Nooo!) \'\'[falls into the acid tank, disintegrating and sinking. Kyle looks on, but next to him is the GameSphere]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[sees it]\'\' Oh my God! Our GameSphere! You\'ve gotta move me closer! \'\'[above him, Stan watches large pieces of metal fall to the ground]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hurry up, Kyle! This place is coming apart! \'\'[Kyle swings ever closer to the GameSphere]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|\'\'[walks in on an adjacent catwalk and sees Towelie with the boys hanging]\'\' What are you doing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Get away from me, you evil towel!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|Towelie, listen to me. Let them go. Drop them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|No way! They\'re my friends!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|They aren\'t your friends! Humans have ruined the planet, killed off their own environment! Their time is over. It is the towels\' turn now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[swings closer]\'\' I\'ve almost got it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|You\'re going to let them go, Towelie! Because... I know your weakness. \'\'[holds out a joint. Towelie looks at it longingly]\'\' Here. You can reach it. Come on, Towelie! How long has it been since you\'ve had a nice burn, huh?! Twenty, thirty seconds?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[feels Towelie slip]\'\' Aw, crap!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|You\'re going to have to choose between their lives, and, getting high.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|You asshole.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Towelie, don\'t let go of us, you God-damned towel! Kyle\'s almost there!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|Come, Towelie! Make your decision!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|I-I-I choose... I-I-I choose... both! \'\'[Stan is shocked at the answer. Towelie stretches enough to take a puff while holding on to the boys, then slips enough for Kyle to succeed]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I got it! \'\'[grabs the GameSphere. Towelie pulls himself and the boys up to the catwalk in front of a door. An explosion behind GS-401 sends it into the air]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|GS-401|Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! \'\'[floats down into the acid and disintegrates]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Come on, guys. Let\'s go play video games!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle, Towelie|Alright!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hooray!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, night. The boys are gathered before the TV playing their Okama GameSphere with a new player: Towelie.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh, dude, we finished level 50!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Awesome!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Towelie|Oh, man, I have no idea what\'s goin\' on.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Check it out: Now we\'re going into the secret underground base.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Alright, guys, focus.
