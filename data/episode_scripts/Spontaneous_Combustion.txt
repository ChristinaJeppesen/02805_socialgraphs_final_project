The temperature is steadily rising every day. I want you to find out why.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Mayor, I think I\'m a little overqualified for this. My scientific mind is best used on global problems.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|All right, all right. Name your price.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Ten thousand. I have to protect my talent.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Done. Just find out what\'s happening.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Don\'t worry, Mayor. I\'ll find the cause. Or else. Or else what?

Now, I\'m gonna go kill those guys!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Eric, I have to tell you something, and it\'s really gonna bum you out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|It\'s really gonna piss you off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|This is just a dream. You\'re still up on that cross.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[waking up]\'\' Oh, damnit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan\'s house, basement. A Cheesy Poofs commercial ends as Stan comes down the steps.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, where\'s the phone book?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Not now, Stanley. Without my scientific genius, the town is doomed. \'\'[Stan goes back up the stairs and exits.

Let\'s go to the phones. \'\'[beep]\'\' Caller, you\'re on the air.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, um, Jesus, after you got crucified, how long did it take you to die and resurrect?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Stan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|That\'s not the topic tonight. The topic is global warming.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Do you have an opinion on global warming?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Uh, it... sucks ass.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Okay! Thank you caller. Well, let\'s go to our first guest, Dr. Alphonse Mephesto. \'\'[Mephesto appears and sits]\'\' Thank you for coming. You claim to know the cause of global warming in South Park.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mephesto|I most certainly do! The cause of global warming is \'\'[brings out a picture of a man, with horns, mustache, and angry eyebrows drawn on]\'\' Randy Marsh! \'\'[Randy is stunned]\'\' It was Marsh\'s theory on spontaneous combustion that told everyone to fart all they want. Now all the methane from all those farts has ripped a hole in our ozone layer. We are all doomed to die!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Awww crap.}}\n{{ScriptScene|City Hall, the next day. The town is gathered clamoring for Randy to come out.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman|Go get him!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 1|We want answers!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 2|You\'ve killed us all!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 3|Someone\'s got to pay!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman|It\'s out of control.}}\n{{ScriptScene|inside the Mayor\'s office.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Boy, they\'re really pissed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, they\'re right. We should have known that all that methane could adversely affect the atmosphere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mayor McDaniels|Well, let\'s go talk to them. Stick by me. \'\'[turns and walks to the door. Randy follows.

Well I, for one, am not farting anymore! \'\'[he combusts and others gasp]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Uuuh, I- I\'ll try to find a solution.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 7|We don\'t want your solutions, phony!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 8|Give me that! \'\'[rips the Nobel medallion from Randy\'s neck, leaving the strap]\'\' Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 9|Damn you Marsh! Get out of town!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Townsman 10|You fraud! \'\'[two of the townsmen throw the statue onto Randy, who drags it away on his back.

Sorry.}}\n{{ScriptScene|News 4 Special Report.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|The spontaneous combustion problem escalates as more and more people go back to holding in all their farts. \'\'[a man combusts in front of his wife and child as he deposits a letter in a mailbox. A milk delivery man combusts after setting down a four-pack of milk. A boy combusts as he rides a bicycle]\'\' Meanwhile, the ozone layer continues to deplete as others refuse to hold in their farts for fear of combustion. As we all know, the cause for all of this is Randy Marsh, the son of a bitch who calls himself a scientist. We caught up with Mr. Marsh earlier today and he had this to say:}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I-I don\'t know what to say.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tom|What an asshole! I hate that guy, and so do you. And now, on to the weather. It\'s fucking hot, thanks to Randy Marsh, son of a bitch!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Everyone has gone to the Marsh house.

He put the hole in the ozone, and now we have skin cancer all over our hot bodies. Look. \'\'[she takes off her clothes and stands before Gerald dressed in thong panties. The other does the same, and he is in shock]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house. Stan and Kyle go to the basement. Randy cowers in a corner wrapped in a blanket.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What are you doing, dad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Stanley, I think its best you live with Kyle from now on.

People are dying, dad. You\'ve got to come up with a solution!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Not me. I\'m not a scientist, I\'m a hack.

I learned something from the Stations of the Cross.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|See, at first, Jesus was all like, "Why me?" And he was all pissed off and stuff. But then he saw that what mattered most was everybody else. So he stopped thinking about his own misery, and did what had to be done. Right as Jesus was dying, \'\'[performs a Vulcan greeting]\'\' he raised his hand and said, "The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|You\'re right, Stanley. You\'re absolutely right. \'\'[gets up and the boys go to the stairs]\'\' Hey, that Bible sounds like kind of a good book.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|It ain\'t bad.
