\n{{EpisodeScript|\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. The school is in an uproar. The students are tearing up their notebooks and littering the hallways with their papers.

An official sits behind a desks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Peter Galtman|My name is Peter Galtman. I am the head of the school calendar committee. \'\'[the people he\'s addressing are the parents and faculty of South Park Elementary]\'\' I\'ve decided that school will not celebrate Columbus Day this year. I realize this is a hot-button issue for many families, but one parent in particular has really swayed my opinion with his passion. Mr. Randy Marsh. Mr. Marsh pointed out to me the hypocrisy of glorifying a genocidal murderer, and Mr. Marsh is right now also working on having the Columbus statue taken down in Canyon City.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Canyon City, day. In the town square, a magnificent statue of Columbus stands with a globe in its left hand and a telescope in its right hand.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[runs up to the statue]\'\' Come on, everybody! Let\'s take this fuckin\' thing down! \'\'[kicks it and punches it]\'\' Yeah, yehah! \'\'[punches it some more, with no effect]\'\' Take it down! Columbus was a mass murderer! \'\'[people gather to watch as Randy climbs up to the statue\'s head]\'\' Tear it down! Tear it down! Yeah! \'\'[grunts as he tries to take it apart]\'\' Hey, it\'s not working. \'\'[tugs at the head and grunts]\'\' We almost got it, guys! Come on, throw the rope, Stan! \'\'[a rope flies up towards him, with noose ready to go. He catches it and wraps it around the head]\'\' Good, that\'s good! Hit the gas, Nelson! \'\'[Peter Nelson pulls away with the rope tied to his car]\'\' We got it, everybody! To hell with you, Columbus! You guh-whoa! Whoa! \'\'[the statue topples to the right and falls apart. Randy falls with it, but isn\'t hurt]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, evening. Stan sits on the couch watching TV when he gets a call from Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey dude.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude! Did you know it\'s your dad did who\'s getting the school to cancel Columbus Day?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah. Dude, I don\'t know what\'s going on. He\'s really serious about this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well, you\'ve gotta do something. If you get him to back down, maybe the school will reconsider.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I can\'t get him to back down.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stan, I have to deal with my mom doing shit like this all the time, but she\'s never tried to take away a holiday. I\'m your best friend, but I can\'t have your back when the guys find out about this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I\'ll try, okay. \'\'[glances up for a moment]\'\' Ok-I, I gotta go. \'\'[Randy walks up with his laptop and phone and sits next to Stan]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Okay, Stan, you got your phone? I need to call everyone on this list. They all live in the same city.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, listen: you need to ease off a little here.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Stan, it\'s not right that people celebrate a man who wiped out millions of people for his own glory! \'\'[puts his phone up to his right ear]\'\' Let\'s go! \'\'[places his first call]\'\' Hello? Is this uh \'\'[checks his laptop screen]\'\' Howard Peterson? You live in Columbus, Ohio, is that correct? Yeah? You racist piece of shit. You heard me. You\'re an intolerant pig. Oh, you\'re not? You just choose to live in a city named for ethnic cleansing. No, fuck you! Rename your city, asshole! Hello? \'\'[evidently, the recipient hung up]\'\' Okay, next one, come on. Get calling, Stan!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, come on. We all get your point, but don\'t you think you\'re overdoing it?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|You have to overdo it in today\'s society Stan. You can\'t be nuanced and subtle anymore or else critics go "Wow, what was the point of that?" \'\'[places the next calls]\'\' Hi, Francis Melman? Hey, how are you, you fuckin\' racist?}}\n{{ScriptScene|An even more impressive statue of Columbus, lit up at night.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field Reporter|\'\'[the camera zooms out to include him]\'\' Christopher Columbus. Explorer, pioneer. Is he someone who should be appreciated, or was he just a douche? For years, Columbus Circle has been a landmark and photogenic intersection in New York City. So it came as a surprise when someone defecated on the statue earlier today. I\'m joined now by the man who did the actual defecating, Mr. Randy Marsh of South Park, Colorado. \'\'[walks up to Randy, who\'s wearing an "I poop on New York" T-shirt, "poop on" replaced by a small picture of him pooping on "New York"]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Good evening.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field Reporter|Mr. Marsh, you took a dump on a beloved statue that\'s been an icon here in the city for years. What was your reasoning?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Well, I just have a problem with the racist people of this city. Yeehaw, \'\'[gets into a hick, redneck accent]\'\' I\'m from New York! I drive around a big circle n\' celebrates a guy who murdered Native Americans! Shoowee!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field Reporter|So you\'re doing this because of indigenous peoples and their feelings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I don\'t care if people get indigenous, I\'ll crap all over their statues! I\'m the one who\'s indigenous that this landmark even exists!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Field Reporter|Aah, aaah, bah, back to you, Tom.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, lunch time. As kids sit down for lunch, a girl walks by with a tear streaming down her face. She sniffles. At the boys\' table are seated Tolkien, Jimmy, Kyle, Clyde, Cartman, Kenny, and Butters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|It ain\'t right. They make you work like a dog and then they just tear away your one day off in October like you\'re a piece of trash!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[shows up at table with his lunch]\'\' Hey guys. \'\'[takes a seat between Tolkien and Jimmy]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Boo! Boo! Nobody likes you, Stan!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Look, I tried talking to him, alright? He\'s just really against all the things Columbus did.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimmy|Does anyone know what Columbus actually did?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah. In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus got us a day off skewl. That\'s what matters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No! No, wait guys. Maybe that\'s it. When I\'m dealing with my mom, sometimes it works to be on her side for a minute. Maybe we should find out all the things people find offensive about Columbus and-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|And totally act like we care. I like it, Kyle.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I\'ll just look up Columbus, offensive, inflammatory-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, this is sweet. It\'s like that movie where the dude pretended to be on the monsters\' side? You know, with the guy and the chick that had the wife beater on, but her boobs were sweaty so you could see them? \'\'[Kyle checks the search results]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|I love that movie.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah, this is a lot like that. What\'d you find, Kyle?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Nnnothing.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Dang it! There\'s nothing?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stan, can I talk to you for a minute? \'\'[leaves the table, and Stan follows]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[now out of the loop]\'\' What? What? What the hell was that?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, Randy\'s study. Randy is typing up something on his computer. Stan and Kyle walk in.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hey Dad?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Not now, Stan. I\'m working on a proposal to change British Columbia to just British.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|But Dad, Kyle found a picture on Instagram. \'\'[shows Randy the pictures]\'\' It pretty much looks like you dressed as Columbus at a Halloween party. \'\'[Randy notices the picture, now shown close up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Where did you get that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|If you hate Columbus so much, why did you dress like him?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Look, that was a long time ago, okay? It\'s just a dumb Halloween costume.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah but, \'\'[goes through the pictures he pulled off Instagram]\'\' here\'s you dressed as Columbus at a formal dinner, and here\'s you dressed as Columbus at a football game, and you as Columbus on St. Patrick\'s Day...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Look, I was younger! We were all... younger. It was another time. You have to understand, it was 2013. Everyone was stoked on Columbus back then.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, but Dad, you seem to be really stoked on Columbus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|If you guys found those pictures online, it\'s only a matter of time before everyone else does. People won\'t care about what I do now. They\'ll just see me as a thoughtless, indigenous son of a bitch.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, living room, some time later. Sharon walks up to him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy, do you mind cleaning out the garage like I asked?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[moping]\'\' What\'s the point, Sharon? Soon they\'re gonna be coming after me.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Ach. \'\'[turns around and walks away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|\'\'[a series of faces appear on tv, and Randy is interested]\'\' Hey, you!

You might be surprised.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cyclist|\'\'[at Santa Monica Beach, stops]\'\' I thought I was just a standard white guy, but DNAandMe showed that I\'m actually 4.2% Cherokee Indian.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman 1|\'\'[doing curls]\'\' Turns out I\'m not totally white.

I\'m a victim of oppression. \'\'[smiles]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve|\'\'[seated at his desk]\'\' I used to get in trouble for always using the N word.

With everyone enjoying the ambiance, Randy comes down from the second floor, looks around, then goes back upstairs.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy\'s study. He goes inside the darkened room and closes the door.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Alright, everyone\'s here. Let\'s do this. \'\'[in the room with him is a Native American (Bill), whom he walks up to. He opens a desk drawer and pulls out some money]\'\' Here you go, just like I said. A hundred dollars cash. No questions asked. Are we good? \'\'[Bill just looks him over]\'\' Good. No talking. Perfect. Okay, let\'s get this over with. \'\'[pulls Bill\'s face towards his own and gives him a long, passionate French kiss. Bill gets more and more surprised the longer the kiss continues.

I think we\'re ready to get started.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|DNA test administrator|\'\'[holding a DNAandMe kit]\'\' Ahah, Mr. Marsh, you know, none of this was really necessary. For DNAandMe testing you can just swab the inside of your mouth yourself and send it in the mail.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, I know, but I just, I was really excited, wanted everyone to witness my test.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|DNA test administrator|Well, to each their own I suppose. \'\'[opens the kit and pulls out a swab]\'\' All right, open wide. \'\'[Randy opens up and hums as the DNAandMe doctor moves the swab around the inside of his cheek.

I\'m very interested to see [begins speaking more slowly] what those results have to say.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A house, day. A woman sits in a rocking chair knitting a scarf. A cordless phone rings.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Peter Galtman|\'\'[answers the phone]\'\' Galtman residence.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Masked voice|Listen to me carefully.

Isn\'t that interesting?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Cross-breeding? You mean rape. You\'re telling me that my ancestors were raped, and then eradicated by you? You maniacs! \'\'[kicks the chair out of the way]\'\' The earth wasn\'t big enough for Neanderthals, so your ancestors just got rid of them, huh?! Well TO HELL WITH ALL OF YOU!! \'\'[knocks over a tool cart and leaves]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, night. Randy pulls into his driveway and walks towards the house in a sad state. He goes inside, closes the door, and is surprised at what he sees. Mr. Galtman stands with the four boys near the dining room.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Galtman|Well well, Mr. Marsh. I\'d like to have a word, please.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[walks up to him and punches him out with one blow]\'\' You find this funny, Galtman!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Galtman|What\'d I do?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Nobody had the guts to tell me what happened to my people, huh? Get the hell out of here! \'\'[opens the front door and Bill is back]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|I brought my parents over so you could meet them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Waww God!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|Don\'t worry. My parents are very okay and cool with us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Who the hell is that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yeah, sure! Everyone gang up on the Neanderthal! Isn\'t it funny!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bill|Randy, you must face who you are. Stop pretending, Randy. For once, just allow yourself to feel.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[moves away from the others]\'\' You\'re right. \'\'[Galtman stands up and they all look at Randy again]\'\' You\'re right. It\'s only now, when everyone is being so indigenous to me, that I realized... how indigenous I\'ve been acting all along. I thought being a victim would solve all my problems. But being a victim has a down side too. \'\'[walks up to Galtman]\'\' Mr. Galtman, I haven\'t been honest. It\'s time for us all... to be honest.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day. A stage, mic, and podium have been prepared at the school entrance, and Randy is at the podium. Before him are the faculty, parents and students of the school.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What is a holiday? It\'s a day off work, yes. A day off school. But holidays are also meant to be a time to reflect. Today, I\'m happy to announce that the school calendar committee is reinstating the day off. \'\'[the kids cheer]\'\' But instead of glorifying anyone, Let us make it a holiday about the negative feelings that we all sometimes feel. Say what we\'re really thinking so we can move on. And so, the second Monday in October will still be a holiday, but instead of Columbus Day, it will be for ripping on each other and tearing each other down. And we will call it Indigenous Peoples Day. For perhaps if we all do it at the same time, we won\'t be so indigenous the rest of the year. And since this is the second Monday of October, let\'s all embrace the new meaning of the holiday starting right now.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Dave|Do you even know what indigenous means, you freakin\' idiot?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|That\'s the spirit, Dave. Come on, everybody, let\'s just all be totally indigenous. Come on!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kurt|Who the hell let this guy talk to the school council?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Good one Kurt. Your wife\'s a whore. Come on, everyone! Indigenous People\'s Day! Let\'s go for it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Woman 2|Shut up and get off the podium! \'\'[people begin to leave]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Okay, I will in a second, fatso. All right, who else? Come on! Get it out of your system! Happy Indigenous People\'s Day, everyone.
