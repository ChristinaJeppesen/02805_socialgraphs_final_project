And being the genius that he was, Mr. Hubbard invented a way to get rid of those bad thetans. \'\'[stops by a picture of a portable blue machine with two cylindrical grips plugged into the back]\'\' This is called an E-meter. It\'s the main tool of Scientology. You just grab a hold of these handles as I talk you through past experiences in your life.

It all began 75 million years ago. Back then there was a galactinc federation of planets which was ruled over by the evil Lord Xenu.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Xenu|Ho ho ho ho ho ho.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|President|Xenu thought his galaxy was overpopulated, \'\'[Xenu gives his orders]\'\' and so he rounded up countless aliens from all different planets, \'\'[the roundup is shown]\'\' and then had those aliens frozen. \'\'[one by one, the aliens are frozen]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Xenu|\'\'[laughing over his plan]\'\' Wa ha ha ha!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|President|The frozen alien bodies were loaded onto Xenu\'s galactic cruisers, which looked like DC-8s, except with rocket engines. The cruisers then took the frozen alien bodies to our planet, to Earth, and dumped them into the volcanoes of Hawaii. \'\'[a shot of the frozen aliens encased in ice being dropped from the orange cruisers]\'\' The aliens were no longer frozen, they were dead. The \'\'souls\'\' of those aliens, however, lived on, and all \'\'floated up\'\' towards the sky. But the evil Lord Xenu had prepared for this.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Xenu|Wa ha ha ha!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|President|Xenu didn\'t \'\'want\'\' their souls to return! And so he built giant soul-catchers in the sky! \'\'[the soul-catchers are shown]\'\' The souls were taken to a huge soul brain-washing facility, which Xenu had ALSO built on Earth. \'\'[the souls are watching a movie screen with 3D glasses]\'\' There the souls were forced to watch days of brainwashing material \'\'[Egyptian gods, Jesus carrying the Cross, and a bronze Buddha statue are shown]\'\' which tricked them into believing a false reality. Xenu then released the alien souls, which roamed the earth aimlessly in a fog of confusion. At the dawn of man, the souls finally found bodies which they can grab onto. They attached themselves to all mankind, which still to this day causes all our fears, our confusions, and our problems. \'\'[Stan looks at the president, a bit awed]\'\' L.
