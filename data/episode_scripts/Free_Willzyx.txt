Sweet!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, Jambu is the best! \'\'[Jambu returns and takes a quick dive towards the bottom of its tank.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|Now get ready for Jambu\'s next trick. \'\'[Jambu leaps up into the air, performs a somersault, and strikes the water with its fluke, again sending water onto the boys]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Haha! I\'m totally wet! This is awesome!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|\'\'[shown as a brunet, with long sideburns]\'\' How about that, folks! A full body flip! And now, Kelly\'s gonna show us how she makes Jambu do his tricks. \'\'[a blonde woman in a wet suit steps forward, kneels down by the edge of the small dock she\'s on, and strikes the water three times with her hand]\'\' When Kelly slaps her hand three times, Jambu comes to her. Jambu will stay and wait until Kelly gives him a command. \'\'[she signals for him to go forward, and she dives in after him]\'\' Oh, what trick are we gonna see? Get those cameras ready! \'\'[Kelly dives and gets into position. Jambu circles the tank, then returns and pops up out of the water with Kelly on his nose. She then waves her arms signaling she\'s fine.]\'\' That\'s Kelly riding on Jambu\'s nose! \'\'[aside, to his partner Mike in the booth]\'\' I wish Kelly would ride on \'\'my\'\' nose. \'\'[they both laugh.

I love rockets, but I can\'t see them \'cause I\'m stuck in this tank. \'\'[he and Mike both laugh, then he shushes Mike and returns to the mic]\'\'. You know, someday, I wish that I could go up in space in a rocket ship.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Why? Aren\'t you happy here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jambu|I try to be, but my wish is to one day blast off in a big rocket ship!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|This is amazing! But wait right here.

The orca whale talks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(What the fuck are you talking about?)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|I went up to Jambu\'s tank and I tapped three times like the trainer did.

It\'s because I\'m very very sick, you see.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Sick?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|I don\'t believe it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jambu|Yes, because I\'m not used to the earth atmosphere. You see, my name is actually Willzy-x, and I\'m from the moon! \'\'[Brian clicks off his mic, Mike laughs, and they both crack up]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mike|The moon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jambu|The... that\'s where all orca whales are from. If I don\'t get back to the moon, I\'m going to die.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You live on the moon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jambu|I used to. I wish I could return and dance in the moon castle with my wife and three children again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh my God...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Why don\'t you just tell the people here at the sea park?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jambu|I can\'t tell them, because they\'re evil communists from the Horsehead Nebula. They want to kill all us zypods, so they keep us in these horrible tanks and make us perform.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|That\'s terrible!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mike|Dude, dude, the boss is coming!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jambu|Uh, uh, sorry boys, I can\'t talk anymore.

Let\'s do it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|The whale\'s name is Willzy-x, and he told us he\'s dying on our planet.

In between shows at his orca tank.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Hey, that whale talked to me too. After everyone left the show I walked up to the glass and he started talking.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Weh-well, why didn\'t you tell anybody?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|Well I thought I was crazy. He said my dad was gonna sneak into my room naked one night and beat me up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Well you\'re NOT crazy. The whale talked to all of us. And he needs our help getting him home.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|...So it\'s true.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Nobody else is going to help him, you guys.

In order to make our plan work, we\'re going to need the pool from Clyde\'s back yard, Timmy\'s wheelchair, the Russian government, and all of our skateboards.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Denver Sea Park, night. The boys arrive at the park. A security guard whistles as he patrols the grounds. Behind him a wheelchair is heard. He pulls out a flashlight and swings it around to highlight everywhere he looks. Timmy and the gang roll by quietly, the pool riding on the skateboards.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Timmy|\'\'[softly]\'\' Timmihhhhh... \'\'[The guard looks back just after they pass by, so he just missed them. The boys reach Jambu\'s tank]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Craig, Token, get the slings ready. \'\'[Cartman, Clyde, and a third boy position a ladder into place.

Brian and Mike arrive at work.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|Dude, did you see that episode of \'\'Trading Spouses\'\' last night? That was insane. Yeah, well ha- whoa. What the hell? \'\'[people mill around by Jambu\'s tank. Police officers move about. The park\'s owner talks to the guard]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Owner|How could you not have seen anything?? It\'s a \'\'whale\'\', for Christ\'s sake!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard|It must have been taken while I was going to the bathroom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Owner|Were you in there for three hours?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard|\'\'[hurt, turns away and shields himself]\'\' Don\'t yell at me! \'\'[Brianand Mike arrive from the booth]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|What happened?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kelly|Somebody kidnapped Jambu, took him right out of the park.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mike|What? How?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Guard|\'\'[raises his head up long enough to say]\'\' I DON\'T KNOW!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sergeant|All right, people, it\'s obvious we\'re dealing with a highly intelligent animal-rights group.

Let me see that. \'\'[reads the note]\'\' We\'re taking Willzy-x home to the moon.

It was really funny! We\'ve just... \'\'[lets him go]\'\' we\'ve just gotta make this right ourselves.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mike|How?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|We\'ve gotta track down those kids. Before the police do!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Moscow, day, the Kremlin. Inside, Putin and members of his staff meet in a boardroom.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Putin|Comrades, I\'m afraid our situation is dire.

We don\'t have that kind of money.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Putin|...What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|But you need to understand: we have a whale here that needs to get back to his family on the moon.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Putin|Goddamnit it is prank call again! \'\'[his staff leaves]\'\' Kiss my ass, George Bush! This is not funny! \'\'[slams the phone onto the base]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|What happened?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|They want twenty million dollars.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Twenty million? Just to go to the dumb moon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Craig|That was it? That was you guys\' whole plan?
