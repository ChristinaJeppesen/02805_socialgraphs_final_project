Two roosters are set to fight each other with cards. The boys make it to ringside. An announcer calls the play-by-play}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Scrambles plays a Black Swamp mana card.

That is Peel from Reality! Fugitive Wizard is literally torn apart from the battleground!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|The boys|Whoa!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|The mana is flying now as both roosters play sorcery spells! It\'s Mass Calcify against Into the Void!}}\n{{ScriptScene|M Burger, next day.

I mean, they were goin\' at it pretty hard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, maybe that\'s just kind of what they do naturally.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Guys, I think maybe Kenny\'s a little hurt because he was the big Magic champion, and now chickens are stealing his thunder.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(No.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Huh? A little bit?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kenny|(NO.)}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, you know what we should do? We should all go in on a rooster.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Dude, totally.

Harris|Let\'s cut the crap, huh? We know there\'s an illegal cock Magic ring going on in town, we just wanna know who\'s leading it.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|What\'s cock Magic?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Harris|Right. Roosters are being forced against their will to play "Magic: the Gathering," and you know nothing about it because you\'re \'white\'. Let\'s git something straight: cock Magic isn\'t an Asian thing or a Mexican thing. White people do it too, if they\'re poor enough. You got a junked car in your front yard, Mr. McCormick. Care to tell us where the cock Magic fights are being held?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stuart|I don\'t go to any cock Magic fights!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Harris|Do you have any sympathy at all for the animals, Mr. McCormick? Can you imagine being kept in a small cage, barely able to turn around, and then finally let out only to be blasted by Arctic ice spells and legendary creature cards? It\'s illegal, and it\'s wrong, and anyone I find involved with this filth is goin\' down!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, day. The boys are on the sofa and Randy is lecturing them on Magic: the Gathering. Or on cock Magic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Now I don\'t wanna lecture anybody, but what you boys are getting involved in is dangerous!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, it\'s not that big a deal.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|It is a big deal, okay?! People can get hurt! Believe it or not I was into Cock Magic back in college.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You were?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Yes, so I\'m not some fuddy-duddy who doesn\'t get it! I just wanna make sure if you boys do it, you do it right, and safely. \'\'[whips out a handkerchief, and drums begin to play. Randy places the hankey over his pants and begins a demonstration of cock magic, as he knew it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Randy\'s cock magic. It moves left, then right quickly. Then it pops up from behind the hankey, then pops under}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dad, that\'s not, that\'s not cock Magic.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh? Not impressed? How about this? \'\'[makes his penis pop out right, left, down... up, left. Stan hides his face in his hand while his friends are speechless]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|A run-down house, much like Kenny\'s, day. The boys approach it and ring the buzzer. This place has an intercom}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Voice|What is it?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hello? We\'re looking to buy a rooster that can play "Magic: The Gathering"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Voice|Never heard of cock Magic, or roosters.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Uhhh, we aren\'t cops or anything.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Breeder|\'\'[The voice, opens up and lets them in]\'\' Come on to the back, don\'t mind the smell. \'\'[he takes the boys to his barn and shows them around]\'\' We only deal in the highest quality poultry Planeswalkers. Are you looking for a New Hampshire or a Cornish breed?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|We don\'t... really know the difference.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Breeder|Well, your New Hampshire broiler chickens are the best for white mana. These here have been raised to play mostly protection spells and do well with sorcery cards. And here you got your green mana necromancers. Lots of earthy growth and hindering incantations that are good against blue- or black-stacked decks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Do you think they\'re happy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Breeder|Do I think they\'re happy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, like, do you think they mind being made to play "Magic: The Gathering"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Breeder|\'\'[thinks a moment]\'\' They\'re fuckin\' chickens.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Well, our friend here has some animal-rights concerns. Do you have any free-range chickens?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Breeder|Free-range chickens are primarily control deck players that slow the game down with board control cards.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aw, screw the free-range chickens, huh, Kenny?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[off-screen]\'\' Hey, how about this little guy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Breeder|That one\'s kind of young. I don\'t even know what kinda cards he prefers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Then he\'s perfect for us.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|What should we name him, Kenny? I know. How about "McNuggets"?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey McNuggets. You wanna come play for us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[mimicking a rooster]\'\' "Yes I do, you guys." \'\'[normally]\'\' Oh wow, did you hear him, Kenny?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh house, day. Sharon is in the master bedroom folding clothes when Shelly appears}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Shelly|Mom, will you tell Dad to get out of the bathroom?! He\'s been in there for an hour!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Marsh bathroom, moments later. A drummer is heard inside}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Randy?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|\'\'[lounge voice]\'\' Hey! Oh! Oh thank you!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|\'\'[Sharon pounds on the door]\'\' Randy, what are you doing?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Oh! Nothing, Sharon.

Now you know that I was one of the best back in college.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|I know. That\'s why you got kicked out of college.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Because people didn\'t understand! People were afraid, Sharon! But now culture has caught up. And even our son is discovering what cock magic has to offer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Sharon|Stanley??}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|People are going to do it, Sharon. And it\'s up to the professionals to make sure it\'s handled the right way. Hoh! \'\'[a hankey drapes his erect penis]\'\' Oh my gosh! \'\'[pulls the hankey off and the penis is back in his pants. He smiles, she walks away, his smile fades, and he goes back into the bathroom and shuts the door]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|City Wok, Friday night. Tonight, it\'s McNuggets against a different rooster.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Reuben casts Silklash Spider. Silklash Spider can block as if it had Flying!

Fight!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You can do it, McNuggets! \'\'[the crowd argues around them]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Quiet, please.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Someone|I think I\'ll bet on the next one.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Announcer|Waaiitt! \'\'[the crowd gets quiet]\'\' McNuggets has cast Punishing Fire, absorbing the Geistflame and dealing two damage to the opponent!

I mean, no offense to Kenny, but that shit made regular "Magic: The Gathering" look like girls\' volleyball.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Promoter|\'\'[comes out behind the boys with two bodyguards]\'\' Excuse me. That was pretty impressive down there. You boys have a nice cock.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Thank you so very much.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Promoter|I\'ve never seen a rooster throw down spells with such raw brutality. How would you like to move him up to the big time?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You mean there\'s more to this?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Promoter|Oh, yes. And I\'m not talking about the basement of some seedy Chinese restaurant, I\'m talking about the basement of a well-established Chinese franchise. Saturday night, here\'s the address. \'\'[again Kyle takes the slip of paper]\'\' Let\'s see what kind of money your cock can really make.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Gee, thanks!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You hear that, McNuggets?

You know, we live in a world of brutality and violence. And some people think there\'s no room for wonder anymore. But just for a moment I want you to think one thing. \'\'[dances over to a stool nearby with a box sitting on it]\'\' Whatever you believe is real, is real. \'\'[pulls out a hankey, then goes back to center stage and shows there\'s nothing odd about it. He unzips his zipper and puts the hankey on his penis. He gets a rubber band and ties the hankey around the penis. Next he moves his hand around and his penis rises in response, as if his hands had some magnetic power to them. Suddenly, the penis takes flight and goes around several times. He holds up a large ring and the penis flies through it flawlessly. He turns around and the song "Barbie Girl" plays. He drops his pants, dances a bit, then turns around with a small curtain over his legs. The penis peaks out to the right, up, left, and then the head of René Dif appears popping out to the right]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|René Dif|<poem><i>Come on Barbie, let\'s go party.</i></poem> \'\'[Randy pushes it gently behind the curtain again, then he squats just long enough to get his pants back up and remove the curtain. Then he hops around. He hops back to the stool and gets some body lotion to lubricate his penis with. Then he pretends to stroke his penis and a bouquet of flowers pops up. He tosses the bouquet into the crowd and a woman catches it]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Spectator 3|Ewww! \'\'[throws the bouquet away]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Alright, for this last bit I\'m gonna need a volunteer. Anybody?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Harris|I\'ll volunteer.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|Alright, come on up here. \'\'[Harris goes up]\'\' What\'s your name?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Det. Harris|I\'m Detective Harris, South Park Police.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|All right, a hand for Detective Harris! \'\'[applause. This provides a distraction by which some spectators leave silently]\'\' You know, if there\'s one thing I could leave you all with, it\'s this. Let cock magic be done by the professionals. \'\'[grabs a tank of liquid nitrogen]\'\' Sir? \'\'[gives it to Harris, who holds it. Drumroll. Randy takes a funnel and puts one end on his penis, then motions for Harris to pour the nitrogen into the funnel. A few seconds later, the funnel comes off to reveal a frozen penis. Randy takes a gun out and shoots it to bits. Harris is stunned. Randy walks over to him and smiles. All of a sudden, the penis comes out of Harris\' mouth. Randy takes it and puts it into his pants. Harris smiles. Only four cops remain and they clap. The crowd and the other cops have left.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Elementary, day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|It was so hardcore you guys.
