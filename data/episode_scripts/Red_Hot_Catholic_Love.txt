If I\'m gonna raise my son to be atheist, I don\'t want him saying "under God" every day at school. That could really damage him.

Be a good person. \'\'[the Williams are watching]\'\' That\'s it! And when you start turning the stories into literal translations of hierarchies and power, well... Well, you end up with this. \'\'[shows off the ruins, and then the Queen Spider, then the Gelgameks]\'\' People are losing faith because they don\'t see how what \'\'you\'ve\'\' turned the religion into applies to them! They\'ve lost touch with any idea of any kind of religion, and when they \'\'have\'\' no mythology to try and live their lives by, well, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths! \'\'[The Tweeks are watching.
