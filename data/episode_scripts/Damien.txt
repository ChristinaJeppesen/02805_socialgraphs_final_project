Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on \'\'me\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Damien gets an idea.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Forum.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Buffer|In the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., \'\'Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd cheers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Buffer|And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd now cheers for Satan. Jesus turns and glowers at them, and they shrink away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Buffer|Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet\'s get ready to rumbllllle!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Referee|Okay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The bell rings.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s birthday party. A carny does tricks. Damien enters with Pip in tow.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Hey! What the hell do you think \'\'you\'re\'\' doing here?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Yeah, you weren\'t invited, new kid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|And neither were you, Pip!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Yes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren\'t invited, but-}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Damien|Wait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party.}}\n{{ScriptScene|His eyes flare up again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ominous voice|<poem><i>Rectus... dominus...</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptScene|Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Small demons grab Pip.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Ominous voice|<poem><i>... Sancti... cheesy poofs...</i></poem>}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Aaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He is launched like a rocket.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He gives off fireworks.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wow!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whoa, that was cool!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The children, Bebe, Wendy, and Clyde among them, look up and are duly impressed. They applaud.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hey, you\'re not such a bad guy after all, Damien.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Yeah. Come on in and join the party. \'\'[Damien is pleased]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Forum, round 2. Satan and Jesus meet up. Satan gives Jesus a hard left, throwing him against the ropes. The crowd cheers. Jesus looks back, and they are silent. Jesus turns to fight, but receives a blow in the abdomen, again stumbling to the ropes. Satan gives him a left cross. Satan stands back, and Jesus\' halo now flutters all over the place.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Come on, you little wuss, \'\'fight!\'\' Throw a punch!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s birthday party. He is now opening his presents.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. \'\'[Stan leaves.]\'\' And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it\'s the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.\'\'[She leaves.]\'\' Oh, look what Kyle got me? It\'s the Red Mega-... \'\'Ants\'\' In The Pants? \'\'Ants In The Pan- ANTS IN THE PANTS?! [Thumps the table in anger.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|It\'s a game, dude. It\'s really fun.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You son of a bitch! \'\'[Lunges towards Kyle.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[As he is pinned by Cartman.]\'\' Aaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|You were supposed to get me the red Mega Man, eh! Now I can\'t make the Ultra Mega Mega Man, you dirty cheap-ass piece of crap! \'\'[Slapping him around by now.]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|They were all out of \'em dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|I hate you! I want you to die! Die!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Aah! Aaaaaggghhhhh!!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'[Sobbing.]\'\' Aaaaaaaa!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman gets up and moves toward the center of the yard.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That\'s it! Party is over!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids look glum.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Everybody go home!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He turns the party switch off. Music slows to a stop, everything goes dark, and the banner floats away.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Get the hell out, I said! The party\'s over! Get out goddammt!!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The kids exit the backyard as Cartman announces that the party is over.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan and Kyle stop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Whoa, dude, you need to mellow out!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Take your stupid Ants In The Pants with you!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Throws it at Kyle, who is felled by it. The kids regroup in front of the house.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Damien|Wow. That kid has some emotional problems.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|[swings his left arm] Aaanh, he does this all the time.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Come on, children! We can \'\'still\'\' catch the end of the fight!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Pip descends from above.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Pip|Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.}}\n{{ScriptScene|South Park Forum, a later round. Satan gives Jesus a fierce left, launching him into the air and against the ropes again. Jesus comes forward, and Satan gives him a right to the face.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Oh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Backs up helplessly.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Fight, dammit!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Gives him another right to the face.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Oow! \'\'[Satan pick him up]\'\' Ooooooh!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan throws him against the rope, then gives him another right to the face. Jesus now has a swollen left eye.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Stan, Kyle, and Kenny approach Jesus\' corner.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! \'\'[The round ends.]\'\' You\'ve \'\'got\'\' to \'\'fight\'\', Jesus.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Why? What\'s the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on \'\'Satan\'\'. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I\'m completely forsook.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|\'\'Some\'\'body bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that \'\'one\'\' person still had money on you.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|It doesn\'t matter. He\'s way too strong for me anyway-I give up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Goddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Nancy Kerrigan wouldn\'t give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. \'\'[Kyle looks at him.]\'\' She wouldn\'t stop until she was Number One!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Uuuuh. Stan?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Nancy Kerrigan wouldn\'t \'\'settle\'\' for second-best!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|She wouldn\'t quit until she brought home the gold!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Stan!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[Turning to Kyle.]\'\' What?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Nancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[Thinks a moment.]\'\' ... Really?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, dude!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Hoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus takes a ladleful of water from a pail next to him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You know, somebody once said. \'Don\'t try to be a great man, just be a man\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|... Who said that?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'You\'\' did, Jesus.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jesus ponders these words as he looks at Satan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|You\'re right, Stan. Thank you, boys!}}\n{{ScriptScene|He gets up as the next round begins and fights without his halo.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Wow. Did he say that in the Bible?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Nah, I saw it on \'\'\'Star Trek\'\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Hmmm.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan takes a couple of swings at Jesus, but Jesus ducks them.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Come on, sissy. Hit me! \'\'Hit me!\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Okay, pal. \'\'You asked\'\' for it!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd looks on as Jesus prepares to punch Satan. Jesus delivers the blow, but nothing happens. The sound of escaping air is heard. Stan just buries his head in his hands in disbelief.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan protecting his ribs.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Ooooooh, you got me.}}\n{{ScriptScene|He drops flat on his back.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Referee|One... Two... Three...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|No way! He barely touched him!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Referee|... Seven... Eight.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan opens his left eye, then closes it again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Referee|... Nine... Ten. You\'re out!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The match ends, and Jesus jumps up in victory.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan, Kyle|Our Savior!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Michael Buffer|The winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan pops right back up.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Hey, he isn\'t hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Yeah!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|Fools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don\'t you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd wonders.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|\'\'Me\'\', you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan dances out of the ring.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Father Maxi|I don\'t believe this!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Yeah, what a mean thing to do!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Satan|\'\'[Now on the Forum floor.]\'\' Farewell, fools!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Man, that guy is a \'\'jerk\'\'.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Satan dances away and Stan enters the ring.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|\'\'[Over the microphone.]\'\' Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Garrison|Boy, did we get screwed.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chef|Jesus, we\'re sorry. Can you ever forgive us?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jesus|Aw heck. \'\'[Puts his halo back on.]\'\' Do I have a choice?}}\n{{ScriptScene|The crowd cheers with relief.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Well, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, \'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there\'s a rare duck-billed platypus!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Kenny is highlighted.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Jimbo|Ih-it\'s comin\' right for us!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Jimbo pulls out a semi-automatic and fires away at Kenny. Kenny is soon on the floor with his head blown off.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Oh my God, they killed Kenny.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|You bastard!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Damien|Well, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you.}}\n{{ScriptScene|Rats swarm all over Kenny\'s head.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|You\'re leaving already?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Damien|I have to. My dad\'s always on the move.}}\n{{ScriptScene|The rats leave also.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Wow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Parents can be so cruel. Don\'t they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?}}\n{{ScriptScene|Cartman\'s backyard. He\'s the only one at the picnic table, and it\'s still full of food. Cartman looks full, though.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Liane|More pie, hon?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Eh... n-yeh. No... more... pie... eheh... seriously.}}\n}}\n{{Episodemedia01|episode=8}}\n[[zh:撒旦之子达米安/剧本]]\n[[Category:Scripts From Season One]]'}]}}}}
