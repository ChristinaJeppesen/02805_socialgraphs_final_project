Are we on a secure line?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Bush|Huh?

With the heightened security, it\'s only a matter of time before they find it!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Blonde Russian|Then we have no choice. We have to move up the attack.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Chris|I understand, comrade.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Blonde Russian|Prepare yourself. We detonate the bomb... within the hour.}}\n{{ScriptScene|12:17:56.

He must be somehow attacking remotely from his house. Did you find the address?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. I cross-referenced his MySpace page with realtor.com. His parents moved into that green house on Janice Street.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Jesus, that\'s on the other side of town. All right, Kyle, I\'m going to take a picture with my camera phone and upload it to you. You ready?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. \'\'[Cartman giggles and sticks the phone down his pants, in front of his genitals. He takes the picture and sends it to Kyle.

Do you think they could have hidden a nuclear device up Mrs. Clinton\'s...}}\n{{ScriptScene|CIA Headquarters. An agent comes up to Mr. Thompson with a report.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent|Mr. Thompson, the kid who called in the warning was right! We uncovered intel that terrorists \'\'have\'\' obtained a nuclear device, and that they have most likely hidden it in Mrs. Clinton\'s... well, in her...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|In her what?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Agent|In her snatch, sir.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|What?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|Back at the rally, later. Brian observes as two paramedics seat Hillary down on a gurney.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Hillary|What is goin\' on? I wasn\'t finished.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|Security measure, Mrs. Clinton. Probably nothing. \'\'[receives a call and answers it]\'\' Yes.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A CIA helicopter on its way to South Park, day.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|Mr. Jeffries, this is Alan Thompson with the CIA. We have reason to believe that Mrs. Clinton may have a nuclear device up her snatch.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|A what?!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|A snatch. It\'s the technical term for vagina.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|No, I mean what kind of nuclear device?!}}\n{{ScriptScene|A diagram of a bomb inside a woman\'s uterus.

Can we disable the timer?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|It won\'t have a timer. Snukes are detonated remotely. Whoever our terrorist is has a detonator with him.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|But then that means...}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|Yes. If we don\'t find that detonator, everyone in the town of South Park is going to die. For-ever.}}\n{{ScriptScene|12:28:38 and counting.

There\'s a suitcase nuke in Ms. Clinton\'s snizz.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|\'\'[stops]\'\' A snuke?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|That\'s right. It\'s controlled by a remote detonator.

I\'m almost there now; where are you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|We\'re on the town\'s main street, right by an ice cream shop.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|Oh dude, I\'m, I\'m right next to you. \'\'[the framing for the two scenes is removed to reveal the one image of Cartman standing next to the CIA agents.

And one of the links was to YouTube, where this Russian guy had a bunch of videos.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Russian?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah, this guy. \'\'[a YouTube profile page is shown]\'\' Vladimir Stolfsky. He had videos on YouTube of every single rally.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|So he\'s a Hillary Clinton fan.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|No. I cross-referenced his YouTube profile with MySpace, and according to his blog, he\'s an old-school Communist. So what\'s he doing at every Clinton rally?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Stan|Do a WebCrawler search: maybe he has podcasts up somewhere.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Oh that\'s a good idea. \'\'[does the search]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|The Hakeem house, later.

How long before the snuke in my snizz goes off?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Brian|They\'ll find the detonator, Hildog.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Aide 3|We can\'t wait for them to find the detonator.

Everyone stands in the street.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Mr. Thompson|\'\'[walking into view]\'\' Well, looks like we saved our country from British rule once again.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Kyle|Yeah. It just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people.
