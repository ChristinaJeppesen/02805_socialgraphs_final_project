And the owner is actually 10 par-cent Irish!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve|So, obviously, you\'re upset that you don\'t seem to have any customers.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|What I\'m upset about is a wee little thing called "cultural appropriation".

Why we can\'t dress like Indians on Halloween.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve|What\'s your point? }}\n{{ScriptDialog|Randy|I\'m looking at my point, you racist son of a bitch. You have no right to wear that stuff. It is offensive. Come on, guys! St. Patrick\'s Day is the one day of the year we have left where we can actually celebrate being white. Any other day that we tried to be proud of our culture, we would get immediately cancelled by Twitter! And yet for some reason, you\'re all over here, buying your weed from someone who is fine mocking our customs and traditions.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Steve|Maybe they\'re here because my St. Patrick\'s Day Special is better than yours. \'\'[Randy punches Steve and the two of them begin fighting]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptScene|Sometime later, two police cars are parked in front of Credigree Weed.

Maybe put on some green lipstick or something?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Public Defender|Before you touched the victim, did she give you any kind of consent?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Well, technically, yes! I mean, St. Patrick\'s Day is a wonderful day where we remember a British Roman man who went to Ireland and converted the whole country to Christianity! And he used a clover to represent the Holy Trinity, so we\'re supposed to celebrate that by wearing green and if you don\'t wear green you get a pinch!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Public Defender|And who is this St. Patrick to you?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|See?! That\'s the problem!

It was like this! \'\'[he pinches her hand, who slaps him in return]\'\' Ohhhg! \'\'[she slaps him again]\'\' Oh!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Public Defender|I am not representing this fucking animal! \'\'[she gets her things and leaves the room, then comes back and slaps Butters again]\'\'}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Butters|Ohhgu!}}\n{{ScriptScene|The work room.
