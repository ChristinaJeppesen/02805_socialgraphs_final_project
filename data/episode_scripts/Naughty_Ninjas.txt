The townspeople say the protest is meant to begin a dialog about the relationship between law enforcement and the citizens they are supposed to protect.}}\n{{ScriptScene|A montage begins to "Fuck the Police" playing in the background. The protest is shown, with everyone giving the middle finger to the cops. Even Fr. Maxi gives them the finger. Yates and his men look down from their second-story windows. Next, Whole Foods is shown. A shopper spots Officer Stevens and throws his cart right at him. Stevens turns around to see what hit him. The shopper feigns shock, then shrugs his shoulders and turns and walks away. Other shoppers laugh at his prank. Next is (vernacular), where a couple sits al fresco. They watch as Stevens sees his police car, now vandalized with "I\'M A DOUCHE". Next is Officer Barbrady at home with his aged dog. Next, Sgt. Yates reads the South Park times. Its lead headline: NO TO PIGS! YES TO FREE-RANGE PORK. Next, two officers drive down a street when they spot someone. It\'s Randy in his bathrobe, standing outside, He shows off his cock and balls as the officers roll by slowly. ShiTpaTown is shown. Barbrady drops into a fast-food restaurant to look for work. The staff there quickly kicks him out. Two homeless men approach SoDoSoPa only to flee when they see the ninja kids swarming the place. Barbrady returns to find an eviction notice taped to his door. Randy reaches Whole Foods for some shopping, but finds a homeless man in his way sleeping on the sidewalk. Then he looks at Whole Foods and sees the parking area filled with homeless people}}\n{{ScriptScene|Channel 4 News segment.}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Anchor|Are your children being lured into terrorist organizations?

I never said it was gay!}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Tolkien|Wait, he said this was gay?}}\n{{ScriptDialog|Cartman|That is a total lie!!

I went to Kyle\'s house to talk to him about it, and I found this. \'\'[pulls out a drawing of two ninjas, one of them having anal sex with the other one]\'\' It was then that Kyle confessed to me about how he had brainwashed Butters and Stan into thinking I had used a homophobic slur to refer to our organization.

Luckily I was the faster ninja. \'\'[reveals the, uh, guilty ninja, who\'s strapped into a chair and his ninja head covering is duck-taped over his face]\'\' Kyle knew I would never call ninjas gay.
