Each episode is approximately five minutes long. Each of her friends is a different [[species]] of animal. Peppa's friends are her age, and Peppa's younger brother George's friends are his age. Episodes tend to feature everyday activities such as attending [[pre-school playgroup|playgroup]], going swimming, visits with their [[grandparent]]s, [[cousin]]s, and friends, going to the [[playground]] or riding their [[bicycle|bikes]].\n\nThe characters wear clothes, live in houses, and drive cars, but still display some characteristics of the animals on which they are based. Peppa and her family snort like pigs during conversations in which they are speaking English, and the other animals make their respective noises when they talk, with some exhibiting other characteristics, such as the Rabbit family's squeaking sounds and enjoyment of carrots. The Rabbit and Mole families are the exceptions to the rule of human-like habitation, as they live in a [[burrow]] in a hill, though it has windows and is furnished in the same way as the other houses. The characters blush when embarrassed, and their mouths express other emotions such as sadness, happiness, irritation, bewilderment, and confusion. Although the main characters\u2014mostly mammals\u2014are anthropomorphic, other animal characters are not, such as Tiddles the tortoise, Polly Parrot, and the ducks. The narrator of the series, [[John Sparkes]], reinforces the action and humour, saying things like \"Oh, dear\" when something unfortunate happens (such as when George starts crying) or \"Look out!\" when a character is doing something unsafe (such as Peppa riding her bicycle without looking where she is going).\n\n==Production and airing==\nIn the United Kingdom, the first series of 52 five-minute episodes began on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] on 31 May 2004. The second series of 52 episodes began on Channel 5 on 4 September 2006, with Cecily Bloom replacing Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa, among other cast changes. The third series started telecasting on Channel 5's preschool-targeted block ''[[Milkshake!]]'' on 4 May 2009 with [[Harley Bird]] replacing Cecily Bloom and Lily Snowden-Fine as Peppa.\n\nIn the United States, the series first aired as part of [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Tickle-U]] preschool programming block from 22 August 2005 to 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/cartoon-network-launches-tickle-u-humor-preschoolers |title=Cartoon Network Launches Tickle U To Humor Preschoolers |publisher=Animation World Network |date=22 August 2005 |access-date=23 May 2017}}</ref> For these airings, the show was [[dubbing|redubbed]] with American actors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8412610/Peppa-Pig-a-history.html|title=Peppa Pig: a history|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=29 March 2011}}</ref> However, there were no other official releases of this dub, and every US airing since 2008 uses the original British soundtrack.<ref name=\"LicenseGlobal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.licenseglobal.com/archive/peppa-pig-track-us-success|title = Peppa Pig: On Track for U.S. Success|website=Licenseglobal.com|date = June 2011}}</ref> In 2008, ''Peppa Pig'' moved to the [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] channel in the US.
