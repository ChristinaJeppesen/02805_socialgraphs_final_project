Ideologically a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] and Cuban [[nationalist]], he also served as the [[Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|first secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] from 1961 until 2011. Under his administration, Cuba became a [[one-party]] [[communist state]]; industry and business were [[nationalized]], and [[state socialist]] reforms were implemented throughout society.\n\nBorn in [[Bir\u00e1n]], the son of a wealthy Spanish farmer, Castro adopted [[leftist]] and [[anti-imperialist]] ideas while studying law at the [[University of Havana]]. After participating in rebellions against right-wing governments in the [[Dominican Republic#Trujillo Era (1930\u201361)|Dominican Republic]] and [[La Violencia|Colombia]], he planned the overthrow of Cuban President [[Fulgencio Batista]], launching a failed attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] in 1953. After a year's imprisonment, Castro traveled to Mexico where he formed a revolutionary group, the [[26th of July Movement]], with his brother [[Ra\u00fal Castro]] and [[Che Guevara|Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara]]. Returning to Cuba, Castro took a key role in the [[Cuban Revolution]] by leading the Movement in a [[guerrilla war]] against Batista's forces from the [[Sierra Maestra]]. After Batista's overthrow in 1959, Castro assumed military and political power as Cuba's prime minister. The United States came to oppose Castro's government and unsuccessfully attempted to [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|remove him by assassination]], [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic embargo]], and counter-revolution, including the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961. Countering these threats, Castro aligned with the [[Soviet Union]] and allowed the Soviets to place nuclear weapons in Cuba, resulting in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]&nbsp;\u2013 a defining incident of the [[Cold War]]&nbsp;\u2013 in 1962.\n\nAdopting a Marxist\u2013Leninist model of development, Castro converted Cuba into a one-party, socialist state under Communist Party rule, the first in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Policies introducing central [[economic planning]] and expanding [[Healthcare in Cuba|healthcare]] and [[Education in Cuba|education]] were accompanied by state control of the press and the suppression of internal dissent. Abroad, Castro supported anti-imperialist revolutionary groups, backing the establishment of [[Marxist]] governments in [[Presidency of Salvador Allende|Chile]], [[Junta of National Reconstruction|Nicaragua]], and [[People's Revolutionary Government|Grenada]], as well as sending troops to aid allies in the [[Yom Kippur War|Yom Kippur]], [[Ogaden War|Ogaden]], and [[Angolan Civil War]]. These actions, coupled with Castro's leadership of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] from 1979 to 1983 and [[Cuba's medical internationalism]], increased Cuba's profile on the world stage. Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, Castro led Cuba through the economic downturn of the \"[[Special Period]]\", embracing environmentalist and [[anti-globalization]] ideas. In the 2000s, Castro forged alliances in the Latin American \"[[pink tide]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 namely with [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]'s Venezuela&nbsp;\u2013 and formed the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas]]. In 2006, Castro [[2006\u20132008 Cuban transfer of presidential duties|transferred his responsibilities]] to [[Vice President of Cuba|Vice President]] Ra\u00fal Castro, who was elected to the presidency by the [[National Assembly of People's Power|National Assembly]] in 2008.\n\nThe longest-serving non-royal head of state in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro polarized opinion throughout the world. His supporters view him as a champion of socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary government advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from [[U.S. hegemony]]. Critics call him a dictator whose administration oversaw [[Human rights in Cuba|human rights abuses]], [[Cuban exodus|the exodus of many Cubans]], and the impoverishment of the country's economy.\n\n==<span id='Biography'>Early life and career</span>==\n{{Main|Early life of Fidel Castro}}\n===Youth: 1926\u20131947===\nFidel Alejandro Castro Ruz was born [[out of wedlock]] at his father's farm on 13 August 1926.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourne|1986|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Coltman|2003|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> His father, [[\u00c1ngel Castro y Argiz]], a veteran of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]],<ref>\"[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_castro.html Fidel Castro (1926\u2013)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019214834/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/p_castro.html |date=19 October 2006 }}\".

Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports, and even these are produced by a pre-industrial process.

When Bishop was executed in a Soviet-backed coup by hard-line Marxist [[Bernard Coard]] in October 1983, Castro condemned the killing but cautiously retained support for Grenada's government.

Angolan President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. In response to the [[Battle of Cuito Cuanavale|siege of Cuito Cuanavale]] in 1987\u20131988 by South African-UNITA forces, Castro sent an additional 12,000 Cuban Army troops to Angola in late 1987.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|p=9}} From afar in Havana, Castro was closely involved in the decision-making about the defense of Cuito Cuanavle and came into conflict with Ochoa, whom he criticized for almost losing Cuito Cuanavle to a South African-UNITA assault on 13 January 1988 despite warning for almost two months prior that such an attack was coming.{{sfn|George|2004|p=220}} On 30 January 1988, Ochoa was summoned to a meeting with Castro in Havana where he was told that Cuito Cuanavale must not fall and to execute Castro's plans for a pull-back to more defensible positions over the objections of the Angolans.{{sfn|George|2004|p=221}} The Cuban troops played a decisive role in the relief of Cuito Cuanavale, breaking the siege in March 1988, which led to the withdrawal of most of the South African troops from Angola.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|p=9}} Cuban propaganda turned the siege of Cuito Cuanavle into a decisive victory that changed the course of African history and Castro awarded 82 soldiers medals of the newly created Medal of Merit for the Defense of Cuito Cuanavle on 1 April 1988.{{sfn|George|2004|pp=234\u2013235}} Tensions were increased with the Cubans advancing close to the border of Namibia, which led to warnings from the South African government that they considered this an extremely unfriendly act, causing South Africa to mobilize and call up its reserves.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|p=9}} In the spring of 1988, the intensity of South African-Cuban fighting drastically increased with both sides taking heavy losses.{{sfn|George|2004|pp=237\u2013239}}\n\nThe prospect of an all-out Cuban-South African war served to concentrate minds in both Moscow and Washington and led to an increased push for a diplomatic solution to the Angolan war.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|p=9}} The cost of Cuba's wars in Africa were paid for with Soviet subsidies at a time when the Soviet economy was badly hurt by low oil prices while the apartheid government of South Africa had by the 1980s become a very awkward American ally as much of the American population, especially black Americans, objected to apartheid. From the viewpoint of both Moscow and Washington, having both Cuba and South Africa disengage in Angola was the best possible outcome.{{sfn|Brogan|1989|p=9}} The low oil prices of the 1980s had also changed the Angolan attitude about subsidizing the Cuban economy as dos Santos found the promises made in the 1970s when oil prices were high to be a serious drain upon Angola's economy in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Vines\"/> South African whites were vastly outnumbered by South African blacks, and accordingly the South African Army could not take heavy losses with its white troops as that would fatally weaken the ability of the South African state to uphold apartheid.{{sfn|George|2004|p=234}} The Cubans had also taken heavy losses while the increasing difficult relations with dos Santos who become less generous in subsidizing the Cuban economy suggested that such losses were not worth the cost.{{sfn|George|2004|p=246}} Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola while South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia.

Castro would step down as head of government, to be replaced by the much younger [[Carlos Lage]], although Castro would remain the head of the Communist Party and commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Many older members of government were to be retired and replaced by their younger counterparts. A number of economic changes were proposed, and subsequently put to a national referendum. Free farmers' markets and small-scale private enterprises would be legalized in an attempt to stimulate economic growth, while U.S. dollars were also made legal tender. Certain restrictions on emigration were eased, allowing more discontented Cuban citizens to move to the United States. Further democratization was to be brought in by having the National Assembly's members elected directly by the people, rather than through municipal and provincial assemblies.

Influenced by Guevara, he suggested that Cuba could evade most stages of socialism and progress straight to communism.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=559\u2013560}} The Cuban Revolution nevertheless did not meet the Marxist assumption that socialism would be achieved through proletariat revolution, for most of the forces involved in Batista's overthrow were led by members of the Cuban middle-class.{{sfn|Balfour|1995|pp=177\u2013178}} According to Castro, a country could be regarded as socialist if its means of production were controlled by the state.

He described Castro as \"Nothing ordinary about him at all, he is unique, special, and different\".{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=60}} He profiled him as an [[egocentric]] who loved being the center of attention, and with his almost electric charisma, grabbing the attention of the people around him. He was also extremely manipulative; with his formidable intelligence, he was capable of manipulating a person or a group of people without much difficulty. In addition, he was repetitive and obsessive. In discussions with his colleagues or foreigners, he would repeat the same things over again on a continuous loop until they were convinced he was right. It was absolutely impossible to contradict him on any subject whatsoever. Anyone who attempted to convince him that he was wrong or even making a suggestion that it could be improved slightly was making a \"fatal error\". Fidel would then make a mental mark of the individual as an \"idiot\", and would wait for the right time to retaliate against them.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=5}} Nobody, not even Ra\u00fal was exempt from this; despite being the [[Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (Cuba)|minister of the armed forces]], he would bring seemingly minor military decisions to Castro for his final approval in order to avoid inadvertently contradicting him.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=192}} S\u00e1nchez believed that General [[Arnaldo Ochoa]]'s downfall was significantly related to his willingness to contradict Fidel's orders in Angola.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=57}}\n\nBiographer [[Leycester Coltman]] described Castro as \"fiercely hard-working, dedicated, loyal&nbsp;... generous and magnanimous\" but noted that he could be \"vindictive and unforgiving\". He asserted that Castro \"always had a keen sense of humor and could laugh at himself\" but could equally be \"a bad loser\" who would act with \"ferocious rage if he thought that he was being humiliated\".{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=14}} Publicly he was known for throwing tantrums, and could make \"snap judgements\" which he refused to back down from.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=494}} In private though, Castro was actually skilled at keeping his anger in check and not allowing it to affect his judgement, simply becoming cold and withdrawn; S\u00e1nchez stated that in 17 years he had only seen Castro explode in anger twice, one upon being informed of his daughter Alina's defection in 1993.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=72}}\n\nCastro was known for working long hours; he primarily woke up late \u2013 rarely before 10 or 11&nbsp;am \u2013 and started his working day around noon, and would work until late at night, often only going to bed at 3 or 4&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=219}} He preferred to meet foreign diplomats in these early hours, believing that they would be tired and he could gain the upper hand in negotiations.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=11}} Castro liked to meet with ordinary citizens, both in Cuba and abroad, but took a particularly paternal attitude toward Cubans, treating them as if \"they were a part of his own giant family\".{{sfn|Bourne |1986|p=273}} British historian [[Alex von Tunzelmann]] commented that \"though ruthless, [Castro] was a patriot, a man with a profound sense that it was his mission to save the Cuban people\".

His favorite film was the five-hour long 1967 adaption of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace (film series)|War and Peace]]''.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=48}} Castro had a lifelong passion, almost obsession, with cows and, starting in 1966, with bovine genetics and breeding. State media frequently published details of his attempts to breed cows with increased milk yields.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=44}} This interest reached its peak in 1982 when a cow that Fidel had bred, \"[[Ubre Blanca]]\", broke the Guinness World Record for producing 29 gallons of milk live on national television. She was promoted into a national celebrity and propaganda tool, and when the cow died in 1985, ''Granma'' published an official obituary for her on the front page, and the postal service issued stamps in her honor as well.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=44}}\n\n[[Fidel Castro's religious beliefs]] have been a matter of some debate; he was [[baptized]] and raised as a Roman Catholic. He criticized use of the Bible to justify the oppression of women and Africans,{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|pp=40\u201341}} but commented that Christianity exhibited \"a group of very humane precepts\" which gave the world \"ethical values\" and a \"sense of social justice\", relating, \"If people call me Christian, not from the standpoint of religion but from the standpoint of social vision, I declare that I am a Christian.\"{{sfn|Castro|Ramonet|2009|p=156}} During a visit of [[Jesse Jackson]], Castro accompanied him to a Methodist Church service where he even spoke from the pulpit with a Bible before him, an event that marked a beginning of increased openness towards Christianity in Cuba.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RuY08UQFRfwC&dq=%22fidel+castro%22+%22methodist+church%22+%22pulpit%22&pg=PA262 | title=The Cambridge Companion to Black Theology | isbn=9780521705691 | last1=Hopkins | first1=Dwight N. | last2=Antonio | first2=Edward P. | date=26 July 2012 }}</ref> He promoted the idea that [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] was a communist, citing the [[Feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5,000]] and the story of [[Jesus and the rich young man]] as evidence.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|p=695}}\n\n===Public image===\n[[File:Castro sign.jpg|thumb|Cuban propaganda poster proclaiming a quote from Castro: \"Luchar contra lo imposible y vencer\" (\"To fight against the impossible and win\")]] \nWithin Cuba, Castro was primarily referred to by his official military title ''Comandante El Jefe''; he was usually addressed as ''Comandante'' (The Commander) in general discourse as well as in person but could also be addressed as ''El Jefe'' (the Chief) in the third person, particularly within the party and military command.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=11}} Castro was often nicknamed \"''El Caballo''\" (\"The Horse\"), a label attributed to Cuban entertainer [[Benny Mor\u00e9]] which alludes to Castro's well known philandering during the 1950s and early 1960s.{{sfnm|1a1=Coltman|1y=2003|1p=219|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=175}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/26/havana-mourning-cubans-fidelista-fidel-castro|title=Havana in mourning: 'We Cubans are Fidelista even if we are not communist'|first1=Stephen|last1=Gibbs|first2=Jonathan|last2=Watts|first3=Ted|last3=Francis|date=26 November 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Bardach|first=Ann Louise|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/well-always-have-fidel-48159|title=We'll always have Fidel|magazine=Pacific Standard|date=15 October 2012|access-date=14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith his [[wikt:logorrheic|logorrheic]] oratorical abilities and profound charisma, Castro was extremely skilled at the art of manipulation and deception, easily whipping up his audience and even entire segments of the population into support for him. Large throngs of supporters gathered to cheer at Castro's fiery speeches, which typically lasted for hours (even outdoors in inclement weather) and without the use of written notes.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=312, 688}} During speeches, Castro regularly cited reports and books he had read on a wide variety of subjects, including military matters, plant cultivation, filmmaking, and chess strategies.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=352\u2013353}} Officially, the Cuban government did maintain a [[cult of personality]], but unlike other Soviet-era leaders and his allies, it was less widespread and took on a more subtle and discreet form.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=244}} There were no statues or large portraits of him but rather signs with \"thoughts\" of the ''Comandante''. Although his popularity among segments of the Cuban populace nevertheless led to one developing without the government's involvement and would be used to judge each individual's devotion to his \"revolutionary cause\" (judged by their contribution to the revolution).{{sfnm|1a1=Quirk|1y=1993|1p=255|2a1=Gott|2y=2004|2p=325}} Indeed, by 2006 Castro's image could frequently be found in Cuban stores, classrooms, taxicabs, and on national television.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4779529.stm |title=Ailing Castro still dominates Cuba |work=BBC News |date=11 August 2006 |access-date=13 January 2010}}</ref> In private, however, Castro hated such idolization campaigns and believed that he had intellectual ascendancy over leaders who engaged in such behavior, such as his friend [[Kim Il-sung]] of [[North Korea]] whose cult of personality he considered excessive, outlandish, and unreasonable.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=245}}\n\n[[File:Fidel Castro 2012.jpg|thumb|Castro in his characteristic green fatigues, 2012]]\nHe gave no importance to his appearance or clothing; for 37 years, he wore only his trademark olive-green military fatigues or the standard {{abbr|MINFAR|Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba}} dress uniform for formal events and special occasions, emphasizing his role as the perpetual revolutionary, but in the mid-1990s began wearing dark civilian suits and ''[[guayabera]]'' in public.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=303\u2013304}} At over {{convert|6|ft|3|inch}} tall with a few inches added from his combat boots, Castro usually towered over most foreign leaders he met with, giving him a dominating presence in any room or photo that was taken, which he used to his advantage (for comparison, [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Charles De Gaulle]], both well known for their tall heights, stood at 6'4 and 6'5 respectively). Until his uprising against Batista, Castro typically kept a pencil-thin moustache along with combed back hair, typical of Upper-class Cuban men in the 1950s but grew out both during his years as a guerilla fighter and retaining them afterwards. Castro also disliked worrying about his appearance and hated shaving, making the beard and uniform all the more convenient for him.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=56}} His uniform was also kept simple, he never wore any medals or decorations and his only marker of rank was the ''Comandante El Jefe'' insignia stitched on the shoulder straps. Until the 1990s, he wore combat boots, but due to orthopedic issues, abandoned them for sneakers and tennis shoes instead. Around his waist, he often carried a 9mm Browning pistol in a brown leather holster with an additional three clips.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=105}} His personal weapon of choice was a 7.62 Kalashnikov [[AKM]] which Castro occasionally carried with him during the 1960s but was later kept stored in a suitcase carried by one of the members of his escort or kept placed between his feet while driving along with five cartridges; he frequently used it during shooting exercises and practice.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=129}} Castro had a lifelong love of guns and was considered an expert sharpshooter, impressing foreign visitors and even holding up against members of his own elite bodyguards who engaged in frequent competition with him.{{sfn|Quirk|1993|pp=10, 255}}\n\nCastro's most iconic public feature eventually became the Cuban cigar that he smoked on a daily basis. Introduced to it by his father at the age of 15, Castro continued the habit for almost 44 years with the exception of a brief period during the 1950s while a guerilla fighter and boycotting against Batista linked tobacco firms.<ref name=\"cigaraficionado.com\">{{cite magazine|last=Shanken|first=Marvin R.|author-link=Marvin R.

S\u00e1nchez disputes this, saying that his doctor had Castro reduce his cigar usage starting in 1980 and quit entirely in 1983 after a cancerous ulcer was found in his intestine.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=274}} Prior to the Revolution, Castro smoked various brands including [[Romeo y Julieta (cigar)|Romeo y Julieta]] Churchill, [[H. Upmann]], Bauza, and [[Partag\u00e1s (cigar brand)|Partag\u00e1s]]. In the early 1960s, Castro saw one of his bodyguards smoking a noticeably aromatic but unbranded cigar. Castro and the bodyguard located the cigar maker, Eduardo Ribera, who agreed to establish the El Laguito Factory and branded the cigars as [[Cohiba (cigar brand)|Cohiba]] which became Castro's signature brand and elevating its profile internationally.<ref name=\"cigaraficionado.com\"/> Initially restricted for his own private use and other members of the Politburo, it was later presented as diplomatic gifts for allied countries and friends of Castro, most notably seen smoked by [[Che Guevara]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne]], [[Sukarno]], and [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=\"cigaraficionado.com\"/>\n\n===Lifestyle===\nCastro's primary residence was at ''Punto Cero'', a large and vegetative estate approximately 6&nbsp;km from the ''Palacio de la Revolution'' in the Siboney neighborhood.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=79}} The main house is a L-Shaped two-story family mansion with a 600-square-yard footprint, 50-foot-long swimming pool, six greenhouses providing fruit and vegetables for Fidel and Ra\u00fal's families as well as their bodyguard units, and a large lawn with free-range chickens and cows. Close by is a second two-story building used to house the bodyguards and the domestic staff.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=79}} The house itself was decorated in a classical Caribbean style, with local wicker and wood furniture, porcelain plates, watercolor paintings, and art books. S\u00e1nchez described the estate as naturally beautiful and tastefully decorated, and while considered luxurious for the average Cuban, was not lavish or over-the-top compared to the residences of the [[Somoza family|Somoza clan]] or the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]] of North Korea.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=80}} Ra\u00fal and [[Vilma Esp\u00edn|Vilma]]'s house ''La Rinconada'' is located close by on 222nd street. Ra\u00fal usually hosted large family barbecues on Sundays where Fidel would sometimes come, giving his extended family, sisters, and his elder brother Ram\u00f3n a rare opportunity to see him.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=195}} Next to ''Punto Cero'' is ''Unit 160'' which was the base of Fidel's bodyguard units. The base was over five acres large and surrounded by high walls, essentially a \"city within a city\" consisting of support personnel for transportation, communications, electronics, food, and an extensive armory of Kalashnikovs, Makarovs, and Browning's. Members of that unit also assisted in Fidel's passion for Bovine breeding and a stable was kept for some of Fidel's most prized cows.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=49}}\n\nIn addition to \"Punto Cero\", Castro had 5 other residences in Havana: ''Casa Cojimar'', his initial home after 1959 but disused by the 1970s; a house on 160th Street near the Playa district; ''Casa Carbonell'', maintained by Cuban Intelligence for his covert meetings with representatives of foreign groups or intelligence assets; A beach house in Santa Maria del Mar (next to the Tropico Hotel); and two houses retrofitted with air-raid shelters and connected to the MINFAR command bunkers for use in war: ''Casa Punta Brava'' (Dalia's old house before meeting Fidel) and ''Casa Gallego'', near the bodyguards base at Unit 160. In the west of Cuba, he had three residences: ''Casa Americana'' (confiscated from an American businessman connected to Batista); ''Rancho la Tranquilidad'' in the locality of Mil Cumbres; and La Deseada, a hunting lodge utilized in the winter for duck hunting and fishing trips. He also had two homes in Matanzas, one in Ciego de Avila, a horse ranch ''Hacienda San Cayetano'' in Camaguey along with another house in a vacation compound for the Politburo nearby, ''Casa Guardalavaca'' in Holguin, and two residences in Santiago de Cuba (One of which is shared with [[Ramiro Valdes]]).{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=268}}\n\nCastro's main vacation destination was Cayo de Piedra, a small key island formerly the site of a lighthouse, approximately a mile long and divided into two by a cyclone in the 1960s. He came upon the island by accident while reviewing the region in the aftermath of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. Instantly falling in love with the island, he ordered it closed off and had the lighthouse demolished.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=14}} [[Osmany Cienfuegos]] designed the a private bungalow, guesthouse, bridge, marina, and a building for the use of the bodyguards and support staff.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=15}} He arrived here from his inaccessible private marina located near the Bay of Pigs, ''La Caleta del Rosario'', which also housed another residence and guesthouse.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=10}} Castro utilized two yachts, ''Aquarama I'', confiscated from a Batista Government official and later in the 1970s, the 90-foot white hull ''Aquarama II''. ''Aquarama II'', which was decorated with wood donated from [[Angola]], had two double cabins, one for Fidel's personal use, a main sitting room, two bathrooms, a bar, a secure communications suite, and was equipped with four [[Osa-class missile boat]] engines gifted from Brezhnev allowing for top speeds of over 42 Knots.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=9}} ''Aquarama II'' had two companion speedboats utilized by his escort, ''Pioniera I'' and ''Pioniera II''; one was equipped with a large cache of weapons and another was equipped with medical equipment.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=7}}\n\nCastro also had a keen interest in [[gastronomy]] and was known to wander into his kitchen to discuss cookery with his chefs.{{sfn|Coltman|2003|p=224}} His diet was quintessentially Cuban, based on traditional pescatarian cuisine but also the additional influence from his native [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. All of his food was sourced from Punto Cero or fished from his private island of Cayo Piedra, with the exception of cases of [[Algerian wine|Algerian Red Wine]] gifted initially from [[Houari Boumediene]] and continued by successive Algerian governments and Iraqi figs and fruit jams from [[Saddam Hussein]].{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=84}} Castro, who typically woke up in the late morning, usually had tea or fish [[broth|bouillon]] for breakfast accompanied by milk provided from one of the cows that grazed on ''Punto Cero''; they were all bred to provide milk which suited Castro's demanding taste. His lunches were also frugal and consisted of fish or seafood soup with fresh produce. Dinner was his primary meal, consisting of grilled fish, chicken, mutton, or even ''pata negra'' ham on special occasions along with a large serving of green vegetables, but was prevented from eating beef or coffee by his dietician.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=83}}\n\nUntil 1979, Castro's primary vehicle was a black [[ZiL]] limousine, first an armored convertible [[ZIL-111]] from Khrushchev, a [[ZIL-114]] and briefly a [[ZIL-4104]] gifted to him by [[Leonid Brezhnev]], while his escort would accompany him in several [[Alfa Romeo 1750 Berlina|Alfa Romeo 1750s and 2000s]].{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=104}} In 1979, during the Non-Aligned movement summit at Havana, Saddam Hussein gave Castro his Armored [[Mercedes-Benz W126|Mercedes-Benz 560 SEL]] which he had brought from Baghdad and became his sole transport for the rest of his life. Subsequently, Fidel ordered two mechanics from his bodyguard unit to West Germany to purchase several second-hand Mercedes-Benz 500's to replace the obsolete Alfa Romeos.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=104}} Castro always travelled with at least fourteen guards and four of his aides, spread out over four vehicles; three Mercedes-Benz's and one Soviet Lada which trailed the main convoy (to keep the military presence at a minimal). Whenever he would leave Havana, a fifth Mercedes would join the procession carrying his doctor, nurse, and photographer.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=100}}\n\n===Relationships===\n[[File:Barbudos - Fidel Castro and Camilo Cienfuegos.jpg|thumb|Castro and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] before playing a baseball game]]\nIn his personal life, Castro was known for being distant, withdrawn, and confided in very few people. His closest and most trusted friend was [[Ra\u00fal Castro]], his younger brother by five years and longtime armed forces minister.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=41}} Although Ra\u00fal has a vastly contrasting, almost polar opposite personality to Castro, S\u00e1nchez describes Ra\u00fal as complementing Castro's personality in all the ways that he is not. Whereas Fidel was \"charismatic, energetic, visionary but extremely impulsive and totally disorganized\", Ra\u00fal was described as a \"natural, methodical, and uncompromising organizer\". Castro spoke nearly every day with Ra\u00fal, met several times a week, and was a frequent visitor at Ra\u00fal and Vilma's house; Vilma was also considered close to Castro and often appeared in public with him at national events.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=188}} Besides Ra\u00fal, Castro was not close to any of his other siblings, although he did have friendly relations with his elder brother Ram\u00f3n and sister Angelita.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=187}} His sister [[Juanita Castro]] has been living in the United States since the early 1960s, and is a public opponent of the Cuban regime.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871241-1,00.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930065044/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871241-1,00.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=30 September 2007| title=The Bitter Family (page 1 of 2)|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=10 July 1964| access-date=19 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nOutside of his immediate family, Castro's closest friend was fellow revolutionary [[Celia S\u00e1nchez]], who accompanied him almost everywhere during the 1960s, and controlled almost all access to the leader.{{sfn|Bourne|1986|pp=200\u2013201}}{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=41}} Reynaldo S\u00e1nchez confirmed that Celia was indeed Castro's mistress and regarded her as the \"true love of his life\".{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=41}} Castro provided a large apartment for Celia on 11th Street near Vedado, ''El Once'' whom Fidel visited every day before returning home. Over the years, Castro added an elevator, fitness room, and a bowling alley for his and Celia's personal use. He even provided bodyguards from his own escort to Celia for her own protection.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=42}}\n\nCastro's closest male friends were the members of his immediate bodyguard unit, ''Escolta'' or the \"Escort\".{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=92}} His security was provided by Department 1 of the Personal Security Directorate of [[Ministry of the Interior (Cuba)|MININT]] (Ministry of the Interior). Department 1 was for Fidel's security, Department 2 was Ra\u00fal and Vilma's, and Department 3 was for the members of the Politburo and so on.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=40}} Unlike the other MININT Departments, both his and Ra\u00fal's units bypassed the normal chain of command and reported to them directly. Castro's security consisted of three concentric ''anillos'' or rings. The third ring consisted of thousands of soldiers both in MININT and MINFAR who provided support for Logistics, Air-Defense, Intelligence, etc.; The second ring consisted of eighty to one hundred soldiers who provided the outer perimeter security; And the first ring, the Elite ''Escolta'' or \"The Escort\", which provided his immediate security and consisted of two teams of 15 elite soldiers who worked 24-hour shifts, along with around 10 support staff.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=40}}\n\nA soldier at heart, Castro had more affinity with his escort than his civilian family. He spent most of his time under their protection and were usually his companions in his personal interests.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=92}} A sports fan, he also spent much of his time trying to keep fit, undertaking regular exercise such as hunting, fly fishing, underwater fishing, scuba diving, and playing basketball.{{sfn|S\u00e1nchez|2015|p=93}} They were also his companions on special events, such as his birthday or during national holidays, which they would regularly exchange gifts and engage in one-sided discussions with Castro where he would recall his life stories.
