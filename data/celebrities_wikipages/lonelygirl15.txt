It was independently released on [[YouTube]] from June 16, 2006 to August 1, 2008, and was also briefly released on [[Revver]] and [[Myspace]]. The series revolves around the initially mundane life of homeschooled 16-year-old Bree Avery ([[Jessica Lee Rose]]), who uses the username Lonelygirl15 online. She goes on the run with her friend Daniel ([[Yousef Abu-Taleb]]) after her parents' mysterious religion is revealed to be The Order, a blood-harvesting operation that wants her \"trait positive\" blood. The series is presented through video blogs, or [[vlog]]s, originally recorded solely from Bree's bedroom.\n\nAfter discovering [[YouTube]] in 2005, Beckett, then a doctor, came up with the idea for a series of staged video blogs presented as though they were real, and set out to create ''Lonelygirl15'' with Flinders, a filmmaker. The two wrote a script and came up with the character of Bree together. Greg and Amanda Goodfried, both lawyers, were brought on to handle the business aspect of the project and to manage Bree's online affairs, respectively. Bree's first few vlogs were posted to the Lonelygirl15 YouTube channel in June 2006, and they quickly gained popularity on the website, eventually making Lonelygirl15 [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels#Historical progression of most-subscribed channels|the most-subscribed YouTube channel]]. \n\nAs the series gained popularity, viewers began to question its authenticity, and users of the Lonelygirl15.com forum soon found proof that it was fake after messaging Bree on Myspace and tracing her IP address to the offices of [[Creative Artists Agency]], where Amanda Goodfried worked. A story published by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' revealing this information, as well as a post on journalist Tom Foremski's blog ''Silicon Valley Watcher'' revealing Rose's identity, led to the project being outed as a hoax in September 2006. Viewership for the series continued to grow after the reveal, and it experienced its highest viewership in 2007.\n\nBree has frequently been called YouTube's first viral star, and ''Lonelygirl15'' became known for calling into question the authenticity of web content and for pioneering [[vlog]]ging. Over the course of its release, ''Lonelygirl15'' won a [[Webby Award]] and a [[VH1 Big in '06 Awards|VH1 Big in '06 Award]], and was nominated for a [[YouTube Awards|YouTube Award]]. [[EQAL]], a production company founded by Beckett and Flinders, produced several spinoffs of the series, including ''[[KateModern]]'' and ''[[LG15: The Resistance]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|1=section|date=May 2022}}\n\n===Season one===\nBree Avery (Lonelygirl15), a homeschooled 16-year-old girl, begins posting video blogs on YouTube about her mundane daily life and her interests, such as science and her purple monkey puppet, P-Monkey. Her best friend, Daniel (Danielbeast), occasionally appears in the videos and uploads videos of his own, and a romantic connection between Daniel and Bree starts to form as tensions regarding Bree's family's strange, unnamed religion arise between Bree and Daniel, and later between Bree and her parents. Bree is soon chosen to participate in a mysterious ceremony for her religion, which she must prepare for by dieting, take shots, and learning [[Enochian]]. After an argument between Bree and Daniel, Daniel starts following her outside and recording her while she prepares for the ceremony with her \"helper\", Lucy. Daniel discovers that Lucy has photographs of him on her computer and staged a fake ceremony with Bree to trick him while he was recording, and Bree asks her parents to tell the deacons of her religion that she no longer wants to go through with the ceremony, to which they agree.\n\nLater, the show moved to a bizarre narrative that portrayed her dealings with secret occult practices within her family, and included the mysterious disappearance of her parents after she refused to attend a \"secret\" ceremony prescribed by the leaders of the family's cult.{{Citation needed|date=June 2021}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Jessica Lee Rose]] as Bree Avery (a.k.a. lonelygirl15), a bubbly teenage girl whose trait positive blood makes her the target of a dangerous cult called the Order. She gained a large following on YouTube due to her quirky video blogs.\n*[[Yousef Abu-Taleb]] as Daniel Barlow (a.k.a. Danielbeast), Bree's best friend, who only wishes to protect her, but is often distracted by romantic engagements. He can often jump to conclusions, and battles with an alcohol addiction along with his parents.\n*[[Jackson Davis (actor)|Jackson Davis]] as Jonas Wharton (a.k.a. jonastko), a boy who meets Bree online and discovers that his family has more ties to the Order than he realizes. He can be too willing to trust others, which often leads the TAAG (Teen Angst Adventure Group) into unfortunate situations.\n*[[Alexandra Dreyfus]] as Sarah Genatiempo (a.k.a. theskyisempty99), a misunderstood 19-year-old who develops a crush on Daniel and travels with TAAG. While she struggles to figure out what to do with her life, she harbors a dark and dangerous secret.\n*Becki Kregoski as Taylor Genatiempo (a.k.a. soccerstar4ever), Sarah's younger sister who has impressive computer hacking skills. A passionate soccer player, she has more social skills than the rest of her family and is often upset by their actions.\n*Maxwell Glick as Spencer Gilman (a.k.a. LAlabrat), an employee at [[Neutrogena]] with connections to the Order's science division. Chosen as a good role model for Bree, he sets out to help engineer a Trait Negative Serum.\n*Katherine Pawlak as Emma Wharton, Jonas's trait positive younger sister. She grows up significantly during her battle for her life against the Order, and goes out of her way to try to protect her friends.\n*[[Melanie Merkosky]] as Jennie, a former Lullaby Project employee who becomes friends with Sarah. She begins a romantic affair with Jonas and gives the TAAG an insight on how the Order's structure works.\n*Crystal Young as Gina Hart, Bree's trait positive older sister who was taken from her at birth and used as a lab rat most of her life. She is quiet and reserved, and feels more comfortable with art supplies than with other people.\n*Raegan Payne as Sonja, A member of the Hymn of One who tried to recruit Bree and eventually left the Hymn after she was badly beaten. One of the last videos in the Lonelygirl15 series suggested that Sonja had returned to the Hymn of One.\n\n==Production==\n===Conception and casting===\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n| align = left\n| total_width = 300\n| image1 = Jessica Lee Rose - Streamy Awards 2009 (5).jpg\n| image2 = Yousef 2017 cropped.jpg\n| footer = [[Jessica Lee Rose]] and [[Yousef Abu-Taleb]] were picked to play Bree Avery and Daniel, respectively.\n}}\n\nAfter quitting a plastic surgery program, Miles Beckett, who was producing video podcasts in [[Los Angeles]], discovered [[YouTube]] in 2005 after seeing [[The Lonely Island]]'s video for their song \"[[Lazy Sunday (The Lonely Island song)|Lazy Sunday]]\" on [[Myspace]]. At the time, YouTube was still mostly unknown.<ref name=\"rnz\">{{cite web |last1=Falconer |first1=Ellen |title=An oral history of lonelygirl15 |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/the-wireless/374034/an-oral-history-of-lonelygirl15 |website=[[Radio New Zealand|RNZ]] |access-date=May 13, 2022 |language=en-nz |date=June 16, 2016}}</ref> He got the idea for a fictional narrative story told through a series of ostensibly authentic video blogs, or [[vlog]]s, after watching videos of YouTube duo [[Smosh]] lip-syncing to the [[Pok\u00e9mon Theme|''Pok\u00e9mon'' theme song]] and realizing it was difficult to tell the difference between what was real and what was staged on the site.<ref name=\"guardianretro\" /> \n\nBeckett met Ramesh \"Mesh\" Flinders, a screenwriter and filmmaker from [[Marin County, California]],<ref name=\"nyt1\">{{cite web |last1=Heffernan |first1=Virginia |last2=Zeller |first2=Tom Jr. |title=The Lonelygirl That Really Wasn't |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/technology/13lonely.html?_r=0 |website=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=May 12, 2022 |language=en |date=September 13, 2006}}</ref> during a birthday party at The Gaslite, a karaoke bar in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], in April 2006.<ref name=\"vocativ\">{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Jennings |title=Lonelygirl15, An Oral History 10 Years Later |url=https://www.vocativ.com/327378/lonelygirl15-oral-history/ |website=[[Vocativ]] |access-date=May 22, 2022 |date=June 14, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"sfgate\" /> The two quickly became close and wrote a script, as well as a storyline for the first three months of vlogs, in two weeks. Together, they came up with the character of Bree, a quirky, homeschooled 16-year-old \"[[girl next door]]\" belonging to a strange religion who would post daily vlogs, occasionally with her best friend, Daniel, until one day she disappeared. When she disappeared, the two would make an independent [[direct-to-video]] film styled after ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' and based on the vlogs in which Bree's fans go looking for her. The idea for the film was eventually scrapped after the series gained traction on YouTube. Bree's character was partially inspired by Flinders's own sheltered upbringing on a commune in [[Northern California]], as well as his knowledge of the occult.<ref name=\"rnz\" /><ref name=\"guardianretro\" /> Flinders would later leave the series in 2007 to work on other projects.<ref name=\"sfgate\" />\n\nGreg Goodfried, a lawyer and friend of Flinders and Beckett, was brought on to manage the business aspect of the series, while Amanda Solomon, Goodfried's wife and an attorney for [[Creative Artists Agency]], was brought on to act as Bree online, which included managing her Myspace account and replying to emails sent in by fans.<ref name=\"abcnews\" /> Grant Steinfeld, a software engineer from San Francisco, was also brought on to help distribute the videos and create a dummy website for the series, though he soon dropped out of the project.<ref name=\"nyt1\" /> Before they found someone to portray Bree in the videos, Beckett and Flinders posted two video replies to popular YouTubers at the time on a channel titled Lonelygirl15.<ref name=\"guardianretro\" /> Using space and resources provided by the nonprofit organization Film Independent, Flinders, Beckett, and Goodfried held a casting call in Los Angeles, which they posted on [[Craigslist]] as ''The Children of Anchor Cove''.<ref name=\"vocativ\" /><ref name=\"azds\" /> After graduating from the [[New York Film Academy]], then-19-year-old actress [[Jessica Lee Rose]] moved to Los Angeles to start her acting career. After finding the Craiglist listing, she auditioned for the role in April 2006. The three cast Rose for the role due to her youthful appearance and relative anonymity at the time, as she had only been to one other audition before that.<ref name=\"vocativ\" /> Despite some initial hesitancy after finding out it would be on the Internet, worried that it was either a scam or a pornographic film, Rose agreed to take on the role.<ref name=\"abcnews\" /> She later said of playing Bree, \"I loved that character. It's one of my favourites that I've ever gotten to play.\"<ref name=\"guardianretro\" /> \n\n[[Yousef Abu-Taleb]], who had moved from [[Virginia]] to Los Angeles the year before his audition and was working as a server at [[Red Lobster]], was cast as Daniel because of his \"dorky\", \"unpretentious\" look.<ref name=\"vocativ\" /> Both Rose and Abu-Taleb were asked to delete or make private all of their online accounts by the show's creators before filming began.<ref name=\"guardianretro\" /> The cast and crew of the series were all required to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s.<ref name=\"nyt1\" /> In order to maintain Rose and Abu-Taleb's anonymity, both were given enough money by the show's creators to avoid having to work in public, and they stayed in their houses for three months until the series was exposed as a hoax.<ref name=\"rnz\" />\n\nIn early January 2007, ''[[American Idol]]'' runner-up [[Katharine McPhee]], whose [[Katharine McPhee (album)|debut album]] was being released later that month, guest starred in an episode of the series (\"Truth or Dare\") after her management team reached out to the show's creators. The episode featured a song from the album.<ref name=\"katmcphee\" />\n\n===Filming, writing, editing, and release===\nRose's first vlog as Bree, \"First Blog/Dorkiness Prevails\", was posted to the Lonelygirl15 YouTube channel on June 16, 2006. It was one minute and 35 seconds long, unscripted, and produced with a budget of $130.<ref name=\"nbc2.0\" /> The video used a broken desk lamp and natural light from a window for lighting, and was filmed using a [[Logitech]] [[QuickCam]] in Flinders's bedroom, which was decorated with furniture from thrift stores and [[Target Corporation|Target]], including a pink feather boa and a floral blanket, to give it the appearance of a teenage girl's bedroom.
