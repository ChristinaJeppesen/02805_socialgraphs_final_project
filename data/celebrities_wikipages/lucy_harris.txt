She questioned Smith personally about the plates and demanded to see them. He told her, \"he was not permitted to exhibit them to any one except those whom the Lord should appoint to testify of them.\" This did not resolve her concern and she persisted in demanding to see the plates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lds.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times-student-manual/chapter-four-a-period-of-preparation-1823-29?lang=eng|work=Church History In The Fulness Of Times Student Manual|title=Chapter Four: A Period Of Preparation, 1823\u201329|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|date=2003|access-date=June 27, 2022|archivedate=September 10, 2022|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910211521/http://lds.org/manual/church-history-in-the-fulness-of-times-student-manual/chapter-four-a-period-of-preparation-1823-29?lang=eng}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Martin and Lucy Harris Home.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Martin and Lucy Harris home in Palmyra Township, Wayne County, New York]]\nIn order to convince Lucy that they were translating an ancient book of scripture, Martin Harris asked Smith to instead let him borrow the [[Lost 116 pages|first 116 pages]] of the translation of the Book of Mormon. Smith said that these pages of the translation of the Book of Mormon were a translation from the [[Book of Lehi]]. At Harris's insistence (and despite Smith saying he was warned not to by the Lord), Smith reluctantly loaned the pages to Harris. The manuscript was subsequently lost, and a variety of theories as to its disappearance have arisen.

She answered in the affirmative, notwithstanding she went home in a great rage, determined to have satisfaction for the treatment which she had received.
