He is known for his roles as [[Little Joe (character)|Little Joe Cartwright]] in ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1959\u20131973), [[Charles Ingalls]] in ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (1974\u20131983), and Jonathan Smith in ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'' (1984\u20131989).

His father was Jewish,<ref name=heritage/> and his mother was Roman Catholic. Eugene was the Orowitz family's second child; their daughter, Evelyn, was born three years earlier, in 1933. In 1941, when Landon was four years old, he and his family moved to the [[Borough (New Jersey)|borough]] of [[Collingswood, New Jersey]]. He attended, and celebrated his [[bar mitzvah]] at [[Temple Beth Sholom (Cherry Hill, New Jersey)|Temple Beth Sholom]]. His family recalls that Landon \"went through a lot of hassle studying for the big event, which included bicycling to a nearby town every day in order to learn how to read [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and recite prayers.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Cheryl|last= Landon Wilson|title=I Promised My Dad: An Intimate Portrait of Michael Landon by His Eldest Daughter| publisher= Simon & Schuster| location= New York| year= 1992|page=28}}</ref>\n\nDuring his childhood, Landon was constantly worrying about his mother attempting [[suicide]]. On a family beach vacation, his mother tried to drown herself, but he rescued her. Shortly after the attempt, his mother acted as if nothing happened, and a few minutes later, he vomited.

Other parts came: movie roles in ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]'' (1957), ''[[Maracaibo (film)|Maracaibo]]'' (1958), ''[[High School Confidential (film)|High School Confidential]]'' (1958), the notorious ''[[God's Little Acre (film)|God's Little Acre]]'' (1958), and ''[[The Legend of Tom Dooley]]'' (1959), as well as many roles on television, such as ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'' (three episodes), ''[[The Restless Gun]]'' (pilot episode aired on ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]''), ''Sheriff of Cochise'' (in \"Human Bomb\"), ''U.S. Marshal'' (as Don Sayers in \"The Champ\"), ''Crusader'', ''[[Frontier Doctor]]'', ''[[The Rifleman]]'' (in \"End of a Young Gun\", 1958), ''[[The Adventures of Jim Bowie]]'', ''[[Johnny Staccato]]'', ''[[Wire Service]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', ''[[The Court of Last Resort]]'', ''[[State Trooper (TV series)|State Trooper]]'' (two episodes), ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' (three episodes), ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'' (in the 1958 episode \"The Hemp Tree\"), ''[[The Tall Man (TV series)|The Tall Man]]'', ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'' (in the episodes \"The Man From Brewster\", with [[John Carradine]]<ref>Season 2, episode 7</ref> and \"Rose of the Rio Bravo\", with [[Kathleen Nolan]]), ''[[Trackdown (TV series)|Trackdown]]'' (two 1958 episodes), and ''[[Wanted Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]'', starring [[Steve McQueen]] (in episodes \"The Martin Poster\", 1958, and \"The Legend\", 1959). Landon also appeared in at least 2 episodes of ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]'' including \"Gift from a Gunman\" in 1957 and \"Living is a Lonely Thing\" in 1959.\n\nLandon can be seen in two uncredited speaking roles as a cavalry trooper in a 1956 episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Warner Bros.]] television series ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'', an episode titled \"Decision.\" Two years later, Landon returned to that same series as White Hawk in \"The White Warrior\".\n\n===''Bonanza''===\n[[File:Michael Landon in Bonanza episode Showdown (2).jpg|thumb|Landon in ''[[Bonanza]]'' (1960)]]\nIn 1959, at the age of 22, Landon began his first starring TV role as Little Joe Cartwright on ''[[Bonanza]]'', one of the first TV series to be broadcast in color. Also starring on the show were [[Lorne Greene]], [[Pernell Roberts]], and [[Dan Blocker]]. During ''Bonanza''{{'}}s sixth season (1964\u20131965), the show topped the [[Nielsen ratings]] and remained number one for three years.\n\nReceiving more fan mail than any other cast member,<ref>\"Bonanza\" liner notes, Bear Family CD Collection</ref> Landon negotiated with executive producer [[David Dortort]] and NBC to write and direct some episodes. In 1962, Landon wrote his first script. In 1968, Landon directed his first episode. In 1993, ''[[TV Guide]]'' listed Little Joe's September 1972 two-hour wedding episode (\"Forever\") as one of TV's most memorable specials. Landon's script recalled Little Joe's brother, Hoss, who was initially the story's groom, before [[Dan Blocker]]'s death. During the final season, the ratings declined, and NBC canceled ''Bonanza'' in November 1972. The last episode aired on January 16, 1973.\n\nAlong with [[Lorne Greene]] and [[Victor Sen Yung]], Landon appeared in all 14 seasons of the series. Landon was loyal to many of his ''Bonanza'' associates including producer [[Kent McCray]], director [[William F. Claxton]], and composer [[David Rose (musician)|David Rose]], who remained with him throughout ''Bonanza'' as well as ''Little House on the Prairie'' and ''Highway to Heaven''.\n\n===''Little House on the Prairie''===\n[[File:Michael Landon Pa Ingalls Little House on the Prairie 1974.jpg|thumb|Landon as Charles Ingalls, 1974]]\nThe year after ''Bonanza'' was canceled, Landon went on to star as Charles Ingalls in the pilot of what became another successful television series, ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', again for NBC. The show was taken from [[Little House on the Prairie|a 1935 book]] written by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], whose character in the show was played by nine-year-old actress [[Melissa Gilbert]]. In addition to Gilbert, two other unknown actresses also starred on the show: [[Melissa Sue Anderson]], who appeared as Mary Ingalls, the oldest daughter in the Ingalls family, and [[Karen Grassle]] as Charles' wife, Caroline. Landon served as executive producer, writer, and director of ''Little House.''\n\nThe show was nominated for several Emmy and Golden Globe awards. After eight seasons, ''Little House'' was retooled by NBC in 1982 as ''[[Little House: A New Beginning]]'', which focused on the Wilder family and the Walnut Grove community. Though Landon remained the show's executive producer, director and writer, ''A New Beginning'' did not feature Charles and Caroline Ingalls. ''A New Beginning'' was actually the final chapter of ''Little House,'' as the series ended in 1983. The following year, three made-for-television movies aired.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nMelissa Gilbert said of her on- and off-screen chemistry with Landon, \"He was very much like a 'second father' to me. [[Paul Gilbert (actor)|My own father]] passed away when I was 11, so, without really officially announcing it, Michael really stepped in.\" When not working on the ''Little House'' set, Gilbert spent most of the weekends visiting Landon's real-life family. She once said, \"The house was huge. We ran like banshees through that house, and Mike would hide behind doorways and jump out and scare us.\"{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In a 2015 interview, Gilbert said of Landon, \"He gave me so much advice...the overall idea that he pounded into me, from a little girl, into my brain was that nothing's more important than 'Home & Family'; no success, no career, no achievements, no accomplishments, nothing's more important than loving the people you love and contributing to a community. Though we were working, really, really hard, we were 'Not Saving The World', one episode of television at a time, we're just entertaining people and there are more important things to do... and have fun; no matter what.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/tammyjones-gibbs/2015/04/24/actress-melissa-gilbert-and-actordirector-timothy-busfield-nbcs-night-shift|title=Actress Melissa Gilbert and Actor/Director Timothy Busfield (NBC's Night Shift)|website=BlogTalkRadio.com|date=April 24, 2015 |access-date=March 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Highway to Heaven''===\nAfter producing both \"Little House\" and later the ''[[Father Murphy]]'' TV series, Landon starred in another successful program. In ''[[Highway to Heaven]]'', he played a probationary [[angel]] (who named himself Jonathan Smith) whose job was to help people in order to earn his wings. His co-star on the show was [[Victor French]] (who had previously co-starred on Landon's ''Little House on the Prairie'') as ex-cop Mark Gordon. On ''Highway'', Landon served as executive producer, writer, and director. ''Highway to Heaven'' was the only show throughout his long career in television that he owned outright.\n\nBy 1985, prior to hiring his son, [[Michael Landon Jr.]], as a member of his camera crew, he also brought real-life cancer patients and disabled people to the set. His decision to work with [[disabled]] people led him to hire a couple of adults with disabilities to write episodes for ''Highway to Heaven''.\n\nBy season four, ''Highway'' dropped out of the Nielsen top 30, and in June 1988, NBC announced that the series would return for an abbreviated fifth season, which would be its last. Its final episodes were filmed in the fall of 1988. One aired in September, two in December, one in March 1989, and the remainder aired on Fridays from June to August. French did not live to see ''Highway''{{'s}} series finale broadcast; he died of advanced lung cancer on June 15, 1989, two months after it was diagnosed. Landon invited his youngest daughter, [[Jennifer Landon]], to take part in the final episode.\n\n===Other projects===\n[[File:Michael Landon 1990.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Landon at the 42nd Emmy Awards Governor's Ball, September 1990]]\nIn 1972, he was among the guests in [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]]' musical [[television special]] ''[[The Special London Bridge Special]]'', starring [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and [[Jennifer O'Neill]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=May 6, 1972|title=Lake Havasu city plays a starring role in special|page=12-D|work=Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, Landon was an episode director and writer for the short-lived [[NBC]] romantic anthology series ''[[Love Story (1973 TV series)|Love Story]]''. In 1982, he co-produced an NBC \"true story\" television movie, ''[[Love Is Forever (1982 film)|Love Is Forever]]'',<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0085870|title=Love Is Forever}}</ref> starring himself and [[Laura Gemser]] (who was credited as Moira Chen), about Australian photojournalist [[John Everingham]]'s successful attempt to [[scuba diving|scuba dive]] under the [[Mekong]] to rescue his lover from communist-ruled [[Laos]] in 1977. The real Everingham was cast as an extra in the film.\n\n''[[Sam's Son]]'' was a 1984 coming-of-age feature film written and directed by Landon and loosely based on his early life. The film stars [[Timothy Patrick Murphy]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Anne Jackson]], [[Hallie Todd]], and [[James Karen]]. Karen previously worked for Landon in the made-for-television film ''Little House: The Last Farewell''.\n\nHe was a guest of the PBS television series ''[[The Electric Company]]''.\n\nAfter the cancellation of ''Highway to Heaven'' and before his move to CBS, Landon wrote and directed the teleplay ''[[Where Pigeons Go to Die]]''. Based on a novel of the same name, the film starred [[Art Carney]] and was nominated for two Emmy awards.\n\nUp through the run of ''Highway to Heaven'', all of Landon's television programs were broadcast on NBC, a relationship of which lasted thirty consecutive years with the network.

[[Melissa Gilbert]], who played his daughter on ''Little House'' said that the actor made her feel \"incredibly safe\" and that he was \"paternal\". Often cited on the special was Landon's bizarre sense of humor, which included having toads leap from his mouth and dressing as a superhero to visit a pizza parlor.\n\nIn 1991, during Landon's final ''Tonight Show'' appearance, Johnny Carson related how the actor took him back to a restaurant the two had dined at previously.

[[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] starred in the title role as Michael Landon, with [[Cheryl Ladd]] as Lynn Noe and [[Joel Berti]] as Michael Landon Jr. The biopic detailed, from Michael Jr's point of view, the personal emotional trauma he endured during his parents' divorce and his father's premature death. The movie spanned a timeline from the 1960s through the early 1990s.\n\nA plaque and small playground referred to as the \"Little Treehouse on the Prairie\" was erected in Knight Park, a central park in Landon's hometown of Collingswood. In 2011, the plaque was removed from the park by the borough and was later given to a local newspaper by an unnamed person. According to the Collingswood, NJ website, the plaque was removed during a fall cleanup with plans to return it to a safer location. The plaque was reinstated next to a bench in a safer location the following summer.<ref>{{cite web|first= Kevin |last= Riordan |url= http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/kevin_riordan/20120104_Kevin_Riordan__Landon_plaque_sidelined__accounts_vary.html |title=Kevin Riordan: Landon plaque sidelined; accounts vary |publisher=Philly.com |date=January 4, 2012 |access-date=August 2, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collingswood.com/node/8182 |title=Michael Landon plaque and commemorative playground pickets reinstalled at Knight Park &#124; Collingswood, New Jersey |publisher=Collingswood.com |access-date=February 3, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018022747/http://www.collingswood.com/node/8182 |archive-date=October 18, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2021, Karen Grassle, Landon's co-star on ''Little House'', published her memoir, ''Bright Lights, Prairie Dust: Reflections on Life, Loss, and Love by House's Ma''. <ref name=Ma>{{cite web |last1=Grassle |first1=Karen |title=Bright Lights, Prairie Dust: Reflections on Life, Loss, and Love by House's Ma |url=https://shewritespress.com/product/bright-lights-prairie-dust/ |website=shewritespress.com |access-date=11 September 2022}}</ref> In the book, Grassle detailed the  troubled relationship she had with Landon, citing derogatory remarks he made about her while on the set of ''Little House'', often with other members of the cast and crew present.<ref name=Fox>{{cite web |last1=Nolasco |first1=Stephanie |title='Little House on the Prairie' star Karen Grassle: 8 surprising revelations from her tell-all book |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/little-house-on-the-prairie-star-karen-grassle-memoir-revelations |website=[[Fox News]] |date=December 8, 2021 |access-date=11 September 2022}}</ref>  Grassle subsequently \"mended fences\" with Landon prior to his death in 1991 from pancreatic cancer.<ref name=Fox/><ref>{{cite web |last1=VanHoose |first1=Benjamin |title=Karen Grassle 'Grateful' She 'Mended Fences' with 'Little House' Costar Michael Landon Before His Death |url=https://people.com/tv/karen-grassle-michael-landon-disputes-set-little-house-on-prairie/ |website=people.com |access-date=11 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | Film\n|-\n!
