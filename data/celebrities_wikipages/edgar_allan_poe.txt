Poe is best known for his poetry and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the [[macabre]]. He is widely regarded as a central figure of [[Romanticism]] in the United States, and of [[American literature]]. Poe was one of the country's earliest practitioners of the [[short story]], and considered to be the inventor of the [[detective fiction]] genre, as well as a significant contributor to the emerging genre of [[science fiction]].{{sfn|Stableford|2003|pp=18\u201319}} Poe is the first well-known American writer to earn a living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult life and career.<ref name = Meyers138/>\n\nPoe was born in [[Boston]], the second child of actors [[David Poe Jr.|David]] and [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth \"Eliza\" Poe]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edgar Allan Poe's Richmond : the Raven in the River City|last=Semtner|first=Christopher P.|date=2012|publisher=History Press|isbn=978-1-60949-607-4|location=Charleston [SC]|page=15|oclc=779472206}}</ref> His father abandoned the family in 1810, and when his mother died the following year, Poe was taken in by John and Frances Allan of [[Richmond, Virginia]]. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well into young adulthood. He attended the [[University of Virginia]] but left after a year due to lack of money. He quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education, and his gambling debts. In 1827, having enlisted in the [[United States Army]] under an assumed name, he published his first collection ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', credited only to \"a Bostonian\". Poe and Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the death of Allan's wife in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet at [[West Point]], declared a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and parted ways with Allan.\n\nPoe switched his focus to prose and spent the next several years working for [[literary journal]]s and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. In 1836, he married his 13-year-old cousin, [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]], but she died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1847. In January 1845, Poe published his poem \"[[The Raven]]\" to instant success. He planned for years to produce his own journal ''The Penn'' (later renamed ''[[The Stylus]]''), but before it could be produced, [[Death of Edgar Allan Poe|he died in Baltimore]] on October 7, 1849, at age 40, under mysterious circumstances. The cause of his death remains unknown, and has been variously attributed to many causes including disease, alcoholism, substance abuse, and suicide.<ref name=\"Meyers256\"/>\n\nPoe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as specialized fields such as [[cosmology]] and [[cryptography]]. He and his work appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums. The [[Mystery Writers of America]] present an annual award known as the [[Edgar Award]] for distinguished work in the mystery genre.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Edgar Allan Poe Birthplace Boston.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Boston]] marking the approximate location of Poe's birth]]\nEdgar Poe was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on January 19, 1809, the second child of American actor [[David Poe Jr.]] and [[England|English]]-born actress [[Eliza Poe|Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins Poe]].

Poe was then taken into the home of John Allan, a successful merchant in [[Richmond, Virginia]], who dealt in a variety of goods, including cloth, wheat, tombstones, tobacco, and slaves.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=8}} The Allans served as a foster family and gave him the name \"Edgar Allan Poe\",<ref name=Meyers9>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=9}}</ref> although they never formally adopted him.{{sfn|Quinn|1998|p=61}}\n\nThe Allan family had Poe baptized into the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in 1812. John Allan alternately spoiled and aggressively disciplined his foster son.<ref name=Meyers9/> The family sailed to the United Kingdom in 1815, and Poe attended the grammar school for a short period in [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine, Ayrshire]], Scotland (where Allan was born) before rejoining the family in London in 1816. There he studied at a boarding school in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] until summer 1817. He was subsequently entered at the Reverend John Bransby's Manor House School at [[Stoke Newington]], then a suburb {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} north of London.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|pp=16\u201318}}\n\nPoe moved with the Allans back to Richmond in 1820. In 1824, he served as the lieutenant of the Richmond youth honor guard as the city celebrated the [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States|visit of the Marquis de Lafayette]].{{sfn|PoeMuseum.org|2006}} In March 1825, Allan's uncle and business benefactor William Galt died, who was said to be one of the wealthiest men in Richmond,{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=20}} leaving Allan several acres of real estate. The inheritance was estimated at $750,000 ({{Inflation|US|750000|1825|fmt=eq|r=-6}}).{{Inflation/fn|US}} By summer 1825, Allan celebrated his expansive wealth by purchasing a two-story brick house called Moldavia.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nPoe may have become engaged to [[Sarah Elmira Royster]] before he registered at the [[University of Virginia]] in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|pp=29\u201330}}<ref>University of Virginia. ''A Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the University of Virginia. Second Session, Commencing February 1st, 1826''. Charlottesville, VA: Chronicle Steam Book Printing House, 1880, p. 10</ref> The university was in its infancy, established on the ideals of its founder [[Thomas Jefferson]]. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were mostly ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students to choose their own studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|pp=21\u201322}} During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. He claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|pp=32\u201334}} Poe gave up on the university after a year but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married another man, Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer,<ref name=Meyers32>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=32}}</ref> and he started using the [[pseudonym]] Henri Le Rennet during this period.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|p=41}}\n\n==Military career==\n[[File:FtIndependence2.jpg|thumb|left|Poe was first stationed at Boston's [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] while in the Army.]]\nPoe was unable to support himself, so he enlisted in the [[United States Army]] as a private on May 27, 1827, using the name \"Edgar A. Perry\". He claimed that he was {{nowrap|22 years old}} even though he was 18.{{sfn|Cornelius|2002|p=13}} He first served at [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Fort Independence]] in [[Boston Harbor]] for five dollars a month.<ref name=Meyers32/> That same year, he released his first book, a 40-page collection of poetry titled ''[[Tamerlane and Other Poems]]'', attributed with the byline \"by a Bostonian\". Only 50 copies were printed, and the book received virtually no attention.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|pp=33\u201334}} Poe's regiment was posted to [[Fort Moultrie]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and traveled by ship on the brig ''Waltham'' on November 8, 1827. Poe was promoted to \"artificer\", an enlisted tradesman who prepared shells for artillery, and had his monthly pay doubled.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=35}} He served for two years and attained the rank of Sergeant Major for Artillery (the highest rank that a non-commissioned officer could achieve); he then sought to end his five-year enlistment early. Poe revealed his real name and his circumstances to his commanding officer, Lieutenant Howard, who would only allow Poe to be [[military discharge|discharged]] if he reconciled with Allan. Poe wrote a letter to Allan, who was unsympathetic and spent several months ignoring Poe's pleas; Allan may not have written to Poe even to make him aware of his foster mother's illness. Frances Allan died on February 28, 1829, and Poe visited the day after her burial. Perhaps softened by his wife's death, Allan agreed to support Poe's attempt to be discharged in order to receive an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]].{{sfn|Silverman|1991|pp=43\u201347}}\n\nPoe was finally discharged on April 15, 1829, after securing a replacement to finish his enlisted term for him.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=38}} Before entering West Point, he moved back to Baltimore for a time to stay with his widowed aunt Maria Clemm, her daughter [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Eliza Clemm]] (Poe's first cousin), his brother Henry, and his invalid grandmother Elizabeth Cairnes Poe.{{sfn|Cornelius|2002|pp=13\u201314}} In September of that year, Poe received \"the very first words of encouragement I ever remember to have heard\"{{sfn|Sears|1978|p=114|ps=, quoting a letter from Poe to Neal.}} in a review of his poetry by influential critic [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]], prompting Poe to dedicate one of the poems to Neal{{sfn|Lease|1972|p=130}} in his second book ''Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems'', published in Baltimore in 1829.{{sfn|Sova|2001|p=5}}\n\nPoe traveled to West Point and matriculated as a cadet on July 1, 1830.{{sfn|Krutch|1926|p=32}} In October 1830, Allan married his second wife Louisa Patterson.{{sfn|Cornelius|2002|p=14}} The marriage and bitter quarrels with Poe over the children born to Allan out of extramarital affairs led to the foster father finally disowning Poe.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|pp=54\u201355}} Poe decided to leave West Point by purposely getting [[court-martial]]ed. On February 8, 1831, he was tried for gross neglect of duty and disobedience of orders for refusing to attend formations, classes, or church. He tactically pleaded not guilty to induce dismissal, knowing that he would be found guilty.{{sfn|Hecker|2005|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nPoe left for New York in February 1831 and released a third volume of poems, simply titled ''Poems.'' The book was financed with help from his fellow cadets at West Point, many of whom donated 75 cents to the cause, raising a total of $170. They may have been expecting verses similar to the satirical ones that Poe had been writing about commanding officers.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|pp=50\u201351}} It was printed by Elam Bliss of New York, labeled as \"Second Edition,\" and including a page saying, \"To the U.S. Corps of Cadets this volume is respectfully dedicated\". The book once again reprinted the long poems \"Tamerlane\" and \"Al Aaraaf\" but also six previously unpublished poems, including early versions of \"[[To Helen]]\", \"[[Poems by Edgar Allan Poe#Israfel (1831)|Israfel]]\", and \"[[The City in the Sea]]\".{{sfn|Hecker|2005|pp=53\u201354}} Poe returned to Baltimore to his aunt, brother, and cousin in March 1831. His elder brother Henry had been in ill health, in part due to problems with alcoholism, and he died on August 1, 1831.{{sfn|Quinn|1998|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\n==Publishing career==\nAfter his brother's death, Poe began more earnest attempts to start his career as a writer, but he chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so.{{sfn|Whalen|2001|p=64}} He was one of the first Americans to live by writing alone<ref name=Meyers138>{{harvnb|Meyers|1992|p=138}}</ref><ref name=Quinn305>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=305}}</ref> and was hampered by the lack of an international [[copyright law]].{{sfn|Silverman|1991|p=247}} American publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans.<ref name=Quinn305/> The industry was also particularly hurt by the [[Panic of 1837]].{{sfn|Whalen|2001|p=74}} There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|p=99}} Publishers often refused to pay their writers or paid them much later than they promised,{{sfn|Whalen|2001|p=82}} and Poe repeatedly resorted to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=139}}\n\n[[File:VirginiaPoe.jpg|thumb|upright|Poe (age 26) obtained a license in 1835 to marry his cousin [[Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe|Virginia Clemm]] (age 13). They were married for 11 years until her death, which may have inspired some of his writing.]]\nAfter his early attempts at poetry, Poe had turned his attention to prose, likely based on John Neal's critiques in ''[[The Yankee]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Lease|1972|p=132}} He placed a few stories with a [[Philadelphia]] publication and began work on his only drama ''[[Politian (play)|Politian]]''. The ''[[Baltimore Saturday Visiter]]'' awarded him a prize in October 1833 for his short story \"[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]\".{{sfn|Sova|2001|p=162}} The story brought him to the attention of [[John P. Kennedy]], a Baltimorean of considerable means who helped Poe place some of his stories and introduced him to Thomas W. White, editor of the ''[[Southern Literary Messenger]]'' in Richmond. Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835,{{sfn|Sova|2001|p=225}} but White discharged him within a few weeks for being drunk on the job.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=73}} Poe returned to Baltimore where he obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time.<ref name=\"Silverman 1991 124\">{{harvnb|Silverman|1991|p=124}}</ref> He was 26 and she was 13.\n\nPoe was reinstated by White after promising good behavior, and he went back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the ''Messenger'' until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500.<ref name=Allen/> He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and stories in the paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia held a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] wedding ceremony performed by [[Amasa Converse]] at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.<ref name=\"Silverman 1991 124\"/>{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=85}}\n\nPoe's novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'' was published and widely reviewed in 1838.{{sfn|Silverman|1991|p=137}} In the summer of 1839, Poe became assistant editor of ''[[Burton's Gentleman's Magazine]]''. He published numerous articles, stories, and reviews, enhancing his reputation as a trenchant critic which he had established at the ''Messenger''. Also in 1839, the collection ''[[Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque]]'' was published in two volumes, though he made little money from it and it received mixed reviews.{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=113}}\n\nIn June 1840, Poe published a [[prospectus (book)|prospectus]] announcing his intentions to start his own journal called ''[[The Stylus]]'',{{sfn|Meyers|1992|p=119}} although he originally intended to call it ''The Penn'', as it would have been based in Philadelphia.

One of the most notable of these was [[Lizzie Doten]], who published ''Poems from the Inner Life'' in 1863, in which she claimed to have \"received\" new compositions by Poe's spirit.
