While on the show, Walker's character used the [[catchphrase]] \"Dyn-O-Mite!\" which he also used in his mid\u20131970s TV commercial for a [[Panasonic]] line of [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and [[8-track tape]] players and a 2021 and 2022 Medicare commercial. He also starred in ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' with John Amos, and ''The Greatest Thing That Almost Happened'' with [[James Earl Jones]].

Through a New York State funded program known as ''SEEK'' (Search for Education, Evaluation, and Knowledge), he continued his studies and entered into the field of radio engineering with [[WLTW|WRVR]]. As a young man, Walker was a vendor at [[Yankee Stadium]], starting with the [[1964 World Series]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1967, Walker began working full-time with WRVR, the radio station of the [[Riverside Church]]. In 1969, Walker began performing as a [[stand-up comedian]] and was eventually discovered by the casting director for ''[[Good Times]]'', after making appearances on ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh In]]'' and on the ''[[Jack Paar|Jack Paar Show]]''. He eventually released one stand-up comedy album during the height of his ''Good Times'' popularity: ''Dyn-o-mite'' on Buddah Records (5635). During ''Good Times''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[1974\u201375 United States network television schedule|1974\u201375 season]], Walker was 26 years old, though his character was much younger. [[John Amos]], the actor who portrayed Walker's father on ''Good Times'', was actually just eight years older than Walker.\n\nWalker credits producer/director [[John Rich (director)|John Rich]] for inventing \"Dyn-o-mite!\" which Rich insisted Walker say on every episode. Both Walker and executive producer [[Norman Lear]] were skeptical of the idea, but the phrase and Walker's character caught on with the audience.<ref name=CNN />\n\nOff- and on-camera, Walker did not get along with the series' lead, [[Esther Rolle]], because she and Amos disapproved of Walker's increasingly buffoonish character and his popularity, and Walker felt hurt by their disdain. Dissatisfaction led Amos (before Rolle), to leave the show, making Walker the star of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sitcomsonline.com/boards/archive/index.php/t-53025.html|title=Was Jimmie Walker getting along with Esther Rolle and John Amos on the set?
