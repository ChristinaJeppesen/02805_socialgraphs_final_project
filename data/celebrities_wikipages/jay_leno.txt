Kimmel discussed his appearance on Leno's show during an interview with [[Marc Maron]] for the latter's [[WTF with Marc Maron|podcast]] in 2012.  Kimmel stated that he felt O'Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno.  According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC.  During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made.  (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel's time slot and become his lead-in.)  However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, \"those conversations were gone,\" according to Kimmel.  Realizing that Leno's relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt \"worked over,\" reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.<ref>[http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_249_-_jimmy_kimmel  \"Episode 249&nbsp;\u2013 Jimmy Kimmel\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130936/http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_249_-_jimmy_kimmel |date=December 27, 2016 }}.
