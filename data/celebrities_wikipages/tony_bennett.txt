He fought in the final stages of World War II as a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[infantry]]man in the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theater]]. Afterward, he developed his singing technique, signed with [[Columbia Records]] and had his first number-one popular song with \"[[Because of You (1940 song)|Because of You]]\" in 1951. Several tracks such as \"[[Rags to Riches (song)|Rags to Riches]]\" followed in early 1953. He then refined his approach to encompass [[jazz singing]]. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as ''[[The Beat of My Heart]]'' and ''[[Basie Swings, Bennett Sings]]''. In 1962, Bennett recorded his [[signature song]], \"[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]\". His career and personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era. Bennett staged a comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] albums again and expanding his reach to the [[MTV generation]] while keeping his musical style intact.\n\nBennett continued to create popular and critically praised work into the 21st century. He attracted acclaim for his collaborations with [[Lady Gaga]], which began with the album ''[[Cheek to Cheek (album)|Cheek to Cheek]]'' (2014); the two performers [[Cheek to Cheek Tour|toured]] together to promote the album throughout 2014 and 2015. With the release of the duo's second album, ''[[Love for Sale (Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga album)|Love for Sale]]'' (2021), Bennett broke the individual record for the longest span of top-10 albums on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for any living artist; his first top-10 record was ''[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco (album)|I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]'' in 1962. Bennett also broke the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the oldest person to release an album of new material, at the age of 95 years and 60 days.\n\nBennett has amassed numerous accolades throughout his career, including 20 [[Grammy Award]]s (including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] presented in 2001) and two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. He was named an [[NEA Jazz Masters|NEA Jazz Master]] and a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honoree]].
