All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record's sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues.<ref name=\"Master P\" /> Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal. Additionally, Master P invented many innovative marketing techniques. According to Wendy Day, CEO of the Rap Coalition, \"Master P had a whole marketing movement. He was the first person to market the way a corporate entity like IBM would market to their clientele.\" Whereas the traditional model for marketing records was to spend millions of dollars on expensive videos and air play, Miller did not have such a luxury. As an independent artist, Miller had to find a way to sell, market and build platinum record selling demand on a limited recording budget. He was known for keeping upfront business expenses down and [[profit margin]]s high. He began selling tapes out the trunk of his car in every city and town in America where there was potential demand for his music. He gave out free samples to people with expensive cars and had them playing his music throughout their neighborhoods. This street level [[guerrilla marketing]] technique set the foundation to build a larger fanbase for the future. After signing his deal with Priority, Miller began a high volume business model of cranking out as many records as possible, as frequently as possible. He branded all his albums, so that the No Limit brand became more important than the actual artist's name. Miller cross-promoted all his artists and albums inside the album covers. He also used [[Pen & Pixel|pen and pixel graphics]] and [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]]-inspired themes to make his albums stand out using Photoshop. He offered 20 songs per album, whereas most albums offered 15 or less, as Miller learned that customers wanted more for their money. He turned his artists into [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[comic book]]-like characters rather than just rappers. He made sure his artists were number one on [[Nielsen SoundScan|SoundScan]] every time they released an album, to build the perception of popularity. He used inexpensive videos to promote his artists and he cross-promoted albums using films and vice versa and tied them altogether as a package. Brand image and identity became more important than just music quality. Miller's record labels have sold 75 million records as a result of his innovative marketing and branding strategies.<ref name=\"NEIL STRAUSS\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/master-p-597332 | title=Master P \u2013 Biography | publisher=Biography.com | access-date=July 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs founder and CEO of No Limit Entertainment, Miller at one time presided over a business empire that included his conglomerate No Limit Enterprises, [[No Limit Records]], Bout It Inc., No Limit Clothing, No Limit Communications, No Limit Films, No Limit Sports Management, P.
