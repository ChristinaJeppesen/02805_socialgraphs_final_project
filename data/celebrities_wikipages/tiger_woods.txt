There's an unplayable lie |newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |last=Lyon |first=Bill |date=August 16, 2000 }}</ref> At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\n\nA related effect was measured by [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003\u201304. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \"superstar\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.<ref>Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417030936/http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf |date=April 17, 2012 }}, Job Market Paper, November 2007</ref>\n\nMany courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, in a strategy that became known as \"Tiger-proofing\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harig |first1=Bob |title='Tiger-proofing' Augusta took a toll on all |date=March 27, 2011 |url=https://www.espn.com/golf/masters11/columns/story?columnist=harig_bob&page=110329-RTTMasters |work=ESPN |access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.<ref name=\"Open2005\">{{cite news|title=Tiger Woods Press Conference:The Open Championship |publisher=TigerWoods.com |agency=ASAP Sports |date=July 12, 2005 |url=http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&iNewsID=199184&categoryID=&pagenumber=1&cat=0 |access-date=May 13, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316104728/http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&iNewsID=199184&categoryID=&pagenumber=1&cat=0 |archive-date=March 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Career achievements==\n{{Main|List of career achievements by Tiger Woods}}\n\nWoods has won 82 official [[PGA Tour]] events, including 15 [[Men's major golf championships|majors]].
