A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as the 47th [[vice president of the United States|vice president]] from 2009 to 2017 under President [[Barack Obama]], and represented [[Delaware]] in the [[United States Senate]] from 1973 to 2009.<!--Please do NOT change first paragraph without prior consensus on the talk page. Thank you.-->\n\nBiden was born and raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and moved with his family to [[New Castle County, Delaware|Delaware]] in 1953 when he was ten years old. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before earning his law degree from [[Syracuse University]]. He was elected to the [[New Castle County Council]] in 1970 and became the [[List of youngest members of the United States Congress#List of youngest U.S. senators|sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history]] after he was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected to the United States Senate from Delaware in 1972]], at age 29. Biden was the chair or [[ranking member]] of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] for 12 years. He also chaired the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] from 1987 to 1995; led the effort to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]]; and oversaw six [[U.S. Supreme Court]] confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|for Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]].\n\nBiden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]], before becoming Obama's vice president after they won the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. During his two terms as vice president, Biden frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and was a close counselor to President Obama. \n\nBiden and his running mate, [[Kamala Harris]], defeated incumbent [[Donald Trump]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]]. Upon inauguration, he became the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|oldest president in U.S. history]] and the first to have a female vice president. Biden signed the [[American Rescue Plan Act]] to help the U.S. recover from the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]] and [[COVID-19 recession#United States|subsequent recession]]. He proposed the [[American Jobs Plan]], aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan [[Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]]. He proposed the [[American Families Plan]], which was merged with other aspects of the American Jobs Plan into the proposed [[Build Back Better Act]]. After facing opposition in the Senate, the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and it was comprehensively reworked into the [[Inflation Reduction Act of 2022]], covering deficit reduction, [[climate change]], healthcare, and tax reform. Biden [[Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination|appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson]] to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, he restored the U.S. into the [[Paris Agreement]] on climate change. He completed the [[Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)|withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan]], during which the [[2021 Taliban offensive|Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control]]. He responded to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] by imposing [[International sanctions during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|sanctions on Russia]] and authorizing [[List of foreign aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War|foreign aid and weapons shipments]] to Ukraine.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life (1942\u20131965)==\n{{Main|Early life and career of Joe Biden}}\n[[File:Joe Biden at Archmere Academy (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Biden at Archmere Academy in the 1950s]]\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,<ref name=\"cong-bio\">{{CongBio |id=b000444 |name=Joseph R.
