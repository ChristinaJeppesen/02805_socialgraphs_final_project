He was the co-founder, chairman, and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]; the chairman and majority shareholder of [[Pixar]]; a member of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of [[NeXT]]. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the [[personal computer revolution]] of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder [[Steve Wozniak]].<!-- The lack of citations is purposeful because this is a summary of what is cited in the body. See Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#Citations. -->\n\nJobs was born in San Francisco to a [[Syrian]] father and [[German-American]] mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended [[Reed College]] in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India [[Hippie trail|seeking enlightenment]] before later studying [[Buddhism in the West#Emerging mainstream western Buddhism|Zen Buddhism]]. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's [[Apple I]] personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the [[Apple II]], one of the first highly successful mass-produced [[microcomputer]]s. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the [[Xerox Alto]] in 1979, which was [[computer mouse|mouse]]-driven and had a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful [[Apple Lisa]] in 1983, followed by the breakthrough [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the [[desktop publishing]] industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple [[LaserWriter]], the first [[Laser printing|laser printer]] to feature [[vector graphics]].\n\nIn 1985, Jobs was forced out of Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, [[John Sculley]]. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a [[computer platform]] development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the [[visual effects]] industry when he funded the computer graphics division of [[George Lucas]]'s [[Lucasfilm]] in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] feature film ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995) and went on to become a major [[animation studio]], producing [[List of Pixar films|over 25 films]] since.\n\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with English designer [[Jony Ive]] to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"[[Think different]]\" advertising campaign and leading to the [[Apple Store]], [[App Store (iOS)]], [[iMac]], [[iPad]], [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[iTunes]], and [[iTunes Store]]. In 2001, the original [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] was replaced with the completely new Mac OS X (now known as [[macOS]]), based on NeXT's [[NeXTSTEP]] platform, giving the operating system a modern [[Unix]]-based foundation for the first time. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a [[pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor]]. He died of [[respiratory arrest]] related to the tumor on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].\n\n== Background ==\n===Family===\nSteven Paul Jobs was born in [[San Francisco, California]], on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali ({{Lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u062f\u0644\u064a}}).<ref name=\"never met\"/> His cousin, [[Bassma Al Jandaly]], maintains that his birth name was Abdul Lateef Jandali.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gulfnews.com/technology/steve-jobs-a-tribute-to-the-cousin-i-never-met-1.887022|title=Steve Jobs: A tribute to the cousin I never met|website=gulfnews.com|access-date=May 30, 2021|archive-date=June 2, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602213354/https://gulfnews.com/technology/steve-jobs-a-tribute-to-the-cousin-i-never-met-1.887022|url-status=live}}</ref> He was adopted by Clara (n\u00e9e Hagopian) and Paul Reinhold Jobs.<ref name=\"never met\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8811345/Steve-Jobs-adopted-child-who-never-met-his-biological-father.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/8811345/Steve-Jobs-adopted-child-who-never-met-his-biological-father.html |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Steve Jobs: adopted child who never met his biological father |date=October 6, 2011 |work=Daily Telegraph |access-date=September 18, 2018 |issn=0307-1235}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nAbdulfattah \"John\" Jandali was born and raised in an [[Arab Muslim]] household in [[Homs]], Syria.

Later, after I'd met my father, I tried to believe he'd changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary, plotting a new world for the Arab people. Even as a feminist, my whole life I'd been waiting for a man to love, who could love me. For decades, I'd thought that man would be my father.

I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida.<ref name=sg/>}}\n\nA few years later, Schieble married an ice skating teacher, George Simpson. Mona Jandali took her stepfather's last name, as Mona Simpson. In 1970, after divorcing her second husband, Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her alone.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|p=253}}\n\nWhen Simpson found that their father, Abdulfattah Jandali, was living in [[Sacramento, California]], Jobs had no interest in meeting him as he believed Jandali didn't treat his children well{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|p=256}} and allegedly because of finding a ''Seattle Times'' article about Jandali's abandonment of his students on a trip to Egypt in 1974.<ref name=\"graff\"/> Simpson went to Sacramento alone and met Jandali, who worked in a small restaurant. They spoke for several hours, and he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. He said he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that \"we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone.\" He said he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and that \"all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper.\" At the request of Jobs, Simpson did not tell Jandali that she had met his son.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|p=257}}\n\nAfter hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that \"it was amazing ... I had been to that restaurant a few times, and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands.\" However, Jobs still did not want to meet Jandali because \"I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ... I asked Mona not to tell him about me.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|p=257}} Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked \"what is this thing about Steve Jobs?\" Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, \"My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ... He never contacted Steve.\" Because Simpson herself researched her Syrian roots and began to meet the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in her 1992 novel ''[[The Lost Father]]''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2015|p=258}} [[Malek Jandali]] is their cousin.<ref>[https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2012/07/malek-jandali-mona-simpson-james-gelvin Conversations: Malek Jandali, Mona Simpson, & James Gelvin] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414174937/https://hammer.ucla.edu/programs-events/2012/07/malek-jandali-mona-simpson-james-gelvin/ |date=April 14, 2018 }} (UCLA Hammer Museum event).

He has been a key figure in public discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful. Through his career, the media investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires. His name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all large global philanthropy.<ref name=\"record thin\"/> Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations.<ref name=\"mystery\"/>\n\nMark Vermilion, former charitable leader for [[Joan Baez]], Apple, and Jobs, attributed Jobs's lifelong minimization of direct charity to his perfectionism and limited time. Jobs, Vermilion, and supporters said over the years that corporate products were Jobs's superior contributions to culture and society instead of direct charity.<ref name=\"record thin\">{{Cite news |last=Whoriskey |first=Peter |date=October 6, 2011 |title=Record thin on Steve Jobs' philanthropy |url=https://washingtonpost.com/business/economy/record-thin-on-steve-jobss-philanthropy/2011/10/06/gIQA3YKKRL_story.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=August 6, 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref> In 1985, Jobs said, \"You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it\u2019s humorous, all the attention to it, because it\u2019s hardly the most insightful or valuable thing that\u2019s happened to me.\"<ref name=\"mystery\"/>\n\nShortly after leaving Apple, he formed the charitable Steven P. Jobs Foundation, led by Mark Vermilion, hired away from Apple's community leadership. Jobs wanted a focus on nutrition and vegetarianism but Vermilion wanted social entrepreneurship. That year, Jobs soon launched NeXT and closed the foundation with no results. Upon his 1997 return to Apple, Jobs optimized the failing company to the core, such as eliminating all philanthropic programs, never to be restored. In 2007, ''Stanford Social Innovation Review'' magazine listed Apple among \"America\u2019s least philanthropic companies\". A few months after another unflattering news report, Apple started a program to match employees' charitable gifts.<ref name=\"record thin\"/> Jobs has declined to sign [[The Giving Pledge]], launched in 2010 by [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Bill Gates]] for fellow billionaires.<ref name=\"record thin\"/><ref name=\"mystery\"/> He donated $50 million to Stanford hospital and contributed to efforts to cure AIDS.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nath |first=Trevir I. |date=October 6, 2021 |title=How Steve Jobs changed the world |url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/012815/how-steve-jobs-changed-world.asp |website=www.investopedia.com |access-date=March 22, 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref> [[Bono]] reported \"tens of millions of dollars\" given by Apple while Jobs was CEO, to AIDS and HIV relief programs in Africa, which inspired other companies to join.<ref name=\"record thin\"/>\n\n==Honors and awards==\n[[File:Steve Jobs (1).JPG|thumb|Statue of Jobs at Graphisoft Park, [[Budapest]]<ref name=\"GlobalPost\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/weird-wide-web/steve-jobs-apple-iphone-statue-budapest-hungary-graphisoft |title=Steve Jobs statue unveiled in Hungary science park |date=December 21, 2011 |work=GlobalPost |access-date=December 28, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110222451/http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/weird-wide-web/steve-jobs-apple-iphone-statue-budapest-hungary-graphisoft |archive-date=January 10, 2012 }}</ref>]]\n* '''1985:''' [[National Medal of Technology]] (with [[Steve Wozniak]]), awarded by US President [[Ronald Reagan]]<ref name=\"NMTR\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.uspto.gov/nmti/recipients_85.html |title=The National Medal of Technology Recipients 1985 Laureates |publisher=Uspto.gov |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826141353/http://www.uspto.gov/nmti/recipients_85.html |archive-date=August 26, 2009 |access-date=April 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n* '''1987:''' [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Award for Public Service]]<ref name=\"jeffersonawards\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national |title=National Winners &#124; public service awards |publisher=Jefferson Awards.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220022823/http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national |archive-date=February 20, 2012 |access-date=April 19, 2010 }}</ref>\n* '''1989:''' ''Entrepreneur of the Decade'' by ''[[Inc.
