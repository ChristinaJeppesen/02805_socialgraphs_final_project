Each contains a [[genealogy of Jesus]] showing ancestry from King [[David]], but through different sons; Matthew follows the major royal line from [[Solomon]], while Luke traces another line back to [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], another son of David and Bathsheba. Consequently, all the names between David and Joseph are different.\n\nLike the two differing genealogies, the infancy narratives appear only in Matthew and Luke and take different approaches to reconciling the requirement that the Messiah be born in Bethlehem with the tradition that Jesus in fact came from [[Nazareth]]. In Matthew, Joseph obeys the direction of an angel to marry Mary. Following the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, Joseph is told by an angel in a dream to [[Flight into Egypt|take the family to Egypt]] to escape the [[Massacre of the Innocents|massacre of the children of Bethlehem]] planned by Herod, the ruler of the Roman province of Judea. Once Herod has died, an angel tells Joseph to return but to avoid Herod's son, and he takes his wife and the child to Nazareth in Galilee and settles there. Thus in Matthew, the infant Jesus, like Moses, is in peril from a cruel king, like Moses he has a (fore)father named Joseph who goes down to Egypt, like the Old Testament Joseph this Joseph has a father named Jacob, and both Josephs receive important dreams foretelling their future.<ref>Spong, John Shelby.

Subsequently, Jesus was born there. Luke's account makes no mention of him being visited by angels (Mary and various others instead receive similar visitations), the Massacre of the Innocents, or of a visit to Egypt.\n\nThe last time Joseph appears in person in any of the canonical Gospels is in the narrative of the [[Passover]] [[Finding in the Temple|visit to the Temple]] in Jerusalem when Jesus is 12 years old, which is found only in Luke.

[[Abraham]]'s nephew Lot (Genesis 11:26-28) was referred to as his brother (Genesis 14:14), as was [[Jacob]]'s uncle Laban (Genesis 29:15). Jesus himself frequently used the word \"brother\" as a generic term for one's fellow man. This custom has continued into modern times, with close friends, colleagues, and fellow churchgoers often called \"brothers and sisters.\" Generally, most Protestants read \"brothers and sisters\" of Jesus as referring specifically to children born of Mary. The doctrine of the [[Perpetual virginity of Mary]] means among other things that Joseph and Mary never had sexual relations.\n\nThe term ''[[Erusin|kiddushin]]'', which refers to the first part of a two-part marriage, is frequently translated as \"betrothal\".

Furthermore, there is a [[novena]] prayed before the feast of Saint Joseph on 19 March. Saint Joseph is frequently invoked for employment, daily protection, vocation, happy marriage, and a happy death.<ref>''Devotions to St. Joseph'' by Susanna Magdalene Flavius, 2008 {{ISBN|1-4357-0948-9}} pages 5\u201315</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Powerful Novena to St. Joseph for Work, Family, Job, Employment, to Sell House |url=https://www.thescottsmithblog.com/2020/11/powerful-novena-to-st-joseph-for-work.html |website=All Roads Lead to Rome |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref><ref>[[s:The Catholic Prayer Book and Manual of Meditations/Devotions to St Joseph|''Devotions to St. Joseph'' from The Catholic Prayer Book and Manual of Meditations by Patrick Francis Moran]]</ref>\n\nMultiple venerated Catholics have described their devotion to Saint Joseph and his intercession.

The Church celebrates a Feast in honour of St. Joseph on March 19th, and desires that all the faithful should honour him, ask for his intercession, and imitate his virtues. St. Joseph is the especial patron of the Church. Even as he was the protector of the Child Jesus on earth, so, we believe, is he now the protector of the mystical Body of Jesus, His holy Church. We also especially seek his intercession for a good death, because, having died so blessedly, in the presence and with the assistance of Jesus and Mary, he should be supplicated to obtain for us from Jesus the grace of a happy death.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=[[s:A Practical Commentary on Holy Scripture/IX.

He is now often portrayed as a younger or even youthful man (perhaps especially in [[Protestant]] depictions), whether going about his work as a carpenter, or participating actively in the daily life of Mary and Jesus as an equal and openly affectionate member.<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=4464 Finding St. Joseph by Sandra Miesel] gives a useful account of the changing views of Joseph in art and generally in Catholicism</ref> Art critic [[Waldemar Januszczak]] however emphasises the preponderance of Joseph's representation as an old man and sees this as the need:\n{{blockquote|to explain away his impotence: indeed to symbolise it.

She is virginal \u2013 it is Joseph's task to stand aside and let us desire her, religiously. It takes a particularly old, a particularly grey, a particularly kindly and a particularly feeble man to do that. ...Banished in vast numbers to the backgrounds of all those gloomy stables in all those [[ersatz]] Bethlehems, his complex iconographic task is to stand aside and let his wife be worshipped by the rest of us.<ref>Waldemar Januszczak, [http://www.waldemar.tv/2003/12/art-no-ordinary-joe/ \"No ordinary Joe\"], ''The Sunday Times'', December 2003</ref>}}\n\nHowever Carolyn Wilson challenges the long-held view that pre-Tridentine images were often intended to demean him.<ref>Wilson, Carolyn C., ''St. Joseph in Italian Renaissance Society and Art'', Saint Joseph's University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|9780916101367}}</ref> According to Charlene Villase\u00f1or Black, \"Seventeenth-century Spanish and Mexican artists reconceptualized Joseph as an important figure, ... representing him as the youthful, physically robust, diligent head of the Holy Family.\"<ref>Black, Charlene Villase\u00f1or, ''Creating the Cult of St. Joseph'', Princeton University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|9780691096315}}</ref> In [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s ''The Two Trinities'', Saint Joseph is given the same prominence as the Virgin.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nFull cycles of his life are rare in the Middle Ages, although the scenes from the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]'' or ''Life of Christ'' where he is present are far more often seen. The [[M\u00e9rode Altarpiece]] of about 1425, where he has a panel to himself, working as a carpenter, is an early example of what remained relatively rare depictions of him pursuing his m\u00e9tier.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSome statues of Joseph depict his staff as topped with flowers, recalling the non-canonical Gospel of James's account of how Mary's spouse was chosen by collecting the walking sticks of widowers in Palestine, and Joseph's alone bursting into flower, thus identifying him as divinely chosen.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The ''[[Golden Legend]]'', which derives its account from the much older [[Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew]], tells a similar story, although it notes that all marriageable men of the Davidic line and not only widowers were ordered by the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] to present their rods at the [[Second Temple|Temple]]. Several [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] [[icons]] show Joseph tempted by the [[Devil]] (depicted as an old man with furled wings) to break off his betrothal, and how he resists that temptation.
