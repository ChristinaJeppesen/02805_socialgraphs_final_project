In addition, he attempted a sitcom anthology, ''Benny Hill'', which ran from 1962 to 1963, in which he played a different character in each episode. In 1964, he played [[Nick Bottom]] in an all-star TV film production of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. He also had a radio programme lasting for three series called ''Benny Hill Time'' on [[BBC Radio]]'s [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]], from 1964 to 1966. It was a topical show; for example, a March 1964 episode featured James Pond, 0017, in \"From Moscow with Love\" and his version of [[The Beatles]]. He played a number of characters in the series, such as Harry Hill and Fred Scuttle.\n\n=== Films and recordings ===\nHill appeared in five full-length feature films\u2014''[[Who Done It? (1956 film)|Who Done It?]]'' (1956), ''[[Light Up the Sky!

''The Benny Hill Show'' had a music hall-derived format combining live on-stage comedy and filmed segments, and its humour relied on slapstick, innuendo and parody. Recurring players on his show during the BBC years included [[Patricia Hayes]], [[Jeremy Hawk]], Peter Vernon, [[Ronnie Brody]] and his co-writer from the early 1950s to early 1960s, [[Dave Freeman (British writer)|Dave Freeman]]. Short, bald [[Jackie Wright]] was a frequent supporting player who in many sketches had to put up with Hill slapping him on the top of his head.\n\nHill remained mostly with the BBC through to 1968, except for a few sojourns with [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Associated Television|ATV]] stations between 1957 and 1960 and again in 1967. In 1969, his show moved from the BBC to [[Thames Television]], where it remained until its cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials. The series showcased Hill's talents as an imaginative writer, comic performer and impressionist. He may have bought scripts from various comedy writers, but if so, they never received an onscreen credit (some evidence indicates he bought a script from one of his regular cast members in 1976, [[Cherri Gilham]], to whom he wrote from Spain, telling her he was using her \"Fat Lady\" idea on the show in January 1977).{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=29%|align=left|quote=\"To this day, ''The Benny Hill Show'', as watched by 21.1 million people in 1977, and which over the years won its star a [[BAFTA]], the [[Rose d'Or|Golden Rose of Montreux]], and a Variety Club Of Great Britain ITV Personality Of The Year award, remains the sole programme that spoke directly to the dream experience of the hot-blooded adolescent.

This was commonly filmed using \"under-cranking\" camera techniques and included other comic features such as jogging instead of a run at full speed and characters running off one side of the screen and reappearing running on from the other. The tune used in all the chases, [[Boots Randolph]]'s \"[[Yakety Sax]]\", is so strongly associated with the show that it is commonly referred to as \"The Benny Hill Theme\". It has been used as a form of [[parody]] in many ways by television shows and films. In a 2015 UK-wide poll the show's theme song was voted number 1 on the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] special ''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Sound of ITV \u2013 The Nation's Favourite Theme Tune]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week38/sound-itv-nations-favourite-theme-tune|title=The Sound of ITV: The Nation's Favourite Theme Tunes Episode 1|publisher=itv.com|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nFrom the start of the 1980s, the show featured a troupe of attractive young women, known collectively as \"Hill's Angels\". They would appear either on their own in a dance sequence or in character as foils against Hill. [[Sue Upton]] was one of the longest-serving members of the Angels. [[Jane Leeves]] appeared, as well. [[Henry McGee]] and [[Bob Todd]] joined Jackie Wright as comic supporting players, and the later shows also featured \"Hill's Little Angels\", a group of cute children including the families of [[Dennis Kirkland]] (the show's director) and Sue Upton.
