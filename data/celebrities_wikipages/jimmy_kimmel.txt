In 1989, Kimmel landed his first paying job alongside Voss as morning drive co-host of ''The Me and Him Show'' at [[KZOK-FM]] in Seattle, Washington. Over the next 10 months, the hosts performed several stunts on air, including one that led to an $8,000 loss in advertising.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Boss |first1=Kit |title=Sonic Boom: Kzok-Am Turns Up The Volume {{!}} The Seattle Times |url=https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19900201&slug=1053812 |access-date=March 24, 2020 |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 1, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Garrett |first1=Shawn |title=Jimmy Kimmel Comes To Seattle and Complains About Being Fired in 1990 |url=https://kzok.iheart.com/content/2019-03-27-jimmy-kimmel-comes-to-seattle-and-complains-about-being-fired-in-1990/ |access-date=March 24, 2020 |work=[[KZOK-FM]] |date=March 27, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Kimmel and Voss were fired by KZOK and were fired again a year later at [[WRBQ-FM]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].

He declined several offers for television shows from producer [[Michael Davies (television producer)|Michael Davies]], being uninterested in the projects, until he was offered a place as the comedic counterpart to [[Ben Stein]] on the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]'', which began airing on [[Comedy Central]] in 1997. His quick wit and \"[[everyman]]\" personality were counterpoints to Stein's monotonous vocal style and faux-[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] demeanor. The combination earned the pair an [[Emmy]] award for Best Game Show Host.<ref name=\"variety2016\"/>\n\nIn 1999, during his time on ''Win Ben Stein's Money'', Kimmel co-hosted (with [[Adam Carolla]]) and co-produced (with [[Daniel Kellison]]), Comedy Central's ''[[The Man Show]]''. Kimmel left ''Win Ben Stein's Money'' in 2001 and was replaced by comedian [[Nancy Pimental]], who was eventually replaced by Kimmel's cousin [[Sal Iacono]]. ''[[The Man Show]]''{{'}}s success allowed Kimmel, Carolla, and Kellison to create and produce, under the banner [[Jackhole Productions]], ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' for [[Comedy Central]] (on which Kimmel plays the characters \"Elmer Higgins\", \"Terrence Catheter\", \"The Nudge\", \"[[Karl Malone]]\" and himself) and later ''[[The Andy Milonakis Show]]'' for MTV2. Kimmel also produced and co-wrote the feature film ''[[Windy City Heat]]'', Festival Prize winner of the Comedia Award for Best Film at the 2004 [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].\n\n=== ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'' ===\n{{Main|Jimmy Kimmel Live!}}\n\nIn January 2003, Kimmel permanently left ''The Man Show'' to host his own late-night talk show, ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. In the April 2007 issue of Stuffmagazine.com, Kimmel was named the \"biggest badass on TV\". Kimmel said it was an honor but clearly a mistake.\n\nDespite its name, the show has not actually aired live since 2004, when censors were unable to properly [[bleep censor]] a barrage of swearing from actor [[Thomas Jane]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url = https://www.vulture.com/2012/10/jimmy-kimmel-live-gets-new-time-slot.html |title = Jimmy Kimmel Takes On Brooklyn And Two New Rivals |last = Yuan |first = Jada |magazine = [[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] |date = October 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2004 NBA Finals]] in Detroit, Kimmel appeared on ABC's halftime show to make an on-air plug for his show. He suggested that if the [[Detroit Pistons]] defeated the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], \"they're gonna burn the city of Detroit down ... and it's not worth it.\" Officials with Detroit's ABC affiliate, [[WXYZ-TV]], immediately announced that that night's show would not air on the station.

He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon on the red carpet one time and, before he could finish the interview, said, \"Sorry, we are out of time.\" The most recent encounter was titled \"The Handsome Men's Club\" which featured Kimmel, along with the \"Handsome Men\", who were: [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Patrick Dempsey]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Keith Urban]], [[John Krasinski]], [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Tony Romo]], [[Ted Danson]], [[Taye Diggs]], [[Gilles Marini]], and [[Ben Affleck]], speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit, Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by Damon, who says they have run out of time and laughs sinisterly. [[Jennifer Garner]] also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' appear on ''Jimmy Kimmel Live!'', causing Kimmel to describe himself as \"the [[Cerberus|three-headed dog]] the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell.\"\n\nDuring a November 2022 appearance on [[Stitcher]]\u2019s \"Naked Lunch\" podcast, Kimmel revealed he told ABC executives, soon after the election of Donald Trump, that if he could not tell Trump jokes, then he would leave the show. Kimmel also indicated the executives were correct, and he lost approximately half of his audience during that time.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sharf |first=Zack |url=https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-threatened-abc-quit-show-block-trump-jokes-1235422576/ |title=Jimmy Kimmel Told ABC He'd Quit if Execs Stopped Him From Making Trump Jokes: 'They Knew I Was Serious' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2022-11-03 |accessdate=2022-11-04 }}</ref>\n\n==== Controversy ====\nIn October 2013, a new segment of the show, \"Kids Table\", showcased five- and six-year-olds discussing the U.S. government shutdown and U.S. debts.
