In the late 1960s, Reiner acted in bit roles in several television shows including ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'',<ref>{{Citation|title=\"Batman\" The Penguin Declines (TV Episode 1967) |work=IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519542/fullcredits|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> ''[[That Girl]]'',''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Room 222]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.

He began his career writing for the ''[[Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' in 1968 and 1969, with [[Steve Martin]] as his writing partner as the two youngest writers on the show.\n\nTwo years later, Reiner became famous playing Michael Stivic, Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, on [[Norman Lear]]'s 1970s situation comedy ''[[All in the Family]]'', which was the most-watched television program in the United States for five seasons (1971\u20131976). The character's nickname, \"Meathead\", (given to him by his cantankerous father-in-law Archie) became closely associated with him, even after he had left the role and went on to build a career as a director.

In 1972, Reiner, Phil Mishkin, and Gerry Isenberg created the situation comedy ''[[The Super (TV series)|The Super]]'' for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Starring [[Richard S. Castellano]], the show depicted the life of the harried Italian American [[Building superintendent|superintendent]] of a New York City [[apartment building]] and ran for 10 episodes in the summer of 1972. Reiner and Mishkin co-wrote the premiere episode.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Reiner became known as a director of several successful Hollywood films that spanned many different genres. Some of his earlier films include cult classics such as the rock-band [[mockumentary]]  ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' (1984) and the comedic fantasy film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), as well as his period piece coming of age tale ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'' (1986). He often collaborates with film editor [[Robert Leighton (film editor)|Robert Leighton]], whom he also shares with fellow director-actor [[Christopher Guest]] as their go-to editor.\n\nReiner has gone on to direct other critically and commercially successful films with his own company, [[Castle Rock Entertainment]].

He served as the first chairman of First 5 California, from 1999 to 2006. Reiner came under criticism for campaigning for a ballot measure (Prop 82) to fund state-run preschools while still chair of the First Five Commission, causing him to resign from his position on March 29, 2006. An audit was conducted, and it concluded that the state commission did not violate state law and that it had clear legal authority to conduct its public advertising campaigns related to preschool. Prop 82 failed to win approval, garnering only 39.1% support.\n\nReiner is a member of the Social Responsibility Task Force, an organization advocating moderation where social issues (such as violence and tobacco use) and the entertainment industry meet.
