In 1969, he returned with another series, ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', a situation comedy that ran for two seasons. Cosby played a physical education teacher at a Los Angeles high school. While only a modest critical success, the show was a ratings hit, finishing eleventh in its first season. Cosby was lauded for using African-American performers such as [[Lillian Randolph]], [[Moms Mabley]], and [[Rex Ingram (actor)|Rex Ingram]] as characters. According to commentary on the Season{{nbsp}}1 DVDs for the show, Cosby was at odds with NBC over his refusal to include a [[laugh track]] in the show, as he felt viewers had the ability to find humor for themselves when watching a TV show.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFor the [[PBS]] series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]'', Cosby recorded several segments teaching reading skills to young children.<ref>{{cite web|first=Elizabeth|last=Blair|url=https://news.azpm.org/p/news-npr/2021/10/25/202413-50-years-ago-the-electric-company-used-comedy-to-boost-kids-reading-skills/|title=50 years ago, 'The Electric Company' used comedy to boost kids' reading skills|website=Arizona Public Media|date=October 25, 2021|accessdate=October 26, 2021}}</ref> Cosby resumed his formal education in 1971; he began graduate work at  [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]].

More successful was a [[Saturday-morning cartoon]], ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', hosted by Cosby and based on his own childhood. That series ran from 1972 to 1979, then ran as ''The New Fat Albert Show'' in 1979, and finally ran as ''The Adventures of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids''. Cosby would use his experience producing ''Fat Albert'' in his educational endeavors; his [[dissertation]] for his [[Doctor of Education|Ed. D.]] at UMass Amherst discussed the use of ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' as a teaching tool in elementary schools. \n\nDuring the 1970s, Cosby and other African-American actors, including [[Sidney Poitier]], joined forces to make successful [[comedy film]]s to counter the violent \"[[blaxploitation]]\" films of the era, such as ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' in 1974; ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' in 1975; and in 1976, ''[[Mother, Jugs & Speed]]'', co-starring [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Harvey Keitel]].\n\nIn 1976, Cosby starred in ''[[A Piece of the Action (film)|A Piece of the Action]]'' with Poitier; and ''[[California Suite (film)|California Suite]]'', a compilation of four [[Neil Simon]] plays. He also hosted ''[[Cos (TV series)|Cos]]'' in 1976. In addition, he produced an hour-long variety show featuring puppets, sketches, and musical numbers. It was during this season that ABC decided to take advantage of this phase of Cosby's career, by joining with [[Filmation]] producers of ''Fat Albert'' to create live-action segments starring Cosby, for the 1972 animated film ''[[Journey Back to Oz]]''; it subsequently aired in syndication.
