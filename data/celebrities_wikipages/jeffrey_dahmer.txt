Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=141}} Inside the apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills, then [[Strangling#Manual strangulation|manually strangled]] him.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}}\n\nThe following day, Dahmer purchased a [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilax, which allowed him to rinse the bones in his sink.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=142}} Dahmer dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton\u2014excluding the skull\u2014in a container filled with acid.

He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching, which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle, Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture. Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim was acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry\u2014a process that caused the skull to explode.

Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed, \"That'll cost you extra\", whereupon Dahmer gave Miller a drink laced with two sleeping pills.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nOn this occasion, Dahmer had only two sleeping pills to give his victim. Therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his [[carotid artery]] with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=154}} Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing it in his bathtub for dismemberment.

To preserve the skeleton, Dahmer placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24 hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week. The severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.{{sfn|Masters|1993|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nThree weeks after the murder of Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old father of two named David Thomas at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue Mall]].{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=217}} He persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer said that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awaken, fearing that he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body\u2014intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. He photographed the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's identification.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=217}}\n\nFollowing the murder of Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=153}} He regularly complained of feelings of both anxiety and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990, with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, financial difficulties, and\u2014shortly before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]\u2014his apprehension regarding meeting and facing his father and younger brother.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=83}} On several occasions, Dahmer also referred to harboring [[suicidal thought]]s.{{sfn|Norris|1992|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\n====1991 killings====\nIn February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near [[Marquette University]].

Dahmer drugged Straughter, cuffed his hands behind his back, then strangled him to death with a leather strap.

On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive. After unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with [[chloroform]],{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=190}} he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}}\n\nAfter strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=181}} Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=184}} Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed the sheet to find the head covered in maggots. He decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=185}} He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.{{sfn|Dvorchak|Holewa|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=258}}\n\n==Arrest==\n===Capture===\nOn July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs,{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=15}} drink beer and simply keep him company.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=192}} One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, \"What's happening?\" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a videotape of ''[[The Exorcist&nbsp;III]]'' was playing.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=192}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Worthington|first=Rogers|title=Dahmer Escapee Tells of Close Call|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-02-01-9201100268-story.html|date=February 1, 1992|access-date=October 29, 2021|work=The Chicago Tribune|archive-date=January 29, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220129151552/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-02-01-9201100268-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He also noted a blue [[drum (container)|57-gallon drum]] in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=152}}\n\nDahmer then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV. Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him. He placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=23}}\n\nIn continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=24}} Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity. When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning. Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=27}} When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAt 11:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers, Robert Rauth and Rolf Mueller, at the corner of North 25th Street.

When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=2}}\n\nWhen the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to retrieve the key himself, whereupon the second officer present, Rauth, informed him to \"back off\".{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}}\n\nIn the bedroom, Mueller noted there was a large knife beneath the bed. He saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures\u2014many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the same apartment in which they were standing. Mueller walked into the living room to show them to his partner,<ref name=\"Bardsley-4\"/> uttering the words, \"These are for real.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=3}}\n\nWhen Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to [[resisting arrest|resist arrest]].

At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf.{{sfn|Norris|1992|p=33}} As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: \"For what I did I should be dead.\"{{sfn|Masters|1993|p=4}}\n\nA more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Milwaukee police's Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer's kitchen.
