He joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/german/germ_1949a/wulff.php |title=Biography of Wulff, Christian |publisher=Archontology.org |access-date=17 February 2012}}</ref> In 1987 and 1990, he passed the first and second state examinations in law, and has since worked as an attorney.\n\n==Political career==\nSince 1975, Wulff has been a member of the CDU. From 1978 to 1980, he served as federal chairman of the ''Sch\u00fclerunion'', a political high school student organization affiliated with the Christian Democrats. From 1979 to 1983, he was on the executive board of the [[Junge Union]] and became its state chairman in [[Lower Saxony]] in 1983. However, he decided to resign from the board in order to pursue his law degree, which he completed in 1986. The same year, he was elected a city councillor in his hometown. Since 1984, he sat on the CDU's state party council of Lower Saxony, serving as its chairman from 1994 to 2008.\n\n[[File:KAS-Wulff, Christian-Bild-5748-5.jpg|right|thumb|Wulff as candidate for the [[1994 Lower Saxony state election]].]]\nThe Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for Minister President of the state in the run-up of the 1994 parliamentary election. However, the popular incumbent [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] won an absolute majority in the Lower Saxony legislature, while the state CDU under Wulff received one of its worst results, leading some observers to doubt the wisdom of the provincial party nominating a young and neophyte candidate for Premier. After four years in opposition, the [[1998 Lower Saxony state election|1998 legislative assembly election]] brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Minister President. Indeed, the federal Christian Democrat party, led by Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], pinned their hopes on Wulff \u2013 a Wulff victory would have stopped the inevitable rise of Schr\u00f6der to the Social Democrat nomination for Chancellor. However, supported by a wave of sympathy for his potential candidacy for chancellor in the [[1998 German federal election|1998 federal election]], Schr\u00f6der was returned to power by an enhanced majority \u2013 leaving Wulff to serve five more years as state leader of the opposition.\n\nSchr\u00f6der won the 1998 federal election, leaving the post of Minister President to his anointed successor, Interior minister [[Gerhard Glogowski]]. The latter soon stumbled over a scandal involving free travel paid by [[TUI AG|TUI]] and was succeeded by young parliamentary leader [[Sigmar Gabriel]]. In the wake of the 1999 scandal, as well as rising discontent with Schr\u00f6der's federal cabinet, the Christian Democrats rose in the opinion polls and became a serious contender for power in the [[2003 Lower Saxony state election|2003 parliamentary election]].\n\nWulff had been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level after {{Nowrap|7 November}} 1998, and had been a board member of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]] after 2003.\n\n===2003 state election===\nWith Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services, the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign. Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election and essentially campaigned on a platform of fiscal restraint and clear-cut reforms in the areas of law enforcement and education. Both issues were decisive in the elections that led to a change in fortunes for the two major parties. The Christian Democrats, in the political wilderness since the 1990 Schr\u00f6der victory, were returned to power with an absolute majority in the state parliament, gaining 48.3% of the vote. Wulff was sworn in as Minister President on {{Nowrap|4 March}} 2003, as the head of a coalition between centre-right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]).\n\n===Policies===\nAs Minister President of Lower Saxony, Wulff pursued a multitude of reforms, including a restructuration of the primary education system in the state, as well as an increase of police officers on the beat. When Wulff took office, Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis, resulting from years of public deficits. Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance. The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind. Other policies concern the reform of the administration (especially the abolition of certain district authorities). Budgetary problems continued to overshadow Wulff's policies, albeit with somewhat less pressure. Many measures have remained controversial.\n\nPrior to the [[2005 German federal election|2005 federal election]], Wulff was mentioned as a potential candidate for the federal chancellorship. In a spring 2005 poll, 28% of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democratic nomination for Chancellor.<ref>[http://www.n24.de/politik/inland/index.php/a2004120109373045486 n24.de] {{in lang|de}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050421181559/http://www.n24.de/politik/inland/index.php/a2004120109373045486 |date=21 April 2005 }}</ref> As Wulff had only began his first term as Minister President of Lower Saxony in early 2003, he largely dismissed such speculations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftd.de/pw/de/1102146523308.html?nv=cpm|title=In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft|first=Peter|last=Ehrlich|work=[[Financial Times Deutschland]]|date=8 December 2004|access-date=8 July 2010|language=de}}</ref> Speculation had particularly increased since the December 2004 Christian Democratic federal convention in D\u00fcsseldorf, when Wulff was reelected deputy leader of the federal party with roughly 86% of all delegates supporting him. However, the premature dissolution of the Bundestag in 2005 and the subsequent election of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] largely put an end to further speculation about Wulff's future at the time.\n\nA Wulff candidacy for the CDU nomination for Chancellor was seen to appeal to northerners and liberals within the Christian Democrats. Outside the mold of a typical conservative, he was able to attract swing voters disillusioned with the slowness of reforms, as well as the then rather high rates of unemployment in Germany. Indeed, he worked on increasing his visibility beyond Lower Saxony's confines, particularly by appearing frequently on television shows and giving interviews to the national newspapers. Moreover, Wulff was also acquiring a profile on a broad range of issues, including the reform of the German language, Medicare and social security reform, as well as a modernisation of Germany's federal constitution, the ''Grundgesetz''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/s/Rub6EAA9BF249C249FE86A5EFF3F83DC130/Doc~E339323623A95412081F4B5DEC6308A30~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html|title=Wie macht das blo\u00df der Wulff?|work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|date=21 October 2004|access-date=8 July 2010|language=de}}</ref> In fact, he criticised the consensus reached between the Christian Democratic and Social Democratic parties on the modernisation of [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's constitution]], stating that he felt that the states (''L\u00e4nder'') had not been given sufficient powers to deal with their own affairs. Wulff also took a conservative stand on nuclear energy, advocating an extension of the deadlines for the [[Nuclear power phase-out|decommissioning of Germany's nuclear reactors]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/aktuell/meldungen/0,1185,OID5113864_REF2,00.html|title=Auch Wulff fordert l\u00e4ngere Laufzeiten|work=[[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]]|date=6 January 2006|access-date=8 July 2010|language=de}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn a speech, Wulff also expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values. This was seen as the first attempt to formulate a value-based agenda for the 2008 state, as well as more importantly, the [[2009 German federal election|2009 federal election]]. In this context, it is important to note that Chancellor Merkel had been severely criticised for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign, leading to a worse-than-expected result for the Christian Democrats.\n\nWulff announced on 8 January 2006 that Lower Saxony would become the first state to approve a new model according to which the government will temporarily pay part of the salaries for low-salary jobs, if the employers concerned are willing to employ an employee concerned on a long-term basis. This pilot was supposed to make new jobs more affordable in Germany's notoriously high-wages environment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article189672/Niedersachsen_fuehrt_Kombilohn_ein.html|title=Niedersachsen f\u00fchrt Kombilohn ein|first=Stefan|last=von Borstel|work=[[Die Welt]]|date=9 January 2006|access-date=8 July 2010|language=de}}</ref>\n\n===Wulff and the 2005 federal elections===\nDue to his popularity in Lower Saxony, and in federal opinion polls, Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor.\n\nAfter the 23 May announcement that federal elections were to be advanced to [[2005 German federal election|September 2005]], Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor, particularly as he had not completed his first term as Minister President of Lower Saxony. Instead, Wulff declared his support for CDU party and parliamentary leader [[Angela Merkel]]. Although there was speculation that Wulff would be given a position in the new government, entering federal politics, he remained Minister President of Lower Saxony.\n\n===President of Germany===\n{{see also|List of presidential trips made by Christian Wulff}}\n[[File:CFK y Christian Wulff.jpg|thumb|2010 meeting with his Argentine counterpart [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Kirchner]]]]\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Germany, November 2011-2.jpeg|thumbnail|Wulff with then-President of Russia [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in 2011|alt=]]\nWulff was elected [[President of Germany]] on {{Nowrap|30 June}} 2010 to follow [[Horst K\u00f6hler]], who had resigned on 31 May 2010.
