At the age of six, she appeared on ''[[Candid Camera]]''. Later that year she appeared in a [[Max Factor]] cosmetic advertising campaign with model [[Cristina Ferrare]].

She died within a year at the age of 47, after which Bleeth dealt with her grief, thus: \"I stayed home, watching cooking shows, taking walks.\" She turned down acting offers for eight months, but then won the role of [[LeeAnn Demerest]] on the daytime soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]''.<ref name=People/>\n\n==Later career (1993\u20132003)==\nBleeth's role of Caroline Holden on ''[[Baywatch]]'' brought her widespread attention. ''[[People Magazine|People]]'' named her one of magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People in 1995. She was one of ''[[FHM]]''&#39;s [[FHM's 100 Sexiest Women (UK)|100 Sexiest Women in the World]] every year from 1996 to 2001, and ''FHM''&#39;s U.S. 100 Sexiest Women every year from 2000 to 2003. As a result of her role in ''Baywatch'', Bleeth was offered other roles in television and film. She has been a featured actress in five series and has guest-starred in other shows. During her television career, she continued to work as a model, frequently appearing in swimwear or lingerie. She once had her own line of swimwear called ''Yaz Wear.''  From 1998 to 2000, Bleeth played the role of inspector Caitlin Cross on ''[[Nash Bridges]]''.\n\nBleeth accepted a starring role in the short-lived series ''[[Titans (2000 TV series)|Titans]]'' in 2000. [[Aaron Spelling]] was so eager to cast Bleeth in the role of a vixen on ''Titans'' that his company convinced [[CBS]] to grant her an early release from her ''Nash Bridges'' contract. In an interview with Dennis Hensley,<!-- Who is Hensley?? --> she said she delighted in her over-the-top depiction of a crazed beauty queen in the 1997 TV film ''[[Crowned and Dangerous]]''.  She said, \"I keep my crown from that film on my desk in a little Lucite box. My little brother tried it on once, and I screamed at him, 'Take it off! Take it off!'
