{{IPAc-cmn|x|i|2|-|j|in|4|-|p|ing|2}}; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician who has served as the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|general secretary]] of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)|chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), and thus as the [[paramount leader]] of China, since 2012. Xi has also served as the [[president of the People's Republic of China]] (PRC) since 2013.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], Xi was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. He lived in a [[yaodong]] in the village of Liangjiahe, [[Shaanxi|Shaanxi province]], where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]]. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at [[Tsinghua University]] as a [[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student|worker-peasant-soldier student]], Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was [[governor of Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring [[Politics of Zhejiang|Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Secretariat]] in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as [[Hu Jintao]]'s presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]] as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president of the PRC]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission|vice chairman of the CMC]]. He officially received the title of [[leadership core]] from the CCP in 2016.\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment of the PRC]]. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including a [[Zhou Yongkang|former member]] of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013United States relations|China's relations with the U.S]]., the [[nine-dash line]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]], and the [[political status of Taiwan]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]]. Xi has expanded support for [[state-owned enterprise]]s (SOEs), advanced [[military-civil fusion]], overseen [[Targeted Poverty Alleviation|targeted poverty alleviation]] programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted \"[[common prosperity]]\", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. \n\nXi [[Ma\u2013Xi meeting|met]] with Taiwanese president [[Ma Ying-jeou]] in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after [[Tsai Ing-wen]] of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China]] with a [[zero-COVID]] approach, continuing it (as of December 2022) even after most other countries had shifted to a [[mitigation strategy]]. Xi also oversaw the passage of a [[Hong Kong national security law|national security law in Hong Kong]], clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially [[Pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy activists]].\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]], deterioration in [[Human rights in China|human rights]], including the [[Xinjiang internment camps|internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang]] (which some observers have described as part of [[Uyghur genocide|a genocide]]), a [[Xi Jinping's cult of personality|cult of personality]] developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as [[Xi Jinping Thought]], have been incorporated into the [[Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party|party]] and [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|national constitutions]], and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the [[National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party|National Security Commission]] and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Committee]] passed a \"[[Third Resolution of the CPC Central Committee on the Major Achievements and Historical Experience of the Party over the Past Century|historical resolution]]\" in November 2021, the third such resolution after [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second [[Leader of the Chinese Communist Party|leader of the CCP]] to do so (the other being Mao).\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953, the second son of [[Xi Zhongxun]] and his wife [[Qi Xin]]. After the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|founding of the PRC]] in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including [[Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party|Party propaganda]] chief, [[Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China|vice-premier]], and [[Vice Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|vice chairperson of the National People's Congress]].<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/china-profile-xi-jinping/24764283.html|title=Profile: Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping|date=7 November 2012|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|access-date=26 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083336/http://www.rferl.org/content/china-profile-xi-jinping/24764283.html|archive-date=19 October 2013}}</ref> Xi had two older sisters, [[Qi Qiaoqiao|Qiaoqiao]], born in 1949 and An'an ({{zh|c=\u5b89\u5b89|p=\u0100n'\u0101n|labels=no}}), born in 1952.<ref name=\":25\">{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/book/2009-04/28/content_11270872.htm |script-title=zh:\u8207\u4e08\u592b\u7fd2\u4ef2\u52db\u76f8\u4f3458\u5e74 \u9f4a\u5fc3\uff1a\u9019\u8f29\u5b50\u7121\u6bd4\u5e78\u798f |date=28 April 2009 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |language=zh-Hant|trans-title=With her husband Xi Zhongxun for 58 years: very happy in this life|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128102212/http://news.xinhuanet.com/book/2009-04/28/content_11270872.htm|archive-date=28 January 2013|access-date=18 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"laoren2\">{{cite web|url=http://book.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2013/0527/c69360-21628126.html |last=Xu|first=Xinyi|date=27 May 2013|website=[[People's Daily]]|language=zh-Hant|script-title=zh:\u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\"\u5bb6\u98a8\"\u63ed\u79d8 \u9f4a\u5fc3\u81ea\u8ff0\u8207\u7fd2\u4ef2\u52db\u5a5a\u59fb\u5f80\u4e8b|trans-title=Xi Jinping's \"family traditions\" are unmasked: Qi Xin's autobiographical account of her marriage to Xi Zhongxun|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428053410/http://book.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2013/0527/c69360-21628126.html|archive-date=28 April 2017|access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref> Xi's father was from [[Fuping County, Shaanxi|Fuping County]], Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his [[patrilineal]] descent from Xiying in [[Dengzhou]], Henan.<ref name=\":26\">{{cite news |url=http://hn.wenweipo.com/news/zhuanti/2012-11-16/23713.html |script-title=zh:\u672c\u5831\u7368\u5bb6\u63a2\u8a2a\u6cb3\u5357\u9127\u5dde\u7fd2\u71df\u6751|last=Fangqin|first=Sun|date=16 November 2012|work=[[Wen Wei Po]]|access-date=15 November 2012|language=zh-Hant|trans-title=This Newspaper's Exclusive Visit To Xiying Village, Dengzhou County, Henan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123040758/http://hn.wenweipo.com/news/zhuanti/2012-11-16/23713.html|archive-date=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nXi went to the Beijing No. 25 School,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Li |first1=Cheng |title=Xi Jinping's Inner Circle (Part 2: Friends from Xi's Formative Years) |url=https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/clm44cl.pdf |access-date=15 July 2020 |website=[[Hoover Institution]] |publisher= |pages=6\u201322}}</ref> and then [[Beijing Bayi School]],<ref name=Takahashi>{{cite web|last=Takahashi|first=Tetsushi|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Beijing-Diary/Connecting-the-dots-of-the-Hong-Kong-law-and-veneration-of-Xi|title=Connecting the dots of the Hong Kong law and veneration of Xi |newspaper=[[Nikkei Shimbun]]|date=1 June 2002|access-date=23 October 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"newyorker2\" /> in the 1960s.

These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials ([[Su Rong]], [[Bai Enpei]], [[Wan Qingliang]]), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs ([[Song Lin]], [[Liu Tienan]]), and highly ranked generals in the military ([[Gu Junshan]]).
