A bypass is what happened to me when I didn't get ''The Tonight Show!'' It's a whole different thing.\" In a later running gag, he lobbied Indiana to rename the freeway circling Indianapolis ([[Interstate 465|I-465]]) \"The David Letterman Bypass\". He also featured a montage of faux news coverage of his bypass surgery, which included a clip of Letterman's heart for sale on the [[Home Shopping Network]].
