Some of the members committed [[Manson Family#Crimes|a series of nine murders]] at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit murder for the [[Tate\u2013LaBianca murders|deaths of seven people]], including the film actress [[Sharon Tate]]. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/61/102.html|title=People v.

While gathering his cult following, Manson was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]], who introduced Manson to record producer [[Terry Melcher]]. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song \"Cease to Exist\", renamed \"[[Never Learn Not to Love]]\" as a single B-side, but without a credit to Manson. Afterward, Manson attempted to secure a record contract through Melcher, but was unsuccessful.\n\nManson would often talk about [[the Beatles]], including their [[The Beatles (album)|eponymous 1968 album]]. According to [[Los Angeles County District Attorney]], [[Vincent Bugliosi]], Manson felt guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term \"[[Helter Skelter (scenario)|Helter Skelter]]\" to describe an impending apocalyptic [[Ethnic conflict|race war]]. During his trial, Bugliosi argued that Manson had intended to start a race war, although Manson and others disputed this. Contemporary interviews and trial witness testimony insisted that the Tate\u2013LaBianca murders were [[copycat crime]]s intended to exonerate Manson's friend [[Bobby Beausoleil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/manson-murders-motive-copycat.php|title=Manson Murders Motive {{!}} Copycat Motive|website=www.cielodrive.com|access-date=May 11, 2019|archive-date=May 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190511010512/http://www.cielodrive.com/manson-murders-motive-copycat.php|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">Day, James Buddy (Director). 2017.

Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. However, in January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. Manson was transferred to the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Petersburg|Federal Reformatory]] in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. There he committed a further \"eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts\". He was then moved to a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] [[Chillicothe Correctional Institution|reformatory]] at [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen.{{sfn|Guinn|2013|p=52}}\n[[File:Charles Manson mugshot FCI Terminal Island California 1956-05-02 3845-CAL.png|thumb|right|Booking photo, Federal Correctional Institute Terminal Island, May 2, 1956]]\n\nIn January 1955, Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis.{{sfn|Manson|1988}}{{page needed|date=July 2020}} Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in [[Los Angeles]] in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. Manson's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in [[Florida]] resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136\u2013146}}\n\nWhile Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son, Charles Manson Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years' probation and his parole was denied.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136\u2013146}}\n\n=== Second imprisonment ===\nManson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a 10-year [[suspended sentence]] and probation after a young woman named Leona, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a \"tearful plea\" before the court that she and Manson were \"deeply in love&nbsp;... and would marry if Charlie were freed\".{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136\u2013146}} Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so she [[Spousal privilege|would not be required]] to testify against him.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136\u2013146}}\n\nManson took Leona and another woman to [[New Mexico]] for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the [[Mann Act]]. Though he was released, Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a [[Arrest warrant#Bench warrant|bench warrant]] was issued. An [[indictment]] for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960.{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136\u2013146}} Following the arrest of one of the women for prostitution, Manson was arrested in June in [[Laredo, Texas]], and was returned to Los Angeles.

In July 1961, he was transferred from the [[Los Angeles County Jail]] to the [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|United States Penitentiary]] at [[McNeil Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. There, he took guitar lessons from [[Barker\u2013Karpis gang]] leader [[Alvin Karpis#Imprisonment|Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis]], and obtained from another inmate a contact name of someone at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]].<ref>{{cite web |access-date=July 2, 2012 |url=http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |work=Lost in the Grooves |title=Short Bits 2 \u2013 Charles Manson and the Beach Boys |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718010206/http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |archive-date=July 18, 2012  |date=April 13, 2006 }}</ref> Among his fellow prisoners during this time was [[Danny Trejo]], who participated in several hypnosis sessions.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-07-07|title=Danny Trejo Says Charles Manson Once Hypnotized Him in Jail|url=https://www.mediaite.com/entertainment/danny-trejo-says-charles-manson-once-hypnotized-him-in-jail/|access-date=2021-07-07|website=Mediaite|language=en|archive-date=July 7, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210707202624/https://www.mediaite.com/entertainment/danny-trejo-says-charles-manson-once-hypnotized-him-in-jail/|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Jeff Guinn's 2013 biography of Manson, his mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.<ref name=\"Rule/Guinn\">{{cite magazine |last=Rule |first=Ann |title=There Will Be Blood |journal=The New York Times Book Review |date=August 18, 2013 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense.

By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws.

The female defendants testified that the Tate-LaBianca murders were intended to be [[copycat crime]]s, similar to the Hinman killing.

The state prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, later speculated in his book, ''Helter Skelter'', that they refrained from doing so, in order to not appear to be completely controlled by Manson (as they had when they each carved an \"X\" in their foreheads, earlier in the trial).{{sfn|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=571\u2013572}}\n\nOn March 29, 1971, the jury sentenced all four defendants to death.

He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Jerome \"Shorty\" Shea. Following the 1972 decision of ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'', California's death sentences were ruled unconstitutional and that \"any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death.\"<ref>[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/6C3d628.htm ''People v.
