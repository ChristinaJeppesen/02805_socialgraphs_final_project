In 1996, Forbes supported a flat tax of 17% on all personal and corporate earned income (unearned income such as [[capital gains]], [[pension]]s, [[inheritance]], and [[savings]] would be exempt). However, Forbes supported keeping the first $33,000 of income exempt. In 2000, Forbes maintained the same plan; however, instead of each person receiving an exemption of $33,000, it more closely resembled the Armey Plan (Forbes's version called for a $13,000-per-adult and $5,000-per-dependent deduction). Forbes is very wealthy, with a [[net worth]] in 1996 of $430 million.<ref name=\"wealth\"/> In response to this criticism, Forbes promised in his 2000 campaign to exempt himself from the benefits of the flat tax, although he did support the repeal of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]] in a debate with [[Alan Keyes]] the previous year.\n\nIn his 2000 campaign, Forbes professed his support for [[social conservatism]] along with his [[supply-side economics]]. Despite holding opposite positions in 1996, for the 2000 campaign Forbes announced he was adamantly opposed to [[abortion]] and supported [[school prayer|prayer]] in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]. The previous year Forbes had issued a statement saying he would no longer donate money to [[Princeton University]] because of its hiring of philosopher [[Peter Singer]], who views personhood as being limited to 'sentient' beings and therefore considers some disabled people and all infants to lack this status. Steve Forbes was one of the signers of the Statement of Principles of [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) on June 3, 1997.\n\n===Other political activities===\nIn 1996, Forbes campaigned on behalf of [[Ron Paul]] in the congressional election for [[Texas's 14th congressional district]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/magazine/22Paul-t.html?ei=5124&en=22ee37525a9fc4f5&ex=1343016000&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|title=The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul|date=July 22, 2007|first=Christopher|last=Caldwell|access-date=September 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\nActor [[Mark McKinney]] played Steve Forbes on the comedy television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a program known for featuring [[political satire]].
