In Metallica's ''[[Behind the Music]]'', Claypool said that he jokingly asked the others if they wanted to \"jam on some [[Isley Brothers]] tunes\" during the audition, a reference to his limited experience in the [[thrash metal]] scene. Metallica frontman [[James Hetfield]] remarked that Claypool was not offered the job because \"he was too good\" and \"should do his own thing.\"{{cn|date=May 2021}} In a 2014 interview with [[Boing Boing]],<ref name=BoingBoing2014>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCGFddeI8Ng Les Claypool on his Metallica audition], accessed March 7, 2018</ref> Claypool said that Hammett had given him a copy of ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'' (1984) which he enjoyed, but overall \"wasn't a big metal guy\"<sup>0:27</sup> and \"didn't realize how big Metallica were, to tell you the truth\"<sup>0:45</sup> until he arrived at the audition. In retrospect, Claypool admitted \"I wasn't the right guy\" and characterized himself as a \"weirdo\" and furthermore believed that Hetfield was \"being nice\" in saying Claypool was too good for Metallica.\n\n=== Primus ===\n{{Main|Primus (band)}}\n[[File:Primus copenhagen 1998 (cropped Les).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Claypool in 1998]]\n\n[[Primus (band)|Primus]] began as \"Primate\" in the mid 1980s, with Claypool on bass, [[Todd Huth]] on guitar, and various drummers, most notably [[Jay Lane]], though Huth and Lane left shortly thereafter to pursue other projects. Claypool replaced them with guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]] and drummer [[Tim Alexander]].\n\nClaypool is considered to be the leader of the band, as well as the driving force behind its blending of [[Funk music|funk]] with other genres. Claypool frequently utilizes the slap-bass technique, prominent in funk music, and is the only member of Primus who comes from a funk background. Because of Claypool's strong funk influence, Primus is often described as \"[[Thrash metal|thrash]]-funk\" or [[funk metal]],<ref name=\"Spin Jan 91\">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9fMwxwJ7tkC&pg=PA39 |page=39 |title=The Thrash-Funk scene proudly presents Primus |last1=Darzin |first1=Daina |last2=Spencer |first2=Lauren |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=January 1991 |volume=6 |number=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/primus-set-release-new-album-green-naugahyde-september |title=Primus Set To Release New Album, 'Green Naugahyde,' This September |last=Hart |first=Josh |date=June 6, 2011 |work=Guitar World |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924125326/http://www.guitarworld.com/primus-set-release-new-album-green-naugahyde-september |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/04/entertainment/ca-40260 |date=December 4, 1999 |title=Primus Mixes Metal With a Bit of Satire |last=Weingarten |first=Mark |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref name=\"MusicOMH 2014\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/primus-primus-chocolate-factory-fungi-ensemble |title=Album Reviews: Primus \u2013 Primus & The Chocolate Factory and the Fungi Ensemble |date=November 3, 2014 |first=Dylan |last=Kilby |journal=Music OMH }}</ref> though Claypool dislikes these labels, stating: \"We've been lumped in with the funk metal thing just about everywhere.

Claypool and [[Tom Waits]] first recorded on each other's records in 1991 and have continued to do so since. In 1997, Primus was asked to play and record the theme song for the animated television show ''[[South Park]]''. In 1999, he allowed Activision's use of the song \"[[Jerry Was a Race Car Driver]]\" in the popular video game ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater]]''. Primus went on hiatus in 2000.\n\nIn mid-2003, Claypool reunited with former Primus drummer Tim Alexander and guitarist Larry LaLonde to record a DVD/EP called ''[[Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People]]''. In October of the same year, the band embarked on a two-month tour in which two sets were performed per show, the second set consisting of their 1991 release ''[[Sailing the Seas of Cheese]]'' being performed in its entirety. Primus continued touring into 2004, performing their 1990 release ''[[Frizzle Fry]]'' as their second set, as documented on the DVD ''[[Hallucino-Genetics]]: Live 2004''.\n\nOn October 17, 2006, Primus released both their first greatest hits album, ''[[They Can't All Be Zingers]]'', and their third DVD, ''[[Blame It on The Fish (DVD)|Blame It on the Fish]]'', subtitled ''An Abstract Look at the 2003 Primus Tour De Fromage.'' The band toured in 2006 on their Primus: The Beat a Dead Horse Tour 2006, and played at a small number of festivals in 2008.\n\nIn 2010, Alexander, who had left the band for the second time due to lack of interest, was replaced by Jay Lane, who had not played with the band since 1988.  The band subsequently resumed touring after the free ''[[June 2010 Rehearsal]]'' was released later that year, and a studio album, ''[[Green Naugahyde]]'', was released in 2011.\n\nIn 2013, Lane left Primus for the second time to focus on his other band [[RatDog]], who were coming off hiatus at the time, and was replaced again by Alexander.  Primus' eighth studio album, ''[[Primus & the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble]]'', a re-imagining of the [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory#Track listing|soundtrack]] from the 1971 film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]'', was released in October 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Primus released ''[[The Desaturating Seven]]'', an album that is based on a bedtime story published by Italian author [[Ul de Rico]], which is about a group of rainbow eating goblins. They then began a tour with ''[[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]'' through most of 2018.\n\n=== Solo work ===\n\n==== Sausage ====\n\nIn 1988 Claypool started a short-lived alternative/funk rock band featuring [[Todd Huth]] on guitar and [[Jay Lane]] on drums. The group released their first album in April 1994 \"Riddles Are Abound Tonight\" by [[Prawn Song Records]], and did a few short tours and opened for groups such as [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], [[Rollins Band]], and [[Slayer]]. The band reunited for a show on December 31, 2019, opening for [[The Claypool Lennon Delirium]] and have not returned since.\n\n==== Holy Mackerel ====\n\nIn 1996, Claypool produced, engineered and released a solo album, \"Les Claypool and the Holy Mackerel presents\" ''[[Highball with the Devil]]''. Claypool is credited with bass, drums and vocals on several tracks as well as guitar. Also on the album are [[M.I.R.V.|Mark \"Mirv\" Haggard]], [[Adam Gates]], [[Jay Lane]], Joe Gore, [[Charlie Hunter]] and [[Henry Rollins]]. The accompanying tour included Haggard and Gates on guitars with [[Bryan Mantia]] on drums. It was announced during the Holy Mackerel tour that Mantia had been chosen to become the next Primus drummer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n==== Oysterhead ====\n\n{{Main|Oysterhead}}\nIn April 2000, Claypool collaborated with [[Trey Anastasio]] (of [[Phish]]) and [[Stewart Copeland]] (of [[the Police]]) to form a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called [[Oysterhead]]. Claypool and Anastasio had been looking for an opportunity to collaborate. Each had a mutual interest in playing with Copeland who had been a rock idol of their teen years. Plus, Claypool and Copeland already had an established friendship. Oysterhead were originally intended as a one time performance during [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival|Jazz Fest]] in [[New Orleans]]. Though timid of the band's sudden and surprising popularity they eventually decided to record and tour.<ref name=\"frogs&oysters\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/859/FROGS-and-OYSTERS-A-LES-CLAYPOOL-INTERVIEW|title=FROGS-and-OYSTERS-A-LES-CLAYPOOL-INTERVIEW|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022065910/http://www.jambase.com/Articles/859/FROGS-and-OYSTERS-A-LES-CLAYPOOL-INTERVIEW|archive-date=October 22, 2015|date=January 26, 2001|access-date=December 25, 2017|author=Mike Powers|publisher=jambase.com}}</ref> They released one studio album, ''[[The Grand Pecking Order]]'', and toured before disbanding in 2001. They re-united in 2006, at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]. In 2016 Les tried to reunite the group, but ended up releasing an album with [[The Claypool Lennon Delirium]]. Fortunately, they re-united once again in 2020 for two shows at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, with the rest of their tour cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n==== The Frog Brigade ====\n{{Main|Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade}}\n[[File:LesClaypool.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Claypool at [[Bonnaroo]] on July 21, 2002]]\nIn May 2000, Claypool formed [[Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade]], an experimental rock group.  Claypool was asked to put together a band for the Mountain Aire Festival in [[Angels Camp, California]]. The band \"of the most incredible guys (he) could possibly find\" debuted that Memorial Day weekend and played a number of other festivals including [[moe.#moe.down|moe.down]].<ref name=\"frogs&oysters\" /> Originally he was going to call the band \"Les Claypool's Thunder Brigade\". Claypool states:\n\n<blockquote>I originally was going to do the two drummer thing with [[Tim Alexander|Herb]] and [[Jack Irons]], so I was gonna call it the Les Claypool Thunder Brigade. Michael Bailey from [[Bill Graham Presents]] said to me that it may sound a bit too heavy for the Mountain Aire crowd and to perhaps try something a little different that had to do with the event itself. Since it was home of the Calaveras County Frog Jump... hence the Frog Brigade and then it evolved into Colonel Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade.<ref name=\"frogs&oysters\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Primus hiatus allowed him to return to his musical roots, playing songs by bands such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], and [[the Beatles]]. Claypool has called the Frog Brigade his \"[[mid-life crisis]] band\". From a set of October shows recorded at [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco, Claypool released two Frog Brigade live albums, one being a cover of [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[Animals (Pink Floyd album)|Animals]]''. The line-up included [[Todd Huth]], Eenor, [[Jeff Chimenti]], [[Jay Lane]], [[Skerik]] and Claypool.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe Frog Brigade is also noted for Claypool's being accepted into the [[jam band]] scene.<ref>''Jambands'', Dean Budnick, Backbeat Books, 2003, pp 248\u20139</ref> ''[[Live Frogs Set 1]]'' won \"Best Live Album\" at the second annual [[Jammys]]. Jay Lane and Jeff Chimenti are both members of [[Bob Weir]]'s band [[Ratdog]]. Claypool performed with the Rat Brigade when opening for Ratdog once in 2000 and again in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.toasterland.com/setlists/browse.php?band=100|title=Toasterland|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> The Rat Brigade includes Claypool, drummer Lane and keyboardist Chimenti, with guest appearances by saxophonist Kenny Brooks and Bob Weir.\nClaypool also guested on the Ratdog sets in 2000, 2006 and 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ratdog.org/stuff/guests|title=Bob Weir & RatDog Guest Musicians, Stats, and Other Stuff|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Claypool released a studio album of the Frog Brigade, ''[[Purple Onion (album)|Purple Onion]]''. Musicians on multiple tracks for ''Purple Onion'' include Warren Haynes (Gov't Mule) Eenor, [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Mike Dillon]], [[Skerik]], [[Jay Lane]], Ben Barnes and Sam Bass (Dillon and Skerik were both from [[Critters Buggin]] while Barnes and Sam Bass were from [[Deadweight (U.S. band)|Deadweight]]). This album includes \"Whamola\" which later appeared as a remix for the theme of [[South Park]] [[List of South Park episodes#Season 10: 2006|Season 10]].\n\n==== C2B3 ====\n{{Main|Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains}}\nAlso in 2002, Claypool collaborated with guitarist [[Buckethead]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]]/[[Talking Heads]] keyboardist [[Bernie Worrell]], and former [[Primus (band)|Primus]] drummer [[Bryan Mantia]] under the name [[Colonel Claypool's Bucket of Bernie Brains]] (stylized \"C2B3,\" which is to be pronounced as \"C Squared, B Cubed\"). Their concerts pushed the improvisational envelope by preparing no material and not rehearsing beforehand. At one of their shows they prepared sandwiches onstage for the audience to eat.\n\nC2B3 re-united in 2004 to record ''[[The Big Eyeball in the Sky]]'', an album with equal parts instrumental and vocal songs. The band began an 18-state [https://web.archive.org/web/20040825214022/http://www.c2b3.com/tour/ tour] of the US on September 24, 2004.

She also opened on every show (sometimes to scathingly negative reviews) during the 2004 tour as a solo act, and sometimes with members of C2B3. Claypool also produced and performed on Gabby La La's first album, ''[[Be Careful What You Wish For...]]''. Gabby La La is the first artist Les has signed to his label since [[Charlie Hunter]] in 1993. He has performed select shows with her (including the 2005 [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]) and added her to his then new touring band, [[Les Claypool's Fancy Band|Les Claypool & His Fancy Band]]. The 2005 Fancy Band line-up also included [[Skerik]], [[Mike Dillon (musician)|Dillon]] and [[Jay Lane|Lane]].\n\nAt the end of 2005, Claypool released ''[[5 Gallons of Diesel]]'', a video retrospective of all of his work away from Primus.\n\n==== 2006 ====\n\n===== ''Electric Apricot'' =====\n{{Main|Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo}}\nClaypool's first attempt at a feature-length film, ''[[Electric Apricot: Quest For Festeroo]]'', was shown on various film festivals in the late spring of 2006. The movie is a spoof of the jam band scene centered on the fake band, Electric Apricot, in the mockumentary tradition of ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.<ref name=\"jambasearticle\">[http://www.jambase.com/Articles/Story.aspx?StoryID=8945&pagenum=0 \"Les Claypool: The Art of Falling\"]. ''JamBase''. 2006. Retrieved February 2, 2008.</ref> The group performed low-key shows in the California area (most recently [[High Sierra Music Festival]]) for the filming of the movie. The members of the band are characterized as Steve Hampton \"Aiwass\" Trouzdale (Adam Gates) on bass and vocals, Steve \"Gordo\" Gordon (Brian Kehoe) on guitar and vocals, Herschal Tambor Brillstien (Jonathan Korty) on keyboards and vocals, and of course Lapland \"Lapdog\" Miclovik (Les Claypool) on drums and vocals. The film debuted on March 15. During a question and answer session at the Tiburon Film Festival where the film debuted Claypool said that the yet unreleased DVD would have an accompanying soundtrack CD.  The film has won other awards as well including Best Feature (audience choice) at the [[Malibu, California#Arts and culture|Malibu Film Festival]].  Claypool also said that the band would possibly perform a few select shows, but a tour is unlikely as Adam Gates has a job at [[Pixar]] which makes touring difficult.  Other cameos in the film include [[Arj Barker]], [[Dian Bachar]], [[Seth Green]], [[Warren Haynes]], [[Mike Gordon]], [[Matt Stone]], [[Sam Maccarone]] and [[Bob Weir]].\n\n===== ''Of Whales and Woe'' and the Fancy Band =====\n{{Main|Of Whales and Woe|Les Claypool's Fancy Band}}\nOn May 30, 2006, Claypool released a solo album, ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]'', with guest appearances by Skerik, Mike Dillon and Gabby La La. This album includes the song \"Robot Chicken\", which is the theme song of the popular [[Adult Swim]] [[Robot Chicken|show of the same name]]. His son Cage and his daughter Lena even make a special appearance on the song \"Back Off Turkey\". The release was followed by a tour of the U.S. with the following lineup:\n\n*Les Claypool \u2013 Bass Guitar, Upright Bass, Bassjo, vocals\n*Skerik \u2013 Tenor Saxophone\n*Mike Dillon \u2013 Vibraphone, Percussion\n*Gabby La La \u2013 Sitar, Theremin\n*[[Paulo Baldi]] \u2013 Drums\n\nThis lineup is called [[Les Claypool's Fancy Band]] and did national tours in both 2006 and 2007. A live DVD, ''[[Fancy (DVD)|Fancy]]'', recorded from the 2006 tour was released in 2007. The audio track includes a mix of both soundboard and [[Bootleg recording#Authorized live bootlegs|taper recordings]].  A song from the album, \"One Better\", was used in [[National Lampoon's TV: The Movie]] in a fight scene between [[Preston Lacy]] and [[Lee Majors]].\n\n===== ''South of the Pumphouse'' =====\n{{Main|South of the Pumphouse}}\nClaypool's first book, ''[[South of the Pumphouse]]'', was released on July 1, 2006, by [[Akashic Books]]. Copies of the book were sold during Claypool's 2006 tour of the U.S. following the release of ''[[Of Whales and Woe]]''. The book is a dark, clever tale of brothers, murder, drugs, and fishing, and it has been likened to the work of [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. Claypool gave his first interview about the book on May 11, 2006.<ref>[https://archive.today/20061119205807/http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/author/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002501410 \"Primus Rocker Turns His Screenplay into a Novel: A Talk with Les Claypool\"]</ref>\n\n==== 2007\u20132016 ====\nBesides touring in the Summer of 2007 nationally with the Fancy Band, Claypool performed that October with a version of the band, dubbed the Fancy Trio. The trio consisted of Claypool, Skerik on saxophone, and Mike Dillon on drums, vibraphone and percussion. They played at The Echo Project, an inaugural ecologically minded 3-day festival in [[Fairburn, Georgia|Fairburn]], Georgia on the Boukeart family farm. The set was similar to that of the Fancy Band's tours, culling from Claypool' solo and Frog Brigade albums, as well containing a cover of \"[[One Step Beyond (song)|One Step Beyond]]\" by [[Madness (band)|Madness]] and teases of other songs, including several Primus tunes, throughout their improvisational jams.\n\nFor many years Claypool has done a New Year's Eve show at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco. More recently the New Year's Eve show has been an Annual New Year's Eve Hatter's Ball featuring a hat contest.
