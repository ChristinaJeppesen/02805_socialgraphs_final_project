Kennedy|his assassination]] near the end of his third year in office. Kennedy was the youngest person to assume the presidency by [[United States presidential election|election]]. He was also the youngest president at the end of his tenure.<ref>{{cite web| title=John F. Kennedy| url=https://www.whitehousehistory.org/bios/john-kennedy| website=whitehousehistory.org| publisher=White House Historical Association| location=Washington, D.C.| access-date=May 1, 2022}}</ref> Kennedy served at the height of the [[Cold War]], and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who represented [[Massachusetts]] in both houses of the [[U.S. Congress]] prior to his presidency.\n\nBorn into the prominent [[Kennedy family]] in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], Kennedy graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1940 before joining the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] the following year. During [[World War II]], he commanded a series of [[PT boat]]s in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]]. Kennedy's survival of the sinking of [[PT-109]] and rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero for which he earned the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]], but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented [[Massachusetts's 11th congressional district|a working-class Boston district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] and served as the junior [[List of United States senators from Massachusetts|senator for Massachusetts]] from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', which won a [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize]]. In the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]], he narrowly defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent [[Richard Nixon]], who was the incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. Kennedy's humor, charm, and youth in addition to his father's money and contacts were great assets in [[John F. Kennedy 1960 presidential campaign|his campaign]]. Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after [[1960 United States presidential election#Debates|the first televised presidential debates]] in American history. He was the first [[Catholic]] elected president.\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with [[communist state]]s in the [[Cold War]]. As a result, he increased the number of [[Military advisor#US advisors in Vietnam|American military advisers]] in [[South Vietnam]]. The [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of [[Fidel Castro]] in the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].<ref>de Quesada, Alejandro ''The Bay of Pigs: Cuba 1961'' (2011) p. 17</ref> In November 1961, he authorized the [[Operation Mongoose]], also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected [[Operation Northwoods]] in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.<ref name=\"eu.usatoday.com\">{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/30/u-s-planned-261-000-troop-invasion-force-cuba-newly-released-documents-show/813376001/ |title=U.S. planned massive Cuba invasion force, the kidnapping of Cuban officials |work=USA Today |date=October 30, 2017 |access-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref> The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|nuclear weapons treaty]] in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the [[Peace Corps]], [[Alliance for Progress]] with Latin America, and the continuation of the [[Apollo program]] with the goal of [[We choose to go to the Moon|landing a man on the Moon]] before 1970. He also supported the [[civil rights movement]] but was only somewhat successful in passing his [[New Frontier]] domestic policies.\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F.  Kennedy|assassinated]] in [[Dallas]]. His vice president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson|assumed the presidency]] upon Kennedy's death. [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], a former [[U.S. Marine]], was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by [[Jack Ruby]] two days later. The [[FBI]] and the [[Warren Commission]] both concluded Oswald had acted alone. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Revenue Act of 1964]]. Despite his truncated presidency, Kennedy ranks highly in [[polls of U.S. presidents]] with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and [[extramarital affair]]s.

Their most notorious stunt was exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the next chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain \"muckers\" who would \"spit in our sea\".

Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. Many Americans held [[Anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholic attitudes]], but Kennedy's vocal support of the [[separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]] helped defuse the situation. His religion also helped him win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], [[Adlai Stevenson II]], and Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]].{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=38\u201345}}\n\nKennedy's presidential campaign was a family affair, funded by his father and with his younger brother Robert, acting as his campaign manager. John preferred Ivy League policy advisors, but unlike his father, he enjoyed the give and take of Massachusetts politics and built a largely Irish team of campaigners, headed by [[Larry O'Brien]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]]. Kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=38\u201345}}\n\nWhen Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. Stevenson\u2014the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee\u2014remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. Kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former president [[Harry S. Truman]], who was concerned about Kennedy's lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to Johnson or someone else, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.{{sfn|Brinkley|2012|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nKennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader [[Walter Reuther]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114201919/http://time.com/3491219/behind-the-picture-jfk-and-rfk-los-angeles-july-1960/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 14, 2014|title=Head to Head: JFK and RFK, Los Angeles, July 1960|last=Cosgrave|first=Ben|date=May 24, 2014|website=Time Magazine|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref> and other liberal supporters when he [[Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection, 1960|chose Johnson]] as his vice presidential nominee.

He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \"We can learn our jobs together\", he stated.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=23, 25}}\n\nMuch to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the [[House Rules Committee]] in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=56}} Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering deeper meanings.

Kennedy administration}}\n[[File:US President John Kennedy Presidential Trips.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Foreign trips of Kennedy during his presidency]]\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the [[Cold War]]. In 1961 he anxiously anticipated a summit with [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the [[Vienna summit]] of June 1961.{{sfn|Kempe|2011|pp=76\u201378}}\n\nOn the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet French President [[Charles de Gaulle]], who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as \"the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris\".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=145}}\n\n[[File:President Kennedy in Vienna, 1961, USIA.ogv|thumb|right|Clip of Kennedy meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in [[Vienna]], 1961]]\nOn June 4, 1961, Kennedy met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and [[East Berlin]]. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in [[West Berlin]] would be regarded as an act of war.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=161\u2013171}} Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=175}}\n\nIn the weeks immediately following the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people [[Republikflucht|fled from East Berlin]] to the western sector, reacting to statements from the U.S.S.R. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=185}} In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|3.25|1961|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=201}}\n\nA month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the [[Berlin Wall]], around the city. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from the West to West Berlin continued. This course was altered when West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson and [[Lucius D. Clay]], along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through East Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.{{sfn|Daum|2008|pages=51\u201355}}{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=213}}\n\nKennedy gave a speech at [[Saint Anselm College]] on May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War.

Led by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, the plan was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=233, 238}}<ref>Gleijeses (1995), pp. 9\u201319</ref> led by CIA paramilitary officers.

The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=345}}\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to [[nuclear war]] with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=245}}\n\nMore than a third of [[U.S. National Security Council]] (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of \"[[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] in reverse\".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=387}} There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed [[PGM-19 Jupiter]] missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=388}} In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22, he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=389}}\n\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The [[Organization of American States]] gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=390}} United Nations (UN) Secretary General [[U Thant]] requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=403}}\n\nOne Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=426}} The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with [[UGM-27 Polaris]] missiles.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|pp=184\u2013186}}\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.{{sfn|Kenney|2000|p=189}} The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility.

Kennedy reacted, asking, \"Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?\" Kennedy was unaware that both men were so much at odds that they did not speak to each other on the return flight.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=595}}\n\nIn October 1963, Kennedy appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] to a Vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of the [[McNamara Taylor mission]] \"emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam\".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=602}} In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=609}} Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, [[Nguyen Ngoc Tho]] (choice of many to succeed Diem), who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=610}} At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered to be a \"strategic fantasy\".{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=613}}\n\nIn late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese General [[Duong Van Minh]] (also known as \"Big Minh\"), wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=617}} On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by \"Big Minh\", [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|overthrew the Diem government]], arresting [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|and then killing Diem and Nhu]]. Kennedy was shocked by the deaths.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=650}}\n\nNews of the coup led to renewed confidence initially\u2014both in America and in South Vietnam\u2014that the war might be won.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=651}} [[McGeorge Bundy]] drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy told [[Michael Forrestal]] that \"after the first of the year&nbsp;...

Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a \"special relationship\" (as he described it to [[Golda Meir]]) between the US and Israel.<ref>{{cite book | title=Balancing Act: US Foreign Policy and the Arab-Israeli Conflict | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | author=Shannon, Vaughn P. | year=2003 | location=Aldershot | page=55 | isbn=978-0-7546-3591-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kennedy-Golda Meir.jpg|thumb|upright|Kennedy with Israeli Foreign Minister [[Golda Meir]], December 27, 1962]]\n\nKennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first US president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry (the [[MIM-23 Hawk]]) as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies, which were opposed by Arab neighbors; those policies included Israel's water project on the [[Jordan River]].<ref>Walt, Stephen M.

''The Origins of Alliances'', Cornell University Press, pp. 95\u201396</ref>\n\nAs a result of this newly created security alliance, Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in [[Dimona]], which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government, [[David Ben-Gurion]] stated in a speech to the Israeli [[Knesset]] on December 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear plant at [[Beersheba]] was for \"research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna\".{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}} When Ben-Gurion met with Kennedy in New York, he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes \"for the time being\".{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=201}}\n\nIn 1963 the Kennedy administration was engaged in a now-declassified diplomatic standoff with the leaders of Israel.<ref name=\"Haaretz2019\">{{Cite news | url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-a-standoff-with-the-u-s-almost-blew-up-israel-s-nuclear-program-1.7193419 |title = How a Standoff with the U.S. Almost Blew up Israel's Nuclear Program|newspaper = Haaretz|date = May 3, 2019|last1 = Cohen|first1 = Avner}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2019-05-02/battle-letters-1963-john-f-kennedy-david-ben-gurion-levi-eshkol-us-inspections-dimona | title=The Battle of the Letters, 1963: John F.

The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) inspections. In 1962 the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attach\u00e9 at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}}\n\nAccording to [[Seymour Hersh]], the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans.

He reported that Israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968\u20131969.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=203}} On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of State [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] told President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program.{{sfn|Salt|2008|p=202}} Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) into contracts for the supply of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.{{sfn|Salt|2008|pp=201\u2013205}}\n\nIsraeli national interests to an extent were also at odds with Kennedy's endorsement of the United Nation's Johnson Plan, which devised a plan to return a small percentage of displaced Palestinians from the war of 1948 into what was by then, Israel. This continuation of the late UN Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskjold]]'s plan for Palestinian repatriation particularity disturbed persons who had a hard line view of even Arab resettlement in Israel, or the more heavily feared, full repatriation. The Johnson plan was spearheaded by the Palestine Conciliation Commission's Dr. Joseph Ersey Johnson, while the United Nations attempted to oversee progression from writing - into action.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/president-kennedy-discussion-of-johnson-plan-august-1962|title=President Kennedy Discussion of Johnson Plan (August 1962)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://kennedysandking.com/john-f-kennedy-articles/nasser-kennedy-the-middle-east-and-israel|title=Kennedys and King - Nasser, Kennedy, the Middle East, and Israel}}</ref>\n\n====Iraq====\n{{Main|Foreign policy of the John F.

The United Kingdom\u2014which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was dependent on Kuwaiti oil\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to [[Bahrain]], and the UK, at the urging of the Kennedy administration, brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong [[Arab League]] force, which acted as a barrier against the Iraqi threat.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=36}}\n\nIn December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the partially American-controlled [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC)'s [[concessionary holding]] to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed were connected. Senior National Security Council adviser [[Robert Komer]] worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might \"grab Kuwait\" (thus achieving a \"stranglehold\" on Middle Eastern oil production) or \"throw himself into Russian arms\". Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel\".{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=37, 40\u201342}}\n\nIn April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, Kennedy instructed the CIA\u2014under the direction of [[Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.]]\u2014to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=43\u201345}}\n\nThe anti-imperialist and anti-communist [[Iraqi Ba'ath Party]] [[Ramadan Revolution|overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup]] on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate that there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking a suitable replacement for Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=45, 57\u201358}} The Kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for Iraq.{{sfn|Gibson|2015|pp=60\u201361, 80}}\n\n====Ireland====\n[[File:President's Trip to Europe- Motorcade in Dublin.

In response, the United States conducted tests five days later.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=227}} Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=229}} Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the U.S.S.R. perceived itself to be at parity.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=243}}\n\nIn July 1963, Kennedy sent [[W. Averell Harriman]] to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=542}} The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to [[Andrei Gromyko]]. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=548}}\n\nUltimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground.

Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|N.A.A.C.P.]] and Martin Luther King's [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC).{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580\u2013584}}\n\nTo ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and Kennedy personally edited speeches that were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00&nbsp;pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=580\u2013584}}\n\nNevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later on Sunday, September 15, [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|a bomb exploded]] at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=599\u2013600}} Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.{{sfn|Reeves|1993|pp=628\u2013631}} Gaining Republican support, Senator [[Everett Dirksen]] promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|Senate filibuster]].{{sfn|Brauer 2002|p=492}} The legislation was enacted by Kennedy's successor President Lyndon B.

These ailments compelled him to spend a considerable amount of time in bed (or at least indoors) convalescing.

According to Travell's records, during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. Travell kept a \"Medicine Administration Record\", cataloging Kennedy's medications: \"injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and [[Tuinal]] to help him sleep.\"<ref name = \"Dallek\"/>\n\n===Family incidents===\n{{Main|Kennedy curse}}\nKennedy's older brother [[Joseph P.
