In 1988, she purchased an 164-acre property including main and guest residences, orchard, and stables in [[Rolling Prairie, Indiana]] as her weekend refuge. In 1992, she purchased an 80-acre compound in [[Telluride, Colorado]], which she would go on to sell in approximately late 2000. In 1994, she also purchased an apartment at the [[Four Seasons Hotel Chicago]]. Between 1996 and 2000 she purchased a total of five condos in different development areas of [[Fisher Island, Florida]]. In 2000, through her Chicago-based LLC ''Overground Railroad'', Oprah purchased her friend [[Gayle King]] an estate in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. In 2001, Oprah sold all five of her Fisher Island condos and purchased what would become her \"main home base\" she has also called \"The Promised Land\" (where she currently lives as of 2022), a (then) 42-acre (17-ha) estate with ocean and mountain views in [[Montecito, California]]. \n\nAdditionally that year, she also purchased homes in both [[Elmwood Park, Illinois]] and [[Merrillville, Indiana]] for other family members and friends. Similarly, in 2002, she purchased her father's home in [[Franklin, Tennessee]] and a lakefront condo in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. In 2003 she listed her compound in Rolling Prairie, Indiana, and sold it in 2004. From 2003 to 2005, Oprah acquired several properties totaling 163 acres in [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula]] and [[Hana, Hawaii|Hana]], [[Hawaii]] as well as a penthouse apartment in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. In 2005, she purchased a home in [[Douglasville, Georgia]] which was gifted in 2011 to a family member.\n\nIn 2006, Oprah purchased a co-op apartment along [[Lake Shore Drive]] in downtown Chicago, reportedly with plans to permanently move there from her prior adjoined-condo unit in Water Tower Place for the duration of her show but for reasons unknown, the property sat entirely unused until she sold it in 2012. In 2008, she sold her penthouse apartment in Atlanta. That year, she also listed [[Gayle King]]'s estate and purchased her (through her second LLC ''Sophie's Penthouse'') a penthouse apartment in midtown [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] which would later be sold in 2012.\n\nIn early 2014, she listed her combined-unit Chicago duplex on the market. Later that year, Oprah came back to [[Telluride, Colorado]] to purchase a 60-acre lot with plans to build on the property. A lawsuit filed against her that year by a retired nuclear physicist living in the area regarding trail access rights was dismissed later that year with the judge citing little case law to support his case, among other issues. The extent of the agreement between all the parties and jurisdictions regarding her subsequent development on the property remains undisclosed.\n\nIn 2015, Oprah purchased another property in Telluride, and later that year, expanded her Montecito compound with another 23-acre estate and yet another 44-acre dedicated crop and equestrian preserve. That year she also sold both of her downtown Chicago homes.\n\nIn 2018, Oprah obtained two adjoining parcels of land totaling 23 acres including the Madroneagle compound on [[Orcas Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and sold her last home property in the Chicago area from Elmwood Park. In late 2019, Oprah yet again expanded her Montecito home-base compound, this time to 70 contiguous acres, with the purchase of a four-acre complex from actor [[Jeff Bridges]]. In 2021, she sold her Orcas Island compound as she said she was too busy to use it and purchased another compound in Montecito further away from her home-base compound, flipping the latter in 2022 with split properties, one of which was sold to her property manager and longtime personal trainer Bob Greene, and the other to actress [[Jennifer Aniston]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/oprah-winfrey-impressive-real-estate-portfolio/|title=She Gets a House!

According to CBS journalist George Mair, Taylor was Winfrey's \"first intense, to die for love affair\". Winfrey helped get Taylor a job at WVOL, and according to Mair, \"did everything to keep him, including literally begging him on her knees to stay with her\".<ref name=\"Mair pg 33\">Mair (1999) p. 33</ref> Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976. \"We really did care for each other,\" Winfrey would later recall. \"We shared a deep love. A love I will never forget.\"<ref name=\"Mair pg 43\">Mair (1999), p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Winfrey had a romantic relationship with [[John Tesh]].

I wasn't living with him. I'd never lived with anyone\u2014and I thought I was worthless without him. The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him. I felt depleted, powerless. At the end, I was down on the floor on my knees groveling and pleading with him\".<ref name=\"Mair pg 49\"/> Winfrey became so depressed that on September 8, 1981, she wrote a suicide note to best friend [[Gayle King]] instructing King to water her plants.<ref name=\"Mair pg 49\">Mair (1999), p. 49.</ref> \"That suicide note had been much overplayed\" Winfrey told ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine. \"I couldn't kill myself. I would be afraid the minute I did it, something really good would happen and I'd miss it.\"<ref Name=\"Mair p50\">Mair (1999), p. 50.</ref>\n\nAccording to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: \"The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much. I needed everyone to like me, because I didn't like myself much. So I'd end up with these cruel self-absorbed guys who'd tell me how selfish I was, and I'd say 'Oh thank you, you're so right' and be grateful to them. Because I had no sense that I deserved anything else. Which is also why I gained so much weight later on. It was the perfect way of cushioning myself against the world's disapproval.\"<ref Name=\"Mair p50\"/>\n\nWinfrey later confessed to smoking [[crack cocaine]] with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era.
