[[Don Hewitt]], executive producer of ''60 Minutes'', allowed her to work part-time for two seasons so she could care for her child. After that, it was arranged that she would work full-time. But after two years, she became pregnant again and asked to continue the part-time arrangement. Hewitt declined her request, firing her, and deciding instead to hire someone who would work full-time. Her departure from the show garnered headlines, as a national debate started to take place about whether women could balance both family and career. She turned down opportunities to co-host CBS's ''[[The Early Show]]'' and ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' in the mid-1990s when her children were young.\n\nVieira discusses her family and career
