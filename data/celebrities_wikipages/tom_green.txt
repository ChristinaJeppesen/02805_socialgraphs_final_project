The 1990 show, originally a rap music show entitled ''The Rap Show'', was followed by an electronic music show hosted by [[Glenn Humplik]]. Tom and Glenn became friends and joined forces to host ''The Midnight Caller Show'', which lasted from 1993 to 1996. The basic format of The Midnight Caller was to have listeners call-in with Tom and Glenn making fun of them (or \"razzing\" them) and soon after hanging-up on them.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} In the early 1990s, Green had a short-lived career as a rapper in a group called [[Organized Rhyme]] under the alias \"[[MC Bones]]\". His fellow MCs included \"Pin the Chameleon\". The single \"Check The O.R.\" was nominated  for a [[Juno Award]] in [[Juno Awards of 1993#Best Rap Recording|1993 for Best Rap Recording]] and won the [[MuchVibe Best Rap Video (MMVA Award)|MuchVibe Best Rap Video]] award in 1992.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McDonnell|first=John|date=May 21, 2010|title=Rhymes against music: when actors try to rap|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/may/21/rhymes-against-music-actors-rap|access-date=November 23, 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In 1998, he released ''[[Not The Green Tom Show]]'' as MC Face.\n\n==== ''The Tom Green Show'' ====\n{{Main|The Tom Green Show}}\nGreen soon had his own non-paid television show on [[public-access television]] on [[cable TV]]. The first incarnation of ''The Tom Green Show'' aired from September 1994 until 1996 as a one-hour no commercial public cable access program on [[Rogers Television]] 22 in the [[Ottawa]] region. It had 50 episodes in two seasons.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawacomedy.com/fusionbb/custompb/green.php|title=Tom Green Timeline|publisher=ottawacomedy.com|access-date=May 2, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100424051157/http://www.ottawacomedy.com/fusionbb/custompb/green.php|archive-date=April 24, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''The Tom Green Show'' was a [[variety show]] format, where he would have guests visit the studio and bands play before a live audience. \n\nIn 1996 he was hired by the [[CBC Television|CBC]] to do reports from the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Summer Olympic games]]... including during the road trip in his sweltering un-airconditioned [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler K car]]. Tom Green ingeniously solved the air conditioning problem having the roof of the car sawed off --  turning it into a permanent \u201cconvertible.\u201d \u00a0 \n\nThese [[CBC Television|CBC]] feature reports gave him national exposure (in both Canada and the US) with his [[Jackass (franchise)|Jackass]] type pranks, antics and humor.\n\nIn October 1996, ''The Tom Green Show'' aired one time as a pilot on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]. The show was later picked up in Canada by [[The Comedy Network]] in 1997 and aired 26 episodes over the course of two seasons.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\" />\n\n=== Rise to mainstream (1999\u20132003) ===\n\n==== MTV and ''The Tom Green Show'' ====\n{{Main|The Tom Green Show}}\n''The Tom Green Show'' was then picked up by [[MTV]] in January 1999, where he gained popularity in the United States and worldwide. The format of the MTV version of the show was similar to his original show; it was hosted by Green and co-hosted by two of his long-time friends, Glenn Humplik, who occupied the couch, and Phil Giroux, who sat behind a window at the back of the set and became known as \"the guy in the window\" usually drinking cups of coffee. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted at his parents, both of whom appear to be unimpressed and embarrassed by their son's antics.<ref name=\"tgtimeline\" />\n\n''The Tom Green Show'' frequently employed [[shock humor]]. Some of Green's most notable skits include pretending to \"hump\" a dead [[moose]] (which was referenced by rapper [[Eminem]] in \"[[The Real Slim Shady]]\"), having an [[X-rated]] lesbian scene  painted on his father's car (labeled the \"Slut Mobile\"), drinking milk by sucking on a cow's teat, and putting a cow head in his parents' bed while they slept because his father was a fan of ''[[The Godfather]]'' films. Green also hung his own unauthorized piece of art in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] (which remained untouched for days) with the added twist of later coming back and vandalizing it to the horror of onlooking patrons.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://entertainmentcentralpittsburgh.com/nightlife/tom-green/|title= Tom Green: Entertainment Renaissance Man|author=Rick Handler  |publisher= Entertainment Central|date = November 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a segment, Green went to the press conference of ''[[Grey Owl (film)|Grey Owl]]'' where he serenaded and kissed [[Pierce Brosnan]]. Brosnan, thinking Green was a [[journalist]], advised him not to give up his day job. Green also did many segments humiliating his co-host and longtime friend Glenn Humplik; even after the pair had become well-known, Humplik continued working at his phone company job, fearing that his entertainment career might not last. Green teased him about this often and once gave out Humplik's office phone number on the air.\n\nGreen eventually wrote a song called \"[[Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)]]\", which he composed during MTV's Spring Break while doing a show on a cruise ship. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on ''[[Total Request Live]]'' and was also referred to in Eminem's song \"The Real Slim Shady\". He quickly called for the video to be retired because \"it's not fair to [[98 Degrees]].\" Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured him to do so in order to maintain the image that ''Total Request Live'' was, in fact, a live request show (the next week's episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of \"The Bum Bum Song\" at the time).\n\nGreen's increasing fame made it harder for him to ambush people during [[Vox populi|man-on-the-street]] segments, leading him to target mostly [[old age|senior citizens]] and non-[[English language|English]] speakers. After he was diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]] in March 2000, he stopped production of new episodes of his TV show but continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. Green's popularity during this time led to him gracing the cover of the June 8, 2000, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=June 1, 2011|title=Comedy Stars on the Cover of RS|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/a-history-of-comedy-stars-on-the-cover-of-rolling-stone-50717/|access-date=November 28, 2020|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe MTV show ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' debuted six months after ''The Tom Green Show'' went on hiatus.

Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists, and there is no evidence to suggest that such an event occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/tomgreen.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Tom Green Hitler Bar Mitzvah |publisher=Snopes.com |access-date=October 24, 2008}}</ref> He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, ''[[Hollywood Causes Cancer]]'', stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name \"Tom Green.\" Green says, \"I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that \u2013 it's both abhorrent and not funny. To this day I still get asked about it, and it's annoying. So again, for the record, it didn't happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it won't, because it doesn't exist. I've never put on a Hitler costume. In fact, I've never even been to a Bar Mitzvah.\"\n\n==== Film career ====\nGreen's fame soon netted him roles in several Hollywood movies, including ''[[Road Trip (film)|Road Trip]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'' (which he also wrote and directed), and ''[[Stealing Harvard]].'' Green continued the trend of his brand of comedy in ''Road Trip'' in a notable scene where he put a mouse in his mouth.\n\n''Freddy Got Fingered'' won in five categories at the [[2001 Golden Raspberry Awards]], given to the worst movies of the year.

Green and Barrymore met after Barrymore, who was a fan of Green's show, asked Green to appear in ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'', which Barrymore starred in and produced.

The most notable incident came on November 18, 2000, when Green hosted the American television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. During the [[monologue]], Green brought Barrymore on stage and teased the audience about the couple marrying at the end of the episode. Ultimately, the stage was set for a wedding before Barrymore, in the end, got \"cold feet\" and left Green alone to end the show. The SNL incident initially left viewers and the media confused about whether the couple had actually planned to marry on live TV, or were simply staging a publicity stunt. Eventually, Green also went on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' to toy with the public once again, this time claiming that his bride might be [[pregnancy|pregnant]].{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nBarrymore and Green filed for [[divorce]] on December 17, 2001, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].<ref name=\"divorce\">{{cite web|first=Jeanne|last=Darst|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,623114,00.html|title=Tom Green Files for a Divorce from Drew|access-date=September 7, 2008|date=December 18, 2001|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005070527/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,623114,00.html|archive-date=October 5, 2008}}</ref> Their divorce became official on October 15, 2002.<ref name=\"divorce\" />\n\n==== Return to MTV and ''The New Tom Green Show'' ====\nIn 2002, Green starred in and directed a one-hour MTV special called ''The Tom Green Subway Monkey Hour'', where he tormented strangers in [[Japan]].

Green was a recurring contributor to ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''; doing many segments where he travels across America looking for \"interesting people\", typically bringing the most colourful person with him back to the studio. In these segments, the focus is more on the odd behavior of the interviewees, with Green generally playing the straight man.\n\n[[File:Tom Green and the Carpet Frogs Perform in Afghanistan 110308-A-UJ825-165.jpg|thumb|Green performing with the [[USO]] in Afghanistan, 2011]]\nIn 2003, Green visited troops in [[Kosovo]] on a [[USO]] tour.

The first show aired live on June 15, 2006, at 11&nbsp;pm EST, was originally called ''[[Tom Green Live!]]'', and was airing Mondays through Thursdays. In January 2008, shortly after Green's split from ManiaTV, the show was renamed ''[[Tom Green's House Tonight]]''. The shows are broadcast live at TomGreen.com. A pared-down version was later broadcast on [[The Comedy Network]] and various local channels in the United States, until Green stopped syndicating the show to television. On a 2009 blog, Green noted that he stopped his show from syndication on television due to dissatisfaction with his lack of creative control. He continues to broadcast the show from his website. Green later started a monthly subscription service that allowed subscribers to have full access to all the videos on his website.\n\nDue to lack of an established term, Green often refers to his live streaming broadcast as \"Web-o-Vision.\" He also jokingly says he is broadcasting to \"The National Internet\", despite the show having a worldwide audience. Green often refers to his show as, \"The highest rated, longest running, and only talk show on the Internet.\"\n\nFrom Green's website, ''Tom Green's House Tonight'' typically aired live on weeknights at 10&nbsp;pm EST, although shows can begin at any time during the day and night. The shows were then archived on his website. The format of the show often includes Green taking live telephone calls and [[Skype]] video calls where viewers around the world are able to chat with Green and his guests. Green would often be a victim of [[prank call]]s due to the live nature of the show and would sometimes voice his frustration with the callers. On top of the live web show, Green has added many video segments from his past as well as present.\n\nIn 2007, \"Tom Green Live\" won the 2007 TV Guide \"Online Video Award\" for Best Web Talk Show. In 2008, ''Tom Green's House Tonight'' won a 2007 [[Webby Award]] for \"Best Variety Show\".<ref name=\"webby\">{{cite web|url=http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=12#film_variety_vid|title=2007 Webby Award Winners|publisher=webbyawards.com|access-date=December 18, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020213400/http://www.webbyawards.com/webbys/current.php?media_id=97&season=12#film_variety_vid|archive-date=October 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Green 2006 (141261244) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Green in 2006|upright]]\n\nAs host of the show, Green often plays the straight man while interviewing guests.

The longest standard format show, in which Green interviewed [[Steve-O]], ran for 3.5 hours and ended with Green drunk and Steve-O heavily [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]].\n\nWhen Green does not have guests, he has done many unconventional shows such as playing the saxophone for an hour, having a week dedicated to performing [[karaoke]], or updating the viewers about ''The Channel'' while taking telephone and Skype calls.\n\nOn his website, Green has talked about the substantial costs of continuing the online show and that ''The Channel'' may be gone in mid-2011 if it is not profitable by then. In 2011, Green ended the subscription service on his website and stated that his live show is on hiatus. Green also took down the TV studio that was in his living room.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Green brought back his web-o-vision show and hosts it daily from his studio in Burbank.\n\n=== Tom Green Live at The SModcastle (2010) ===\nFrom October \u2013 December 2010, Green did seven weekly podcasts interviewing guests at [[Kevin Smith]]'s [[Smodcastle#SModcastle|SModcastle]].
