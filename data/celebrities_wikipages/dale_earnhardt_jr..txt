His first race car was a 1979 Monte Carlo that he co-owned with Kerry. By age 19, after two seasons of driving Street Stock Division, Earnhardt Jr. had honed his driving abilities to the point of joining the Late Model Stock Car Division. He competed on the North and South Carolina short tracks driving a No. 3 Buick. While he did run various tracks during this time, Earnhardt Jr. primarily focused his efforts at the [[Myrtle Beach Speedway]] in South Carolina and the East Carolina Motor Speedway in [[Robersonville, North Carolina]], where he captured the pole for the Greenville Merchants 300 on October 28, 1994. There, he developed an in-depth knowledge of chassis setup and car preparation, while racing against his siblings. He worked at his father's dealership as a mechanic while he went to [[Mitchell Community College]] to earn an [[associate degree]] in [[Auto mechanic|automotive technology]].<ref>James MacDonald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3bpQ6yDZof4C&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=earnhardt+mitchell+community+college#v=onepage&q=earnhardt%20mitchell%20community%20college Dale Earnhardt Jr.: Racing's Living Legacy], 2008, pages 34-35</ref>\n\nEarnhardt Jr. ran nine [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Busch Series]] races between 1996 and 1997 for [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]], and [[Ed Whitaker]], respectively, before driving for his father's team in the Busch Series full-time in 1998, in which he started the season with an amazing blow over after contact with [[Dick Trickle]] and [[Buckshot Jones]] at Daytona, on the same weekend that his father had [[1998 Daytona 500|his first and only Daytona 500 win]]. Earnhardt won consecutive NASCAR Busch Series Championships in 1998 and 1999 barely edging [[Matt Kenseth]]. In 1998, he made his first start in the [[Winston Cup Series]], at the exhibition race held at the [[Twin Ring Motegi]] in [[Japan]]. Also in 1999, he drove in five Winston Cup races in the No. 8 [[Budweiser]]-sponsored Chevrolet for DEI in preparation for a full-time Cup Series ride in 2000, with his best finish being a tenth-place finish at Richmond in the fall race.<ref name=NascarDriverBio>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/headline/cup/dale.earnhardt.bio/index.html |title=Dale Earnhardt Jr. Drive Bio on Nascar.com |publisher=Nascar.com |date=February 20, 2011 |access-date=May 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000409/http://www.nascar.com/news/headline/cup/dale.earnhardt.bio/index.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===2000===\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr car.jpg|thumb|left|Earnhardt (far right) racing alongside [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]] and [[Jerry Nadeau]] (left) at the 2000 [[Coca-Cola 600]]]]\n\nThe 2000 season was Earnhardt's breakout year in the Winston Cup Series. He competed for the Raybestos [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year]] Award in 2000. His primary competitor for the award was [[Matt Kenseth]]. Kenseth outran Earnhardt in the season-opening [[Daytona 500]]. Earnhardt scored his first win in the DirecTV 500 at [[Texas Motor Speedway]], breaking the record held by his father Earnhardt Sr. for fewest starts by a driver to earn his first victory in NASCAR's \"modern era\" by winning in his 12th start, and also at [[Richmond International Raceway]]. He became the first rookie to win [[2000 The Winston|The Winston]].\n\nEarnhardt played a part in recreating one Winston Cup milestone in 2000 when he competed with his father and half-brother Kerry in the [[Pepsi 400]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]]. That occasion was only the second time that a father had raced against two sons&nbsp;\u2013 [[Lee Petty]] and his two sons [[Richard Petty|Richard]] and [[Maurice Petty|Maurice]] had previously accomplished the feat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerryearnhardtonline.com/subs/kerry.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002003547/http://www.kerryearnhardtonline.com/subs/kerry.html|url-status=dead|title=Kerry Earnhardt website|archive-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nEarnhardt ended the 2000 season with two wins, three Top 5's, five Top 10's, and two poles.\n\n===2001===\n{{one source|section|date=June 2015}}\nIn 2001, the major event of the season occurred on February 18, in the final corner of the final lap of the [[2001 Daytona 500]]. As Earnhardt Jr. and his teammate [[Michael Waltrip]] raced to the finish line, he finished second to Waltrip. His father had crashed in turn 4 after [[Sterling Marlin]] made contact with his left rear bumper. Earnhardt Sr. shot up the track into the outside wall behind Waltrip and his son and collected [[Ken Schrader]] in the process. Earnhardt Sr. was pronounced [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|dead]] at 5:16&nbsp;pm due to a [[basilar skull fracture]].\n\nIn the aftermath, many disgruntled fans sent death threats to Marlin and his family, blaming him for the crash; Earnhardt Jr. and Waltrip both requested that fans stopped blaming anybody for Earnhardt Sr.'s death and both the local police and NASCAR investigations into the crash cleared Marlin of any involvement. Earnhardt Jr. raced at [[North Carolina Speedway|Rockingham]] the following weekend, but finished in 43rd-place after a wreck on the first lap that looked eerily similar to his father's wreck just a week earlier.\n\nReturning to Daytona for the [[2001 Pepsi 400|Pepsi 400]], Earnhardt Jr. made a comeback and had the dominant car of the race, leading 115 out of 160 laps. On the last restart, he managed to make a move from sixth to first place in the span of two laps, with Waltrip holding off the field as Earnhardt Jr. took the checkered flag. He won the [[2001 MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400|MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400]] at [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]], which was the first Winston Cup Series race following the [[September 11 attacks]] as the original scheduled race at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]] was postponed until the end of the season. After the race, he performed a [[Polish victory lap]] while holding a large American flag out the driver's side window.\n\nIn October, Earnhardt Jr. took his second restrictor plate win as he won the [[Good Sam Club 500|EA Sports 500]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], for which he also scored a Winston No Bull 5 $1 million bonus. He was docked 25 points, however, after his car failed post-race inspection. With this win, DEI swept three of the four restrictor plate races for 2001, only failing to win the spring Talladega race. He finished the 2001 season eighth in the points standings with three wins, nine Top 5's, 15 Top 10's, and two poles.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASCAR Sprint Cup Standings 2001|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2001/data/standings_official.html|publisher=NASCAR.com|access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u201303===\n[[File:Daleearnhardtjr.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt at the Pepsi 400 in 2002]]\n\nIn 2002, Earnhardt Jr. had a roller-coaster season. He struggled after enduring a [[concussion]] from a head-on collision to the outside wall at the [[2002 NAPA Auto Parts 500|California]] race in April&nbsp;\u2013 an injury he did not admit to until mid-September. In the three races following California, he finished no better than 30th. However, Earnhardt Jr. rallied to sweep both [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] races (leading a dominating 133 of 188 laps in the spring race), a pair of Bud Pole Awards and an 11th-place finish in the points standings with 11 Top 5's and 16 Top 10's.\n\nIn 2003, Earnhardt Jr. became a true title contender, scoring a record-breaking fourth consecutive win at Talladega, after being involved in a 27-car crash on lap 4. He struggled for most of the race, and was at points a half-lap down, only catching back up to the pack through a caution. The win was controversial because with five laps to go, it appeared that Earnhardt went below the yellow line to gain position, but NASCAR ruled that [[Matt Kenseth]] had forced him below the line, making it a clean pass.\n\nHe later scored a victory at [[Can-Am 500|Phoenix]] in October, recording a career best third-place effort in the point standings, with 13 Top 5's and 21 Top 10's. He also took home the NMPA Most Popular Driver award for the first time in his career.<ref name=NascarDriverBio />\n\n===2004\u201306===\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr car2006.jpg|thumb|left|Earnhardt in the pits at the spring 2006 Bristol race]]\n\nIn 2004, Earnhardt won the [[2004 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], six years to the day after his father won his only title in the Great American Race (and 3 years after his father was killed in the [[2001 Daytona 500|2001 race]]). Earnhardt came very close to sweeping Speedweeks, as in addition to the Daytona 500, he also won his Gatorade Duel and the Busch Series race. However, he finished 2nd in the [[Budweiser Shootout]] to [[Dale Jarrett]].\n\nOn July 18, during the summer off-weekend, Earnhardt crashed a [[Chevrolet Corvette C5-R]] during a practice for the [[American Le Mans Series]] [[2004 Grand Prix of Sonoma|Grand Prix of Sonoma]] at [[Infineon Raceway]]. The car slid off course and hit a concrete barrier during warm-up the day of the race, rupturing a fuel line and causing the car to burst into flames with him still inside. He suffered second and third degree burns on his neck, chin, and legs partially due to not wearing a protective [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]] with his helmet. The burns prevented him from finishing two races where he was relieved by [[Martin Truex Jr.]] (at New Hampshire) and his DEI teammate [[John Andretti]] (at Pocono) in the middle of the races. In the fall, Earnhardt became the first driver to sweep a weekend at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] by winning both the Busch and Nextel Cup races in the same weekend.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr and team in the winners circle photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Earnhardt and his team in victory lane]]\nEarnhardt was able to qualify for the NASCAR 10-race playoff, and had his 5th NEXTEL Cup win of the season (a career high) at Talladega. However, he was penalized 25 points for use of an obscenity during the television broadcast, in violation of a new NASCAR rule prohibiting participants from using obscene language<ref>{{cite web|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.espn.com/racing/news/story?id=1895384|title=Post-Talladega expletive costs Earnhardt|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=October 6, 2004|access-date=December 15, 2021}}</ref> (the rule had been created the week after the Daytona 500, in the wake of the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|Super Bowl half-time show controversy]]). That incident, combined with two consecutive DNF's in the Chase, eventually dropped him out of the running, and he finished fifth in the 2004 NEXTEL Cup Chase despite a career-high 6 wins at Daytona, Atlanta, Richmond, Bristol, Talladega and defending his fall win at Phoenix (though under the non-Chase points system, Earnhardt would have tied his third-place points finish of the previous year). He closed off the 2004 season with 6 wins, sixteen Top 5s, and twenty-one Top 10 finishes. He also picked up his 2nd consecutive Most Popular Driver Award.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nAt the close of the 2004 season, it was revealed that Tony Eury Sr. would be promoted to the team manager position for the DEI corporation, while [[Tony Eury Jr.]] became the crew chief for [[Michael Waltrip]] for the 2005 season. Peter Rondeau, a Chance 2 employee who also helped Earnhardt win the Busch Series race at Bristol in August, became the crew chief for Earnhardt in 2005. Rondeau served as Earnhardt's crew chief until the [[Coca-Cola 600]] weekend, when he was replaced with DEI chief engineer Steve Hmiel, who helped Earnhardt score his lone win of 2005 at Chicagoland in July, when he took the lead from [[Matt Kenseth]] on the last cycle of pit stops. Earnhardt was eliminated from any possible competition for the [[NEXTEL Cup]] championship after suffering an engine failure at the [[California Speedway]]. Earnhardt was reunited with his cousin, Tony Eury Jr., after the fall Richmond weekend, and results improved immediately. Earnhardt finished the season 19th in points. For the 3rd straight year, he took home the NMPA Most Popular Driver Award.\n\n[[File:dalejrmerchandisehauler.JPG|thumb|right|An Earnhardt merchandise hauler]]\nEarnhardt's proficiency as a car owner continued. His race team outside of DEI, [[JR Motorsports]], in 2005 fielded a car in the USAR Hooters ProCup Series, winning once and qualifying for the Four Champions playoff. Mark McFarland moved to the Busch Series in 2006, driving the No. 88 JR Motorsports US Navy Chevrolet, with Richard Childress Racing providing assistance; however, he was fired before the fall Michigan race, the [[Carfax 250]]. He was replaced by [[Robby Gordon]] and [[Martin Truex Jr.]] for the rest of the year. Long-time short track racer Shane Huffman drove Earnhardt's USAR Hooters ProCup car in 2006. In 2006, during the spring weekend at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], Earnhardt and other DEI drivers drove with special black [[livery|paint schemes]] on their cars, reminiscent of his late father's famous No. 3 paint scheme. On [[Father's Day (United States)|Father's Day]] in 2006, he drove a vintage Budweiser car at Michigan International Speedway to honor both his grandfather ([[Ralph Earnhardt]]) and his father, who at one point in both their careers used the No. 8 car. After rain caused the race to be ended early, Earnhardt finished 3rd with [[Kasey Kahne]] winning the race. After 17 races in the 2006 season, Earnhardt sat 3rd in the championship standings with 1 win, coming at Richmond in May 2006.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nDuring the race at New Hampshire, he experienced the second engine failure of his 2006 season, ultimately leading to a 43rd-place finish. Following New Hampshire was the race at Pocono, where he was running in the middle of the pack when he crashed in turn 2. These two events catapulted him to 11th in the points standing, out of the Chase for the Cup. At [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], Earnhardt and his crew made a critical decision to stay out on the final pit stop to get a much needed Top 10 finish to move him up to 10th in the points. He made the [[2006 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]] after finishing 17th in the [[Chevy Rock and Roll 400]] at [[Richmond International Raceway]] on September 9, 2006. He came close to winning at Talladega, and was leading on the last lap when [[Brian Vickers]] made contact with Earnhardt's future teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]], sending Johnson into Earnhardt and spinning both of them out.

However multiple misfortunes, including a missed pit stop and a 1-lap penalty for pitting outside of his pit box, sent him far into the back of the running order. Earnhardt was then directly involved in a controversial crash on lap 124, when, while fighting to return to the lead lap, he came in contact with [[Brian Vickers]] while fighting to be the first driver one lap down (who gets a free pass should the caution flag come out), causing a 10-car pileup which included [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Scott Speed]], [[Jimmie Johnson]], [[Kyle Busch|Kyle]] and [[Kurt Busch]], [[Robby Gordon]], [[Jamie McMurray]], and [[Carl Edwards]]. Vickers and Kyle Busch later criticized Earnhardt, who denied purposely clipping Vickers. Earnhardt criticized Vickers for blocking him on the inside. The race concluded early due to the rain and Earnhardt officially finished 27th. He later apologized for his actions but maintained that he never intended to wreck Vickers.\n\nAfter a blown engine at California and falling to 35th in owners' points, he finished 10th at Las Vegas and reached 29th place in points. He finished 8th at Martinsville. He had a string of poor finishes including 20th at Texas, and 31st at Phoenix after being spun out by [[Casey Mears]]. He gained confidence in his team with a very strong performance at Talladega, leading for 20 laps, and finishing second to his protege [[Brad Keselowski]] after Keselowski sent Edwards flying into the catch fence.

At the [[2012 Quicken Loans 400]] at Michigan, Earnhardt dominated the race, leading 95 laps, and won, snapping a 143-race winless streak, almost four years to the day after his last win on June 15, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/junior-ends-skid-wins-at-michigan |title=Junior ends skid, wins at Michigan |date=June 17, 2012 |work=[[Fox Sports]] |agency=Associated Press |access-date=December 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618165440/http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/dale-earnhardt-jr-ends-drought-with-win-in-Michigan |archive-date=June 18, 2012 }}</ref> Earnhardt would suffer a 23rd-place finish at Sonoma after being wrecked in a green-white-checkered finish, but was still able to cross the finish line intact and on the lead lap, continuing his streak of being the only driver to finish all races on the lead lap. He would back this up with a fourth-place finish in the [[Quaker State 400]] at Kentucky Speedway.\n\nThe following week at Daytona, a last lap crash resulted in a 15th-place finish for Earnhardt but still kept his streak of being the only driver to finish every single lap in every race. Earnhardt backed up with a couple of Top 5 finishes, finishing 4th at both Loudon and Indianapolis, where he gained the points lead for the first time since 2004, after points leader [[Matt Kenseth]] was taken out in a late race crash.  Back at Pocono, Earnhardt was running in the 2nd position, but a break in the transmission sent the 88 to the garage, but he came back out 18 laps down and finished 32nd, due to rain that came and ended the race and a late race wreck involving Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth, and Denny Hamlin. His streak of completing on the lead lap came to an end, but he still maintained the points lead with 5 races until the chase cutoff. At Watkins Glen, Earnhardt had a steady Top 10 going in the final laps but a late race spin resulted in a 28th-place finish, this would drop the 88 team from 1st to 4th in the points.\n\nReturning to Michigan for the [[2012 Pure Michigan 400|Pure Michigan 400]], Earnhardt had to start in 42nd place after a crash in practice forced him to move to a backup car. He led for a number of laps mid-race and finished on the lead lap in 4th place. Earnhardt, [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] and [[Kasey Kahne]] also escaped engine difficulties that plagued [[Jimmie Johnson]], [[Jeff Gordon]], and [[Tony Stewart]]. At [[Bristol Motor Speedway]], Earnhardt started 16th after a qualifying rainout; he led 13 laps in the race before pit road penalties resulted in a 12th-place finish. The finish locked him into the 2012 Chase for the Sprint Cup, alongside Greg Biffle, and teammate Jimmie Johnson. At Atlanta Motor Speedway, Earnhardt went a lap down early but recovered to earn a 7th-place finish. The following week at Richmond International Raceway, Earnhardt earned his first pole of the season. He would go on to lead 69 laps, but a late race pit stop resulted in the 88 team getting a 14th-place finish, and being seeded 7th in the standings. In the first race of the chase at Chicagoland Speedway, Earnhardt finished 8th despite having to start at the rear of the field due to an engine change. Finishes of 13th and 11th at Loudon and Dover left the 88 team 7th in the standings.\n\n====Concussion====\nOn the morning of October 11, 2012, Hendrick Motorsports announced that Earnhardt would have to sit out the [[Bank of America 500]] at Charlotte and the [[Hollywood Casino 400]] at Kansas due to a concussion from a 25-car crash on the last lap at Talladega on October 7, 2012. That weekend, Earnhardt finished 20th at Talladega when he took a hard lick in a crash after making contact with [[Bobby Labonte]]. Prior to this, Earnhardt had suffered a concussion during an August 29 test at [[Kansas Speedway]]. [[Regan Smith (racing driver)|Regan Smith]] was announced to replace him at those two races.<ref name=concussion>{{cite news|title=Dale Jr. Has Concussion, Out 2 Races|url=https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nascar/dale-jr-has-concussion-out-2-races |access-date=October 11, 2012 |newspaper=Fox Sports |date=October 11, 2012 |agency=Associated Press |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011171344/http://msn.foxsports.com/nascar/story/Dale-Earnhardt-Jr-has-concussion-out-2-races |archive-date=October 11, 2012 }}</ref> Prior to the concussion, Earnhardt had competed in 461 consecutive races, dating back to the 1999 Atlanta event. The 2012 Bank of America 500 marked the first race since the [[1979 Southern 500]] that an Earnhardt had not competed in the Sprint Cup Series as [[Dale Earnhardt]] had competed in every race from that one up until his death in the [[2001 Daytona 500]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dale Earnhardt Sr. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Statistics|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver?id=earnhda01|access-date=October 21, 2012|author=Racing-Reference.Info}}</ref> On October 23, 2012, Earnhardt was cleared for the Tums Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville after missing two races.

At Phoenix, Earnhardt fought an ill-handling car, and finished 21st. At the season finale, at Homestead-Miami Speedway, Earnhardt would finish 10th. This was his first top 10 finish at the 1.5-mile track, and his 20th of the season. He closed the season 12th in the final standings. On November 29, 2012, it was announced that Earnhardt won the NMPA Most Popular Driver Award for the 10th consecutive year. This tied Bill Elliott's streak of 10 consecutive wins in the award.\n\n===2013===\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet Texas April 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Earnhardt during practice for the [[2013 NRA 500]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway]]]]\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt, Jr., 2013 STP Gas Booster 500 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt on pit road during the [[2013 STP Gas Booster 500]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]]]]\nEarnhardt started the 2013 season with an 8th-place finish in the rechristened [[Sprint Unlimited]]. He qualified 11th for the Budweiser Duel, but he blew an engine in practice, he was forced to drop to the rear of the field. After narrowly missing a 3-car wreck between [[Carl Edwards]], [[Trevor Bayne]], and [[Regan Smith (racing driver)|Regan Smith]], he finished 9th. He finished fourth at the [[DRIVE4COPD 300]] after submarining under [[Alex Bowman]]'s car in a violent last lap wreck.\n\nIn the Sprint Cup Series, Earnhardt hit a slight resurgence, and in the first five races of the season recorded three Top 5s and five Top 10 finishes. It began with a second-place finish to teammate [[Jimmie Johnson]] at the [[2013 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], Earnhardt's third runner up finish in the 500 since 2010. The following week at Phoenix, he led for 47 laps, but was shuffled back in traffic during a cycle caution flag pit stops, which allowed [[Carl Edwards]] to assume the lead while Junior finished in fifth place. This was followed by two more Top 10 finishes: 7th at Las Vegas and 6th at Bristol. At Fontana, Earnhardt started mid-pack and after a couple of mistakes including a lengthy pit stop caused by missed lug nuts on a right rear tire, he came home in 2nd-place finish, assuming the points lead as a result of [[Brad Keselowski]] going off pace and falling back. Two weeks later in Martinsville, Earnhardt struggled throughout the race, and spun out after [[Danica Patrick]] was hit by [[Brian Vickers]] and sent into Earnhardt and ended up finishing 24th, 2 laps down, losing the points lead to Jimmie Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/04/07/earnhardt-loses-spot-atop-standings.html|title=Earnhardt loses spot atop standings|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=April 7, 2013|access-date=April 11, 2013|archive-date=April 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412015021/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/04/07/earnhardt-loses-spot-atop-standings.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt Texas, Earnhardt ran near the front until lap 187, when his battery alternator quit and he ended up finishing 29th. At Kansas, he ran near the front until a debris caution happened while he, [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]], and [[Carl Edwards]] were all on pit road. Earnhardt would go a lap down, take the wave-around, and finish 16th. At Richmond, he finished 10th. At Talladega, he went a lap down early after some banging with [[Travis Kvapil]]. However, with a caution for a crash on lap 43, Earnhardt got the free pass to get back on the lead lap. He made his way back up through the field to the Top 5, but slipped back to 17th at the end.\n\nThe following week at Darlington, Earnhardt raced inside the Top 10 much of the night before settling for a 9th-place finish. He was one of only a few cars who were able to avoid being put a lap down by [[Kyle Busch]].\n\nThe following week in the Sprint All-Star Race, Earnhardt battled a tight handling car much of that night before finishing 7th. The following week for the Coca-Cola 600, Earnhardt lost an engine and finished 39th, giving him his first DNF since 2011. The next two weeks saw a rebound, with finishes of 10th at Dover and 3rd at Pocono. At the Quicken Loans 400, Earnhardt led 23 laps but suffered an engine failure, and finished 37th in what was the lowest point of the season for the Hendrick Motorsports teams as a whole ([[Kasey Kahne]] and [[Jeff Gordon]] both had DNFs due to crashes, and [[Jimmie Johnson]] cut a tire with 5 laps to go).<ref>{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/16/jimmie-johnson-michigan-results-quicken-loans-400.html|title=Trouble snares Hendrick quartet at Michigan|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=June 16, 2013|access-date=June 16, 2013|archive-date=June 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620153523/http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/16/jimmie-johnson-michigan-results-quicken-loans-400.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the low of Michigan, Earnhardt had a 12th-place finish at Sonoma.\n\nAt Kentucky, Earnhardt won the pole and set a new track qualifying speed record with lap time of 29.406 seconds and a speed of {{convert|183.636 |mph}}.<ref name=\"lineup\">{{cite web | url=http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/Statistics/Season-Stats/Statistics.aspx?SubSeriesID=1&YearID=42&RaceID=6045&StatType=Qualifying | title=2013 Quaker State 400 Qualifying Results | publisher=Motor Racing Network | access-date=June 28, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704101243/http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/Statistics/Season-Stats/Statistics.aspx?SubSeriesID=1&YearID=42&RaceID=6045&StatType=Qualifying | archive-date=July 4, 2013 }}</ref> Though he started on the pole, he lost the lead to [[Carl Edwards]] early. However, while Earnhardt was leading after the restart from a competition caution (due to a rain delay), [[Denny Hamlin]] cut a tire and the carcass came up the track and was struck by Earnhardt's splitter and also by [[Jimmie Johnson]]'s car, causing significant damage. Earnhardt had to make several charges through the field to salvage a 12th-place finish. He then took an 8th-place finish at the Coke Zero 400. He, Johnson, and [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] were the only three drivers to sweep the Top 10 in both Daytona races.\n\nEarnhardt then battled a struggling car at New Hampshire, where he finished 14th. After the final off week, he found some consistency with finishes of 6th at Indianapolis and 5th at Pocono, while battling loose wheels and vibrations in a span of two weeks.\n\nThe No. 88 team then had two bad weeks, with a 30th-place finish at Watkins Glen due to a late race crash with [[Kasey Kahne]]. The next week, Earnhardt blew a right front tire while running in the Top 10. The damage was enough that he finished 26 laps down, in 36th place. This evaporated his Chase cushion, but with finishes of 10th at Bristol and 8th at Atlanta, he was able to rebuild this cushion. At Richmond, the last race of the regular season, Earnhardt only needed to finish 32nd or better to make the Chase. A 13th-place finish did this, and he entered the Chase seeded in ninth place. This was the first time in Earnhardt's career that he had made three straight Chase appearances. In the first Chase race at [[Chicagoland Speedway]], Earnhardt suffered an engine failure, placing him last in Chase competition. He bounced back at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], leading 17 laps and finishing 6th. The result was good enough to move Earnhardt up to 11th in Chase for the Sprint Cup standings with eight races left in the season.\n\nAt Dover, Earnhardt won his second pole of the season, setting a new qualifying speed record of 161.849&nbsp;mph. This was the first time since 2002 that he had recorded more than one pole during a season. During the race, Earnhardt would lead 80 laps, but would finish 2nd to [[Jimmie Johnson]]. The following week at Kansas, he finished 8th. Making his 500th Cup start at Charlotte, Earnhardt led 19 laps early, but finished 15th while battling a tight race car. The following week at Talladega, Earnhardt led 38 laps and was about to receive a push from [[Austin Dillon]] to overtake [[Jamie McMurray]] on the last lap when [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]] tapped Dillon, causing that driver to spin out and then get hit by [[Casey Mears]], leaving Earnhardt with a 2nd-place finish. The following week at Martinville, Earnhardt earned an 8th-place finish. The next week at Texas, he had a solid night, finishing 2nd to Johnson for the third time in the season (after Daytona and Dover). The next week at Phoenix, Earnhardt started by being forced to pit with a loose wheel early, putting him a lap down. However, a caution allowed him to use the free pass to get back on the lead lap and salvage a 4th-place finish.\n\nAt the season finale, the last 67 laps saw a tight battle for the lead between Earnhardt; [[Matt Kenseth]]; and [[Denny Hamlin]]. Hamlin won while Earnhardt finished 3rd, giving him his first Top 5 at Homestead. He finished off the season 5th in the points, with two pole positions, ten Top 5s, and a career-high 22 Top 10 finishes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/15/dale-earnhardt-jr-steve-letarte-2014-season-lameduck-success-sprint-cup-series.html|title=DON'T COUNT OUT EARNHARDT JR., LETARTE IN 2014|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 15, 2014|access-date=January 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn December 5, 2013, Earnhardt won the Most Popular Driver Award for the 11th consecutive  year, breaking [[Bill Elliott]]'s record, who scored 10 straight awards from 1991 to 2000.\n\n===2014===\n[[File:P1 PowerboatRacing 6-7-14-3293 (14183463777).jpg|thumb|left|Earnhardt's 2014 Cup Series car]]\n[[File: Earnhardt Jr.-RSR 3.9.14.JPG|thumb|Earnhardt Jr. at Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]\nThe No. 88 team made headlines even before the start of the season. During the regular Daytona Winter test in January, it was announced that crew chief Steve Letarte would step down from the pit box after the season to become a full-time member of the upcoming [[NASCAR on NBC]] broadcast team, alongside [[Jeff Burton]] and [[Rick Allen (television announcer)|Rick Allen]]. Earnhardt and Letarte reassured that this move would not interfere with them winning races and competing for the championship at the season's end. In the [[2014 Sprint Unlimited|Sprint Unlimited]], Earnhardt led for 7 laps, but in the last segment, contact with [[Marcos Ambrose]] caused him to hit the wall in turn 1, finishing 9th. In the [[2014 Budweiser Duels|first Budweiser Duel]], Earnhardt started 4th, and led 14 laps, before fading back to finish where he started.\n\nIn the [[2014 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], Earnhardt started 9th. His car hung around mid-pack for most of the first quarter of the race. After a six-hour and 22-minute red flag, Earnhardt's car came alive, taking the lead with 70 laps remaining. He led 54 of the last 70 laps and he held off [[Denny Hamlin]] and [[Brad Keselowski]] to win his second Daytona 500, just 10 years after his first one.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peltz |first=Jim |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-nascar-daytona-500-finish-20140223,0,1516398.story |title=Dale Earnhardt Jr. wins rain-delayed Daytona 500 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 23, 2014 |access-date=February 27, 2014}}</ref> The following week at Phoenix, Earnhardt continued his momentum, finishing 2nd to [[Kevin Harvick]]. At Las Vegas, Earnhardt gambled on fuel in the remaining 40 laps, but he ran out of gas while leading on the last lap, finishing 2nd to eventual race winner [[Brad Keselowski]]. At Bristol, he was strong early, and had a chance to become the first driver since [[Richard Petty]] to start a season with four straight Top 2 finishes, until tire problems forced him to make an unscheduled stop, leaving him to finish 24th, four laps down.\n\nAt Auto Club Speedway, Earnhardt started 15th. However, on lap 44, his car lost a right front tire and hit the outside wall in turn 2, bringing out a caution, making him one of several victims of tire failures that plagued the race. After being repaired and falling to the back of the lead lap, Earnhardt made several charges through the field to salvage a 12th-place finish, keeping him at 2nd place in the points. The following week at Martinsville, Earnhardt battled inside the Top 5 all day, leading 25 laps, and finished 3rd, giving him his 4th Top 3 finish of the season, and regained the points lead. At Texas, he crashed on Lap 13 and caught on fire. He finished last and fell 5 positions in points and dropped to 31 points behind new points leader [[Jeff Gordon]]. The following week at Darlington, Earnhardt raced among the Top 5 all night, and was leading on a green-white-checkered finish, before finishing 2nd to [[Kevin Harvick]].\n\nAt Richmond, after the Easter off week, Earnhardt was strong in the race, racing among the Top 3 late, and led 7 laps, but a green-white-checkered, and bad brakes forced Earnhardt to a 7th-place finish. The following week at Talladega, Earnhardt raced among the pack until the middle of the race, when he took the lead. He led for 26 laps, but the last 30 laps saw the car take a conservative pace, and was never able to regain any track position, and finished 26th. At Kansas, for the first night race at the track, Earnhardt ran solidly in the Top 5, even leading a few laps, before finishing 5th.\n\nFor the Sprint All-Star Race, Earnhardt started 6th, but battled a tight car all night, and was never a real contender. Earnhardt crossed the finish line 4th. The following week at the Coca-Cola 600, he raced inside the Top 5 for most of the night, before making an unscheduled pit stop for an engine vibration. This resulted in a 19th-place finish, only two laps down. The following week at Dover, Earnhardt raced inside the Top 10 all day, and was running in the Top 5 late, but a mistake on pit road left them with a 9th-place finish.\n\nAt Pocono, Earnhardt started eighth and stayed inside the Top 10 most of the afternoon. On the last restart, he was behind [[Brad Keselowski]]. In a reversal of the events at Las Vegas, with 5 laps to go, Keselowski tried to move behind the lap down car of [[Danica Patrick]] to get a piece of trash off his grille, which caused Earnhardt to slip by and never look back en route to his first victory at Pocono and second of the season. The win marked the first time since 2004 that he had won multiple races in a season. The next week at Michigan, Earnhardt started inside the Top 5, but finished 7th, after several cars had different pit strategies. The next week at Sonoma, saw Earnhardt have his statistical best road course finish, staying in the top ten for most of the race, and finished 3rd. The following week at Kentucky, Earnhardt finished 5th.\n\nReturning to Daytona, Earnhardt was involved in an early 16-car pileup on the front straightaway on lap 20, but was able to salvage a 14th-place finish by the time the race was called for rain after 112 of 160 laps.\n\nEarnhardt was able to bounce back the following week at New Hampshire with a 10th-place finish. With the finish, he clinched a Chase berth, with him being enough inside the Top 30 and having two victories. The following week, he finished 9th at Indianapolis.\n\nThe questions referring to the replacement of Steve Letarte were finally answered on July 30, for it was announced that Greg Ives, [[Chase Elliott]]'s Nationwide Series crew chief at [[JR Motorsports]], would return to Hendrick Motorsports, and take over Earnhardt's pit box for 2015.\n\nReturning to Pocono, Earnhardt started 9th. He ran inside the Top 10 for most of the race, and took the lead from [[Greg Biffle]] with 14 laps to go. Earnhardt had built up a lead in excess of three seconds when the caution came out for [[Kurt Busch]]'s cut tire on lap 154, erasing his lead. He then sweated out a four lap shootout on the last restart to take his 3rd win of the year, marking the first time since 2006 that a driver swept both Pocono races ([[Denny Hamlin]] was the last driver). This win tied Earnhardt with [[Jimmie Johnson]] and [[Brad Keselowski]] for most wins of the season up to that point.\n\nAt Watkins Glen, Earnhardt finished 11th, and due to [[Jeff Gordon]] struggling, assumed the points lead, for the first time since Martinsville in April. The following week at Michigan, he made contact with [[Kyle Larson]] on pit road, but through hard work from his pit crew, was able to lead four laps and salvage a 5th-place finish.\n\nThe following week at Bristol, while running 5th, leader Denny Hamlin was wrecked by Kevin Harvick while racing for the lead, which then sent Hamlin's car into the inside wall. Hamlin's car then slid right back up in front of the No. 88 and slammed into the left-side door of the car, and the contact was bad enough to send Earnhardt behind the wall, and suffer a 39th-place finish. This was his second DNF of the year, after the early exit in the spring Texas race.\n\nIn the final race of NASCAR's regular season at Richmond, Earnhardt made his debut with a Nationwide-sponsored No. 88. He raced to a 12th-place finish, after what was a long, difficult night for the team. Despite struggling at the 3/4-mile track, Earnhardt seeded third in the Chase grid, behind series leader Brad Keselowski, and tied with [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Jimmie Johnson]], and [[Joey Logano]] for 2nd place. He started the Challenger Round of the Chase with an 11th-place finish in Chicago. The following week at New Hampshire, Earnhardt finished a solid 9th-place finish, giving him a comfortable advantage to make the Contender Round after Dover. At Dover, he finished 17th to make it to the next round.\n\nAt Kansas, after a 5th-place run in the spring, Earnhardt was looking to repeat this feat to start off the contender with a solid finish to help his chances to extend his run for the championship. After leading 45 laps in the same car he used to win both Pocono races earlier in the season, a cut right front tire resulted in a 39th-place finish. That finish caused him to fall to 11th place in points, 25 points behind 8th place. He came to Charlotte needing a win or a good finish. He led early but around lap 133, his shifter broke due to a vibration (a similar problem had befallen [[Jimmie Johnson]] at Michigan in August). He had to make multiple pit stops to fix the problem and never recovered, ending up 20th. He fell to last in the Chase standings, 26 points behind 8th.\n\nAt Talladega, Earnhardt started 28th and led for 31 laps. However, a crash on the back straightaway when he was turned by [[Greg Biffle]] ended his title contention chances and left him with a 31st-place finish.\n\nDespite being knocked out of the Chase, Earnhardt continued to be consistent. At Martinsville, he led 79 laps and was leading with ten laps to go when a caution came out for a wreck between [[Kyle Larson]] and [[Marcos Ambrose]]. On the resulting restart, Earnhardt was running 5th. During the restart, he slipped through the pack and overtook [[Tony Stewart]] for the lead in turn 4. He continued to hold the lead to win the race ahead of [[Jeff Gordon]]. It was Earnhardt's first career win at Martinsville.\n\nReturning to Texas, Earnhardt had a rather average run, starting 12th and finishing 6th. At Phoenix, he had a solid day and got another Top 10, finishing 8th. At Homestead, Earnhardt had a tire problem early. He got the free pass and managed to crack the Top 5 at one point but fell back late to finish 14th. He finished 8th in the final standings with what was the best season for Earnhardt since 2004 with 4 wins, 12 Top 5s, 20 Top 10s, and an average finish of 12.2. For the 12th straight year, Earnhardt won the NMPA Most Popular Driver Award.\n\n===2015===\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2015}}\nAt the end of the 2014, Earnhardt Jr.'s crew chief [[Steve Letarte]] departed Hendrick Motorsports to join [[NASCAR on NBC]]'s broadcasting team. Letarte was replaced by [[Chase Elliott]]'s 2014 Xfinity crew chief Greg Ives. Due to National Guard dropping their motorsports sponsorships, Earnhardt Jr. also got a new sponsor in the form of [[Nationwide Insurance]].\n\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt Jr. takes the lead in the Daytona 500.jpg|thumb|left|Earnhardt racing alongside [[Joey Logano]] on lap 115 of the [[2015 Daytona 500]].]]\nEarnhardt Jr. kicked off 2015 with a ninth-place finish in the Sprint Unlimited. On February 19, he won the first Budweiser Duel in what was his fourth triumph in the Budweiser Duels. In the Daytona 500, he led for over 30 laps but on one of the last restarts, he made a move that mired him in the middle without help, and fell back to 16th with 15 laps to go, but managed to make his way back to third place by the last lap. This was his fifth Top 3 finish in the Daytona 500 in six years, after his runner-up finishes in 2010, 2012, and 2013, and his win in 2014.\n\nAt Atlanta, Earnhardt Jr. came home with another third-place finish and at Las Vegas, he finished fourth, scoring his third Top 5 finish after taking two tires during green flag pit-stops with 30 laps to go. At Phoenix, he had his worst finish of the year, with a last place finish after a tire-blowout. At Auto Club, he finished 6th. At Martinsville, he also ran inside the Top 20 until a tire-blowout made him get involved in a massive pileup that destroyed the front end of his car. Because of this crash, he would go on to finish 36th. At Texas, he narrowly was beaten by [[Kevin Harvick]] for second place. At Bristol, he ran as high as third until a loose wheel put him down two laps down. Although he never got them back, he was able to bring home a 16th-place finish only two laps down. At Richmond, he ran in the Top 10 all day until he and [[Tony Stewart]] made contact but managed to finish 14th.\n\nAt Talladega, Earnhardt Jr. started in row 2. He stayed near the front of the pack for most of the day, taking the lead with 27 laps to go and sailing away to his sixth win at the track and his first since October 2004, tying him with teammate [[Jeff Gordon]] for most wins among active drivers at Talladega. At Kansas, he finished third after staying out on the last caution. At Charlotte, he gambled on fuel and barely beat out [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Martin Truex Jr.]] for another third-place finish. Earnhardt led three laps at Dover but a penalty for speeding on pit road cost him, although he was able to finish 14th two laps down.\n\nAt Pocono, Earnhardt ran in the top ten all day. On a late restart, he and [[Brad Keselowski]] cut their tires from incidental contact and a caution flew seconds later when Keselowski hit the wall after making contact with [[Brett Moffitt]]. Earnhardt Jr. pitted and restarted 29th with 20 laps to go and salvaged an 11th-place finish. Earnhardt finished second in the rain-shortened Michigan race after he could not pass Kurt Busch on the last restart before the race was called for rain on lap 138. Earnhardt also had another solid Top 10 run at Sonoma, finishing 7th.\n\nReturning to Daytona, Earnhardt Jr. won the pole for the [[2015 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400]] after qualifying was rained out and the starting lineup was set by opening practice times. In the race itself, after enduring a rain delay, he took the lead early on lap 8, and after leading 97 laps, held off multiple charges from [[Jimmie Johnson]] and [[Denny Hamlin]] in the closing laps to take his second win of the year. The win itself, however, was overshadowed by the last lap crash that saw [[Austin Dillon]]'s car fly into the catch fence. Earnhardt Jr. also became only the 23rd driver in NASCAR Sprint Cup history to lead over 8,000 laps. He achieved this milestone, when he led 97 laps. This brought his career total laps led count to 8,051.\n\nAt Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. struggled with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 halfway through the race. Later, on lap 206, he would be the subject of controversy when he rear-ended [[Danica Patrick]] and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying  \"I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight.\"<ref name=\"Dale Earnhardt Jr. perplexed after contact with Danica Patrick at Kentucky\" >{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/07/12/dale-earnhardt-jr-danica-patrick-kentucky-contact/30041219/|title=Dale Earnhardt Jr. perplexed after contact with Danica Patrick at Kentucky|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|publisher=Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc.|date=July 12, 2015|website=usatoday.com|access-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:5 Hour Energy DSC 0130 (19898142271).jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt Jr. racing at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in 2015]]\nAt New Hampshire, Earnhardt Jr. started 19th and finished 5th.\n\nAt Indianapolis, Earnhardt Jr. was running well until lap 147, when he got forced into the grass in turn 1 and spun out. He was able to salvage a 22nd-place finish.\n\nReturning to Pocono, Earnhardt Jr. was involved in a spin on a restart on lap 72 that also involved [[Kurt Busch]]. His car did not take severe damage, however, and despite running mid-pack for most of the second half of the race and running 17th with four laps to go, he ended up finishing in fourth place after many other drivers including the leaders at four laps to go ran out of fuel.\n\nAt Watkins Glen, Earnhardt was able to start 7th and finished 11th after running in the top 10 all day, but running out of fuel on the last lap.\n\nReturning to Michigan, Earnhardt Jr. started inside the top 10 and was running in the top 3 in the early part of the race. After battling an ill-handling racecar, he was able to finish 10th.\n\nEarnhardt returned to Bristol looking for his first win at that track since 2004. He qualified 26th and after the first caution came out he would pit. During the pit stop the crew would leave a wheel loose and Earnhardt would pit again. After going a lap down multiple times in the race, he got the Lucky Dog and got back on the lead lap. After moving up to the top 5 later on in the race, he would settle for a 9th-place finish.\n\nThe series would take an off week and return to Darlington. Again Earnhardt would have to start mid-pack. He would run outside the top 10 most of the day, but the crew would make right adjustments and they would finish 8th.\n\nThe regular season finale would take place at Richmond for the 26th race. Earnhardt would qualify 29th and was puzzled in his interview afterwards. During the race, Earnhardt made steady climbs and by halfway had cracked the top ten. Earnhardt would climb as high as 4th and end up finishing 5th. He made the chase for the 8th time in his career and was seeded 6th for the first Chase race.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. opened the Challenger Round with a 12th-place finish at Chicagoland. At New Hampshire, he ran up front for most of the day, but an emergency fuel stop with two laps to go led him to finish 25th, two laps down, and at the bottom of the Chase cutline. At Dover, despite falling back at a few points, Earnhardt Jr. was locked in a battle with [[Jamie McMurray]] for control of the final transfer spot into the Contender Round. He almost did not make it into the next round, with his chances being saved thanks to a caution for [[Brett Moffitt]]'s crash on lap 357 keeping him from having to make a green flag pit stop to replace a loose wheel. On the last restart, Earnhardt Jr. overtook McMurray on the outside, and finished third, clinching the final transfer spot and bumping McMurray out of the Chase.\n\nAt Charlotte, Earnhardt Jr was battling for a position inside the top 10 when he made contact [[Carl Edwards]] and hit the wall ending up 29th. At Kansas, Earnhardt Jr had to pit for a loose wheel under green and ended up finishing 21st, 2 laps down. Heading into Talladega, he basically needed to win to advance. He led 61 laps, but he slid his tires coming onto pit road and ended up having to take 2 tires instead of fuel only while others were taking fuel only. He ended up on the front row, heading into the only GWC. But a wreck behind him ended up cutting it short and he ended up 2nd upon a review, eliminating him from the championship. At Martinsville, the week after he was eliminated from Chase Contention, he was strong all race taking home a 4th-place finish at the track.   At Texas the following week Earnhardt recovered from an early spin to finish 6th. Earnhardt Jr. managed to get his 3rd victory of the season at Phoenix, after the race was called for rain. At the season finale at Homestead Earnhardt crashed early in the race, winding up 40th. For the 13th consecutive year, Earnhardt won the NMPA Most Popular Driver Award.\n\n===2016===\n[[File:Dale Earnhardt, Jr. - Sarah Stierch 04.jpg|thumb|right|Earnhardt Jr. at the [[2015 Toyota/Save Mart 350]] ]]\nEarnhardt started the 2016 season with a crash in the Sprint Unlimited on lap 23 when [[Brian Vickers]] cut down a tire and hit him, damaging the side of his car. This would allow him to finish 15th, four laps down. He then went on to win the first [[Can-Am Duel]] race for the second year in a row. In the Daytona 500, he was strong early in the race but with 30 laps to go, he spun off of turn 4 while trying to make a move and hit the SAFER barrier head-on. He would wind up 36th. The following week in Atlanta he was very strong, finishing second.  The following week, at Las Vegas, Earnhardt had a car that was solid all day and ended with an 8th-place finish. At the spring race in Phoenix, he led for a good portion of the race  but stayed out on old tires during overtime. Because of this, he slid his tires on the start, finishing 5th. At Fontana the next week, he struggled throughout the race in the early stages, even being as low as 34th. But in overtime, he made a charge, finishing 11th. At Martinsville, he spun on lap 5, spending 300 laps one lap down. But in the end, he finished 14th and on the lead lap. In Texas, he was strong late in the race, finishing 2nd to Kyle Busch, who won back to back races. At Bristol, he stalled his car on the start, going 2 laps down. But as the race went on, his car came to life and he finished 2nd.\n\nWhen the Xfinity Series came to Richmond for the running of the Toyota Care 250, Earnhardt would finish 2nd in the first heat race. In the main feature, he would dominate and win the race holding off [[Ty Dillon]] for his first Xfinity win since 2010 and his first for JR Motorsports.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jensen |first=Tom |url=http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/dale-earnhardt-jr-richmond-international-raceway-sprint-cup-xfinity-toyota-owners-400-042316 |title=Dale Earnhardt Jr. could break out the broom at Richmond International Raceway |work=[[Foxsports.com]] |date=April 23, 2016 |access-date=April 23, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn Lap 50 at the spring Talladega race, he got loose in the draft and just like Daytona he hit the wall, damaging his car. This would result in a 40th-place finish. At Kansas, he started 22nd and finished 15th. The following week at Dover, he would start 2nd because qualifying was rained out, but was involved in a late wreck on a botched restart, finishing 32nd.\n\nIn the All-Star Race, qualifying was rained out, so he started 10th due to owner points, but was able to finish 3rd.\n\n====Concussions end season====\nIn July, Earnhardt was diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms and would miss the second half of the year as a result.

In his final career race, Earnhardt started in 24th place and finished in 25th place. He ended up in 21st in points standings. He ended up with only one Top 5, eight Top 10's, two poles, and seven DNF's. However he did win his 15th consecutive and final Most Popular Driver award.

In 2015, JR Motorsports began fielding a part-time team in the Truck Series, with [[Cole Custer]] driving the No. 00 [[Haas Automation]] Chevrolet Silverado in 10 races. Kasey Kahne also drove part-time in the Truck Series, with the two drivers winning at [[Gateway Motorsports Park]] and Charlotte, respectively.
