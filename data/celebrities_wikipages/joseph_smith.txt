By the time of his death, 14 years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present with millions of global adherents.\n\nSmith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]]. By 1817, he had moved with his family to [[Western New York]], the site of intense religious revivalism during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith said he experienced a series of visions, including [[First Vision|one in 1820]] during which he saw \"two personages\" (whom he eventually described as [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus Christ]]), and another in 1823 in which [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] directed him to a buried book of [[golden plates]] inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the ''Book of Mormon''. The same year he organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], calling it a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the [[early Christian Church]]. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\" or \"Mormons\", and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 that renamed the church as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nIn 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a [[Intentional community|communal]] American [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. They first gathered in [[Kirtland, Ohio]], and established an outpost in [[Independence, Missouri]], which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the [[Kirtland Temple]]. Because of the collapse of the church-sponsored [[Kirtland Safety Society]] Anti-Banking Company, violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians, and the [[Mormon extermination order]], Smith and his followers established a new settlement at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where he became a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, when the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' criticized Smith's power and practice of [[polygamy]], Smith and the Nauvoo city council ordered the destruction of their printing press, inflaming anti-Mormon sentiment.<ref name=\"historyOfLDS-council\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGi-iiz6juYC&pg=PA430 |title=History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |volume=VI |year=1912 |pages=430\u2013432 }}</ref> Fearing an invasion of Nauvoo, Smith rode to [[Carthage, Illinois]], to stand trial, but he was killed when [[Death of Joseph Smith|a mob stormed the jailhouse]].\n\nSmith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings discuss the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]]. Several religious denominations identify as the continuation of the church that he organized, including [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) and the [[Community of Christ]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1805\u20131827)===\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Smith}}\nSmith was born on December 23, 1805, on the border between [[South Royalton, Vermont|South Royalton]] and [[Sharon, Vermont]], to [[Lucy Mack Smith]] and her husband [[Joseph Smith Sr.]], a merchant and farmer.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=9, 30}}; {{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=1}}</ref><ref>Modern DNA testing of Smith's relatives suggests that his family were of Irish descent. {{Cite journal|last1=Perego|first1=Ugo A.|last2=Myres|first2=Natalie M.|last3=Woodward|first3=Scott R.|year=2005|title=Reconstructing the Y-Chromosome of Joseph Smith: Genealogical Applications|jstor=23289931|journal=Journal of Mormon History|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|location=Champaign, Illinois|volume=31|issue=2|pages=42\u201360}}; {{Cite news|first=Michael|last=De Groote|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700249298/DNA-shows-Joseph-Smith-was-Irish.html|title=DNA shows Joseph Smith was Irish|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|date=August 8, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2018}}; {{Cite news|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/conference/august-2008/joseph-smith-dna-revealed-new-clues-from-the-prophets-genes|title=Joseph Smith DNA Revealed: New Clues from the Prophet's Genes \u2013 FairMormon|work=FairMormon|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref> He was one of 11 children.
