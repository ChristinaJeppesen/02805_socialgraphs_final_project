An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy'', Watson expressed disdain for the truthfulness of mainstream media:\n\n<blockquote>The nature of the mass media today is such that the truth is irrelevant. What is true and what is right to the general public is what is defined as true and right by the mass media. [[Ronald Reagan]] understood that the facts are not relevant. The media reported what he said as fact. Follow-up investigation was \"old news.\" A headline comment on Monday's newspaper far outweighs the revelation of inaccuracy revealed in a small box inside the paper on Tuesday or Wednesday.<ref>Paul Watson. 1993. ''Earthforce! An Earth Warrior's Guide to Strategy''. La Ca\u0148ada, CA: Chaco Press, p. 42.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWatson was explicit about what he perceived to be the lack of truthfulness in mass media: \"If you do not know an answer, a fact, or a statistic, then simply follow the example of an American President and do as Ronald Reagan did\u2014make it up on the spot and deliver the information confidently and without hesitation.\"<ref>Paul Watson. 1993.

''New York Times'', November 10, 1986.</ref> In a subsequent book, ''Ocean Warrior'', Watson expanded on this view, saying: \"Survival in a media culture meant developing the skills to understand and manipulate media to achieve strategic objectives.\"<ref>Watson, Paul. ''Ocean Warrior''. Toronto: Key Porter Books, 1994, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nIn 2007 Watson explained his view of needed population control and the future for humans given their role in the [[Holocene extinction]], which he refers to as the \"Holocenic hominid collective suicide event\":\n\n<blockquote>Today, escalating human populations have vastly exceeded global carrying capacity and now produce massive quantities of solid, liquid, and gaseous waste [...] No human community should be larger than 20,000 people and separated from other communities by wilderness areas [...] We need to radically and intelligently reduce human populations to fewer than one billion [...] Curing a body of cancer requires radical and invasive therapy, and therefore, curing the biosphere of the human virus will also require a radical and invasive approach [...] Who should have children?
