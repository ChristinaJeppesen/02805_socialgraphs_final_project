The infobox is there to include additional occupations.--> who served as the 42nd [[president of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. He previously served as [[governor of Arkansas]] from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as [[attorney general of Arkansas]] from 1977 to 1979. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Clinton became known as a [[New Democrat]], as many of his policies reflected a [[centrist]] \"[[Third Way]]\" political philosophy. He is the husband of [[Hillary Clinton]], who was a [[United States senator|senator]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 2001 to 2009, [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].\n\nClinton was born and raised in [[Arkansas]] and attended [[Georgetown University]]. He received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to study at [[University College, Oxford]] and later graduated from [[Yale Law School]]. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by [[Governorships of Bill Clinton|two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor]]. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the [[National Governors Association]]. Clinton was elected president in the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], defeating incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] president [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Independent politician|independent]] businessman [[Ross Perot]]. At 46 years old, he became the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|third-youngest]] president of the United States and the first president to be born in the [[Baby boomers|Baby Boomer]] generation.\n\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], but failed to pass his plan for [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|national health care reform]]. The Republican Party [[Republican Revolution|won unified control]] of Congress for the first time in 40 years in the [[1994 United States elections|1994 elections]], but Clinton was still comfortably re-elected in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], becoming the first Democrat since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to win a second full term. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]], the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] and financial deregulation measures. He appointed [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer]] to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the [[Bosnian War|Bosnian]] and [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] wars, eventually signing the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace agreement]]. He also called for the [[Enlargement of NATO|expansion of NATO]] in Eastern Europe and many former [[Warsaw Pact]] members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the [[Middle East]] saw him sign the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] which gave aid to groups against [[Saddam Hussein]]. He also participated in the [[Oslo I Accord]] and [[2000 Camp David Summit|Camp David Summit]] to advance the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]], and assisted the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].\n\nClinton's second term was dominated by the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky scandal]] which began in 1996, when he allegedly had a sexual relationship with 22-year-old [[Monica Lewinsky]], an [[Internship|intern]] at the [[White House]]. In January 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Twenty years ago, the Drudge Report broke the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal |language=en-US |newspaper=Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/twenty-years-ago-the-drudge-report-broke-the-clinton-lewinsky-scandal/2018/01/09/3df90b7a-e0ec-11e7-89e8-edec16379010_story.html |access-date=April 6, 2022 |issn=0190-8286}}</ref> The scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached after [[Andrew Johnson]]. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around Clinton using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and that he [[Perjury|lied under oath]]. In 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. [[Impeachment trial of Bill Clinton|Clinton was acquitted]] on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, the conviction threshold.\n\nClinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest [[Opinion poll|approval rating]] of any U.S. president in the modern era, alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt and [[Ronald Reagan]]. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|historical rankings of U.S. presidents]]. However, his personal conduct and [[Bill Clinton sexual assault and misconduct allegations|allegations of sexual assault]] have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the [[Clinton Foundation]] to address international causes such as the prevention of [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[global warming]]. In 2009, he was named the [[United Nations]] [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Special Envoy]] to [[Haiti]]. After the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Clinton and [[George W. Bush]] formed the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]]. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|2008]] and [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|2016 presidential campaigns]].\n\n==Early life and career==\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site May 2018 3 (Bill Clinton Birthplace).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Clinton's [[President William Jefferson Clinton Birthplace Home National Historic Site|birthplace]] home in [[Hope, Arkansas]]]]}}\n[[File:Bill Clinton in 1963 Old Gold Book.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Clinton in [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]]'s 1963 yearbook]]\nClinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in [[Hope, Arkansas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/dir/pres.htm |title=Directory of Irish Genealogy: American Presidents with Irish Ancestors |publisher=Homepage.eircom.net |date=March 23, 2004 |access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> He is the son of [[William Jefferson Blythe Jr.]], a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (later Virginia Kelley).<ref name=\"whitehouse.gov bio\">{{cite web |title=Biography of William J.
