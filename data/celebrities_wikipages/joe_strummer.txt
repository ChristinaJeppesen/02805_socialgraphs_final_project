He was the co-founder, lyricist, rhythm guitarist and co-lead vocalist of [[punk rock]] band [[the Clash]], formed in 1976. The Clash's second album ''[[Give 'Em Enough Rope]]'' (1978) reached No. 2 on the UK charts. Soon after, they achieved success in the US, starting with ''[[London Calling]]'' (1979) and peaking with ''[[Combat Rock]]'' (1982), which reached No. 7 on the US charts and was certified 2\u00d7 platinum there. The Clash's explosive political lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious attitude had a far-reaching influence on rock music in general, especially [[alternative rock]].<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\">{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600955.stm| title = Strummer's lasting culture Clash| access-date =20 November 2007| date = 23 December 2002| format = STM| work=Entertainment| publisher=BBC News World Edition}}</ref> Their music incorporated [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[funk]], [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[rockabilly]].\n\nStrummer's other career highlights included stints with [[the 101ers]], [[the Latino Rockabilly War]], [[the Mescaleros]], and [[the Pogues]], as well as solo music. His work as a musician allowed him to explore other interests such as acting, scoring television shows and films and hosting the [[BBC Radio]] show ''London Calling''. Strummer and the Clash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 2003. In his remembrance, Strummer's friends and family established [[the Joe Strummer Foundation]] (initially known as Strummerville), a [[nonprofit organization]] which gives opportunities to musicians and support to projects around the world that create empowerment through music.\n\n==Early life==\nStrummer was born John Graham Mellor in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]] on 21 August 1952, the son of a Scottish mother and English father. His mother, Anna Mackenzie (1915\u20131986), was the daughter of a [[crofter]] and was born and raised in [[Bonar Bridge]]; she later became a nurse. His father, Ronald Ralph Mellor [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (1916\u20131984), was born in the Indian city of [[Lucknow]], India, where his own father worked as a railway official, and became a clerical officer who later attained the rank of second secretary in [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service|the foreign service]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-88710 | title=Strummer, Joe &#91;real name John Graham Mellor&#93; (1952\u20132002), rock musician and songwriter| doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/88710| year=2004}}</ref> Through his father, Strummer had an [[Armenians|Armenian]] great-grandfather and a [[German-Jewish]] great-grandmother.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006|pp=35, 205}} At the age of nine, Strummer and his 10-year-old brother David began boarding at the [[City of London Freemen's School]] in Surrey, and rarely saw their parents during the next seven years. He later said, \"[A]t the age of nine I had to say good-bye to them because they went abroad to Africa or something. I went to boarding school and only saw them once a year after that \u2013 the Government paid for me to see my parents once a year.

His suicide in July of that year profoundly affected Strummer, as did having to identify his body after it had lain undiscovered for three days.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}} Strummer said, \"[David] was a year older than me. Funnily enough, you know, he was a [[Nazis|Nazi]]. He was a member of the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]]. He was into the [[occult]] and he used to have these deaths-heads and cross-bones all over everything. He didn't like to talk to anybody, and I think suicide was the only way out for him.

He played in two bands, the Vultures and the 101ers, but when the Sex Pistols supported the 101ers in west London in 1976, Strummer saw the possibilities open up for him and was inspired to form the Clash.\n}}</ref> During this time, he shared a flat in [[Palmers Green]] with friends [[The Passions (British band)|Clive Timperley]] and [[Tymon Dogg]]. He said, \"I bought a ukulele. No kidding. I saved some money, \u00a31.99 I think, and bought it down [[Shaftesbury Avenue]]. Then the guy I was busking with taught me to play '[[Johnny B. Goode]]'.

His family spent time in Ankara, Cairo, Mexico City & [[Bonn]], before Mellor returned to the UK to attend the City of London Freemen's School in Surrey. Mellor left school & enrolled at Central College of Art but left \"after about a week\", heading straight for the underground & squat culture. Mellor spent time living in Wales, playing in knock-about bands and using the nickname \"Woody\" inspired by Woody Guthrie's name.  <br /> b) The Vultures in time led to the 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols. Mellor adopted the stage name of \"Joe Strummer\". Impressed by the power of the [[Sex Pistols]], the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were \"yesterday's papers\" by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of the Clash. <br /> c) \"This is my Indian summer ... I learnt that fame is an illusion & everything about it is just a joke. I'm far more dangerous now, because I don't care at all.\" \u2013 Joe Strummer to Chris Salewicz \u2013 2000.\n}}</ref> The Vultures included three former members of Rip Off Park Rock & Roll Allstars, the original college band co-founded by Terry Earl Taylor. For the next year, Strummer was the band's part-time singer and rhythm guitarist. During this time, he also worked as a [[gravedigger]] in [[St Woolos Cemetery]].<ref>Don J Whistance's Clash Site \u2013 [http://www.theclash.org.uk/joetheearlyyears.htm \"Joe the Early years\"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)</ref><ref>JoeStrummer.org \u2013 [http://www.joestrummer.org/bio.php \"Bio\"] (Retrieved 7 February 2014)</ref> Whilst in Newport, he wrote and recorded on an old [[reel-to-reel]] tape recorder \"Crumby Bum Blues\", which was later used in [[Julien Temple]]'s 2007 film ''[[Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten]]''. In 1974, the band fell apart and Strummer moved back to London, where he met up again with Dogg.  He was a street performer for a while and then decided to form another band with his roommates called [[the 101ers]],<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\" /> named after the address of their squat at 101 Walterton Road in [[Maida Vale]].<ref name=\"trackMARX-Joe_Strummer\" />{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} The band played many gigs in London pubs, performing covers of popular American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] songs. During this period Strummer worked a number of occasional temporary jobs to fund the purchase of musical equipment, including time spent as a gardener in Hyde Park \"to get the money for the guitar\".<ref>ARTE TV interview 2001 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqEI7O41NpM</ref> \n\nIn 1975, he stopped calling himself Woody Mellor and adopted the stage name Joe Strummer, subsequently insisting that his friends call him by that name. The surname \"Strummer\" apparently referred to his role as rhythm guitarist in a self-deprecating way. Strummer was the lead singer of the 101ers and began to write original songs for the group. One song he wrote was inspired by [[the Slits]]' drummer [[Palmolive (musician)|Palmolive]], who was his girlfriend at the time. The group liked the song \"Keys to Your Heart\", which they picked as their first single.{{sfn|Coon|1977}}\n\n==Career==\n=== The Clash (1976\u20131986) ===\n\n{{Main|The Clash}}\n\nOn 3 April 1976, the then-unknown [[Sex Pistols]] opened for the 101ers at a venue called the Nashville Rooms in London, and Strummer was impressed by them.<ref name=\"bbcco-Strummer\" /> Sometime after the show, Strummer was approached by [[Bernie Rhodes]] and [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]]. Jones was from the band [[London SS]] and wanted Strummer to join as lead singer. Strummer agreed to leave the 101ers and join Jones, bassist [[Paul Simonon]], drummer [[Terry Chimes]] and guitarist [[Keith Levene]].{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} The band was named [[the Clash]] by Simonon and made their debut on 4 July 1976 in [[Sheffield]], opening for the [[Sex Pistols]] at the Black Swan (also known as the Mucky Duck, now known as the [[Boardwalk (nightclub)|Boardwalk]]).{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} On 25 January 1977, the band signed with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] as a three-piece after Levene was fired from the band and Chimes quit. [[Topper Headon]] later became the band's full-time drummer.\n\nDuring his time with the Clash, Strummer, along with his bandmates, became notorious for getting into trouble with the law. On 10 June 1977, he and Headon were arrested for spray-painting the band's name on a wall in a hotel. On 20 May 1980, he was arrested for hitting a violent member of the audience with his guitar during a performance in [[Hamburg]], Germany. This incident shocked Strummer, and had a lasting personal impact on him. Strummer said, \"It was a watershed\u2014violence had really controlled me for once\". He determined never again to fight violence with violence.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}\n\nBefore the album ''[[Combat Rock]]'' was released in 1982, Strummer went into hiding and the band's management said that he had \"disappeared\". Bernie Rhodes, the band's manager, pressured Joe to do so because tickets were selling slowly for the Scottish leg of an upcoming tour.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006}}  It was planned for Strummer to travel, in secret, to Texas and stay with his friend, musician [[Joe Ely]]. Uneasy with his decision, Strummer instead decided to genuinely disappear and \"dicked around\" in France. During this time, Strummer ran the [[Paris Marathon]] in April 1982. He claimed his training regimen consisted of 10 pints of beer the night before the race. For this period of time, Joe's whereabouts were a mystery not only to the public, but to the band's management as well. Joe said later that this was a huge mistake and that you \"have to have some regrets\". This was in spite of the popular success of the single \"[[Rock the Casbah]]\". During this time, band members began to argue frequently, and with tensions high, the group began to fall apart.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}\n\nIn September 1983, Strummer issued the infamous \"Clash Communique\", and fired Mick Jones.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}} Topper Headon had earlier been kicked out of the band because of his heroin addiction, and Terry Chimes was brought back temporarily to fill his place until the permanent replacement, Pete Howard, could be found.  This left the band with only two of its original members, Strummer and Simonon.  Rhodes persuaded Strummer to carry on, adding two new guitarists.{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}  Under this lineup, they released the album ''[[Cut the Crap]]'' in 1985. The album was panned by fans and critics alike and Strummer disbanded the Clash.\n\nAt the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Clash was said to be \"considered one of the most overtly political, explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history\".<ref name=\"rockhall-The_Clash\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash|title=The Clash|access-date=19 November 2007|date=10 March 2003|work=Induction|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|quote=a) Quite simply, the Clash were among the most explosive and exciting bands in rock and roll history. <br>b, c) If not exactly a reunion, it was a rapprochement. On 15 November 2002, Jones and Strummer shared the stage for the first time in nearly 20&nbsp;years, performing three Clash songs during the encore of a London benefit show by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. This raised hopes for a Clash reunion, which were dashed when Strummer died of a heart attack on 22 December 2002.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430132108/http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-clash|archive-date=30 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTheir songs tackled social decay, unemployment, racism, police brutality, political and social repression, and militarism in detail. Strummer was involved with the [[Anti-Nazi League]] and [[Rock Against Racism]] campaigns. He later also gave his support to the Rock Against the Rich series of concerts organised by the anarchist organisation [[Class War]]. The Clash's ''[[London Calling]]'' album was voted best album of the 1980s by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine (although it was released in late 1979 in the UK, it was not released until 1980 in the US).<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2600669.stm\n|title=Clash star Strummer dies\n|access-date=20 November 2007\n|date=27 December 2002\n|format=STM\n|work=Entertainment\n|publisher=BBC News World Edition\n|quote=Rolling Stone voted London Calling, their classic 1980 album (released in 1979 in the UK) as the best album of the Eighties.\n}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career and soundtrack work (1986\u20131999)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Joe-Strummer.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Strummer, backing with the Pogues in Japan]]\nA year later, Strummer worked on several songs for the 1986 film ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'', including \"Love Kills\" and \"Dum Dum Club\". Strummer also later worked with Mick Jones and his band [[Big Audio Dynamite]], contributing to the band's second studio album, ''[[No. 10, Upping St.]]'' (1986), by co-writing most of the songs as well as producing the album along with Jones.\n\nIn 1987, he played a small part in the film ''[[Walker (film)|Walker]]'', directed by [[Alex Cox]], as a character named \"Faucet\" and wrote and performed on the film's [[Walker (album)|soundtrack]].  He starred in another Cox film that same year called ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'', as the character Simms. ''Straight to Hell'' also featured London-Irish folk/punk band [[the Pogues]], both as actors and contributors to the soundtrack. Strummer joined the Pogues for a tour in 1987/88, filling in for ailing guitarist [[Philip Chevron]], who wrote (in May 2008) on the band's online forum: \"When I was sick in late 1987, I taught Joe all the guitar parts in an afternoon and he was on tour in the US as deputy guitarist the next day. Joe wrote all the tabs in his meticulously neat hand on a long piece of paper which he taped to the top of the guitar so he could glance down occasionally when he was onstage.\" This tour would be the first of several collaborations with the band.\n\nIn 1989, Strummer appeared in [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s film ''[[Mystery Train (film)|Mystery Train]]'' as a drunken, short-tempered drifter named Johnny (whom most characters refer to as Elvis, much to Johnny's dismay). He made a cameo appearance in [[Aki Kaurism\u00e4ki]]'s 1990 film ''[[I Hired a Contract Killer]]'' as a guitarist in a pub, performing two songs (\"Burning Lights\" and \"Afro-Cuban Bebop\"). These were released as a promotional 7-inch single limited to a few hundred copies, credited to \"Joe Strummer & the Astro Physicians\". The \"Astro Physicians\" were in fact the Pogues (\"Afro-Cuban Bebop\" got a re-release on the Pogues' 2008 box set). During this time Strummer continued to act, write and produce soundtracks for various films, most notably the soundtrack for ''[[Grosse Pointe Blank]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 1989 Strummer produced a solo record with the band the Latino Rockabilly War. The album ''[[Earthquake Weather (album)|Earthquake Weather]]'' was a critical and commercial flop, and resulted in the loss of his contract with [[Sony Records]].  He also did the soundtrack to the movie ''[[Permanent Record (film)|Permanent Record]]'' with this band.\n\nStrummer was asked by the Pogues, who were fracturing as a band, to help them produce their next album, released in 1990 as ''[[Hell's Ditch]]''. In 1991, he replaced [[Shane MacGowan]] as singer of the Pogues for a tour after MacGowan's departure from the band. One night of this tour was professionally recorded, and three tracks (\"I Fought the Law\", \"London Calling\", and \"Turkish Song of the Damned\") have seen release as b-sides and again on the Pogues' 2008 box set.\n\nOn 16 April 1994, Strummer joined Czech-American band Dirty Pictures on stage in Prague at the Repre Club in Obecni Dum at \"Rock for Refugees\", a benefit concert for people left displaced by the war in Bosnia. Although the set appeared impromptu, Strummer and the band had spent the days leading up to the event rehearsing and \"hanging out\" in Prague. The show began with \"London Calling\" and without pause went into \"Brand New Cadillac\". In the middle of the song, the power went out.  Once the power was back on, Strummer asked the audience whether or not they would mind if the band started over. They then began again with \"London Calling\" and continued on for another half-hour.\n\nAfter these self-described \"wilderness years\", Strummer began working with other bands; he played piano on the 1995 UK hit of [[The Levellers (band)|the Levellers]], \"Just the One\" and appeared on the [[Black Grape]] single \"England's Irie\" in 1996. In 1997, while in New York City, he worked with noted producer and engineer [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]] on remixed Clash and 101ers reissue dub material. In collaboration with percussionist Pablo Cook, Strummer wrote and performed the soundtrack to ''Tunnel of Love'' (Robert Wallace 1997) that was featured in the Cannes Film Festival in the same year.\n\nIn 1997, Strummer played the character of \"Brand New Cadillac\" songwriter [[Vince Taylor]] in {{ill|F. J. Ossang|fr}}'s road movie {{ill|Doctor Chance|italic=yes|fr|Docteur Chance}}.\n\nIn 1998, he made a guest appearance on the animated television show, ''[[South Park]]'' and appeared on the album ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]'' featuring songs from and inspired by the series.\n\nDuring this time, Strummer was engaged in a legal dispute with the Clash's record label, [[Epic Records]]. The disagreement lasted nearly eight years and ended with the label agreeing to let him record solo records with another label. If the Clash were to reunite though, they would have to record for Sony. During the nineties, Strummer was a DJ on the [[BBC World Service]] with his half-hour programme ''London Calling''. Samples from the series provide the vocals for \"Midnight Jam\" on Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros' final album ''[[Streetcore]]''.\n\n===The Mescaleros and other work (1999\u20132002)===\n[[File:Joe Strummer performing at St Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn - NYC Apr 5 2002.jpg|thumb|Strummer performing in April 2002]]\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, Strummer gathered top-flight musicians into a backing band he called [[the Mescaleros]]. Strummer and the band signed with [[Mercury Records]], and released their first album in 1999, which was co-written with [[Antony Genn]], called ''[[Rock Art and the X-Ray Style]]''.

He covered [[Bob Marley]]'s \"[[Redemption Song]]\" with [[Johnny Cash]].\n\nOn 15 November 2002, Strummer and the Mescaleros played a benefit show for striking fire fighters in London, at [[Acton Town Hall]]. [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Mick Jones]] was in the audience, and joined the band on stage during the Clash's \"Bankrobber\".
