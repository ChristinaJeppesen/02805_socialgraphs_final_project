Poitier was aware of this pattern himself but was conflicted on the matter. He wanted more varied roles; but he also felt obliged to set an example with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes, as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry at the time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of ''[[Othello]]'' with that spirit in mind.<ref>Harris 2008, p. 161.</ref> Despite this, many of the films in which Poitier starred during the 1960s would later be cited as [[social thriller]]s by both filmmakers and critics.<ref name=\"Bleiler, 2013\">{{cite book|last1=Bleiler|first1=David|title=TLA Film and Video Guide 2000\u20132001: The Discerning Film Lover's Guide|date=2013|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4668-5940-1}}</ref><ref name=\"Maltin, 2008\">{{cite book|last1=Maltin|first1=Leonard|last2=Sader|first2=Luke|last3=Clark|first3=Mike|title=Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-452-28978-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/681 681]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452289789/page/681}}</ref><ref name=\"Thompson, 2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Bennie G. |title=Etension of Remarks: A Tribute to Ms. Beulah \"Beah\" Richards |journal=Congressional Record |date=March 10, 2004 |volume=150 |issue=3 |page=2872 |publisher=Government Printing Office }}</ref><ref name=\"Ebiri, 2017\">{{cite news|last1=Ebiri|first1=Bilge|title=Get Out's Jordan Peele Brings the 'Social Thriller' to BAM|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/02/14/get-outs-jordan-peele-brings-the-social-thriller-to-bam/|access-date=August 1, 2017|work=The Village Voice|date=February 14, 2017|archive-date=November 8, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108211916/https://www.villagevoice.com/2017/02/14/get-outs-jordan-peele-brings-the-social-thriller-to-bam/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\n''In the Heat of the Night'' featured his most successful character, Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, detective whose subsequent career was the subject of two sequels: ''[[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Organization (film)|The Organization]]'' (1971).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://greensboro.com/sidney-poitiers-tibbs-trilogy-out-on-dvd/article_ba3cc2ed-5ca3-503a-88e4-fe1ab969e42f.html|title=Sidney Poitier's \"Tibbs Trilogy\" Out On DVD|author=Nye, Doug|date=January 18, 2001|access-date=January 7, 2022|newspaper=Greensboro News|publisher=Knight Ridder|archive-date=January 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107173703/https://greensboro.com/sidney-poitiers-tibbs-trilogy-out-on-dvd/article_ba3cc2ed-5ca3-503a-88e4-fe1ab969e42f.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 he made his feature film directorial debut, the [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''Buck and the Preacher'', in which Poitier also starred, alongside [[Harry Belafonte]] and Ruby Dee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4470/buck-and-the-preacher#overview|title=Buck and the Preacher|access-date=January 7, 2022|publisher=TMC|archive-date=January 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107180429/https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/4470/buck-and-the-preacher#overview|url-status=live}}</ref> Poitier replaced the original director, [[Joseph Sargent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54565|title=Buck and the Preacher|access-date=January 7, 2022|publisher=AFI|archive-date=January 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107174927/https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/54565|url-status=live}}</ref> The following year he directed his second feature, the romantic drama ''[[A Warm December]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prod-www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/95108/a-warm-december#overview|title=A Warm December|publisher=TMC|access-date=January 7, 2022|archive-date=January 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107174929/https://prod-www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/95108/a-warm-december#overview|url-status=live}}</ref> Poitier also starred in the film alongside [[Esther Anderson (Jamaican actress)|Esther Anderson]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, Poitier directed several financially successful comedy films, including three in which he also starred: ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]'' (1974) with [[Bill Cosby]] and Harry Belafonte; and ''[[Let's Do It Again (1975 film)|Let's Do It Again]]'' (1975) and ''[[A Piece of the Action (film)|A Piece of the Action]]'' (1977), both with Cosby.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blackclassicmovies.com/uptown-saturday-night/|title=Uptown Saturday Night|publisher=Black Classic Movies|access-date=January 7, 2022|archive-date=January 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220107174934/https://www.blackclassicmovies.com/uptown-saturday-night/|url-status=live}}</ref> His most successful comedy was ''[[Stir Crazy (film)|Stir Crazy]]'' (1980), starring [[Richard Pryor]] and [[Gene Wilder]], which for many years was the highest-grossing film directed by a person of African descent.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite book|author=Earl G.
