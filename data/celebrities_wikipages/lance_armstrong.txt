Regarded as a sports icon for winning the [[Tour de France]] seven consecutive times from [[1999 Tour de France|1999]] to [[2005 Tour de France|2005]] after recovering from [[testicular cancer]], he was later stripped of all his titles when an investigation found that he [[Lance Armstrong doping case|had used performance-enhancing drugs over his career]].\n\nAt age 16, Armstrong began competing as a [[triathlon|triathlete]] and was a national sprint-course triathlon champion in 1989 and 1990. In 1992, he began his career as a professional cyclist with the [[Motorola Cycling Team|Motorola]] team. He had success between 1993 and 1996 with the [[UCI Road World Championships|World Championship]] in [[1993 UCI Road World Championships|1993]], the [[Cl\u00e1sica de San Sebasti\u00e1n]] in 1995, [[Tour DuPont]] in 1995 and 1996, and a handful of stage victories in Europe, including stage 8 of the [[1993 Tour de France]] and stage 18 of the [[1995 Tour de France]]. In 1996, he was diagnosed with a potentially fatal [[Metastasis|metastatic]] [[testicular cancer]]. After his recovery, he founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the [[Livestrong Foundation]]) to assist other cancer survivors.\n\nReturning to cycling in 1998, Armstrong was a member of the [[U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team|US Postal/Discovery]] team between 1998 and 2005 when he won his seven Tour de France titles. Armstrong retired from racing at the end of the 2005 Tour de France, but returned to competitive cycling with the [[Astana Pro Team|Astana team]] in January 2009, finishing third in the [[2009 Tour de France]] later that year. Between 2010 and 2011, he raced with [[Team Radio Shack]], and retired for a second time in 2011.\n\nArmstrong became the subject of [[History of Lance Armstrong doping allegations|doping allegations]] after he won the 1999 Tour de France.

Armstrong's total points in 1987 as an amateur were better than those of five professionals ranked higher than he was that year.

Before his World Championships win, he took his first win at the [[1993 Tour de France|Tour de France]], in the stage from [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]] to [[Verdun]]. He was 97th in the general classification when he retired after stage 12.

Only a minute and a second separated the two at the end of the final day in Paris. U.S. Postal won the [[team time trial]] on stage 4 and on stage 9 Armstrong nearly crashed out of the Tour while defending the yellow jersey. He was less than a minute ahead of Beloki and [[Alexander Vinokourov]] was on a solo attack threatening to overtake Armstrong in the standings.

He became the first biker since [[Gino Bartali]] in 1948 to win three consecutive mountain stages; 15, 16, and 17. The individual time trial on stage 16 up [[Alpe d'Huez]] was won in style by Armstrong as he passed [[Ivan Basso]] on the way despite having set out two minutes after the Italian. He won sprint finishes from Basso in stages 13 and 15 and made up a significant gap in the last 250&nbsp;m to nip Kl\u00f6den at the line in stage 17.

His Discovery Channel team won the team time trial, while Armstrong won the final individual time trial. In the mountain stages, Armstrong's lead was attacked multiple times mostly by Ivan Basso, but also by T-mobile leaders Jan Ullrich, Andreas Kloden and Alexandre Vinokourov and former teammate [[Levi Leipheimer]]. But still, the American champion handled them well, maintained his lead and, on some occasions, increased it. To complete his record-breaking feat, he crossed the line on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on July 24 to win his seventh consecutive Tour, finishing 4&nbsp;m 40s ahead of Basso, with Ullrich third.

A medical certificate showed he used an approved cream for [[saddle sores]] which contained the substance.<ref name=\"velonews050823\" /> O'Reilly said she heard team officials worrying about Armstrong's positive test for steroids during the Tour. She said: \"They were in a panic, saying: 'What are we going to do?

He said she would have known if Armstrong had saddle sores as she would have administered any treatment for it.

Vrijman was head of the Dutch anti-doping agency for ten years; since then he has worked as a defense attorney defending high-profile athletes against doping charges.<ref name=\"California Western School of Law\" /> Vrijman's report cleared Armstrong because of improper handling and testing.<ref name=\"Armstrong cleared in drug inquiry\" /><ref name=\"UCI report clears Armstrong\" /> The report said tests on urine samples were conducted improperly and fell so short of scientific standards that it was \"completely irresponsible\" to suggest they \"constitute evidence of anything.\"<ref name=\"Max2006\" />\n\nThe recommendation of the commission's report was no disciplinary action against any rider on the basis of LNDD research. It also called upon the WADA and LNDD to submit themselves to an investigation by an outside independent authority.<ref name=\"Scholten c.s.

The Andreus' testimony was related to litigation between Armstrong and SCA Promotions, a Texas company attempting to withhold a $5&nbsp;million bonus; this was settled out of court with SCA paying Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5&nbsp;million, to cover the $5&nbsp;million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. The testimony stated \"And so the doctor asked him a few questions, not many, and then one of the questions he asked was&nbsp;... have you ever used any performance-enhancing drugs?

And Lance said, [[growth hormone]], [[cortisone]], [[Erythropoietin|EPO]], [[steroid]]s and [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]].\"<ref name=\"npr.org\" />\n\nArmstrong suggested Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his ''post-operative treatment'' which included steroids and EPO that are taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell-destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy.<ref name=\"Armstrong issues statement\" /> The Andreus' allegation was not supported by any of the eight other people present, including Armstrong's doctor Craig Nichols,<ref name=\"Papers charge Armstrong admitted doping\" /> or his medical history. According to Greg LeMond (who has been [[Greg Lemond anti-doping stance and controversies#Lance Armstrong and Trek|embroiled]] with his own disputes with Armstrong), he (LeMond) had a recorded conversation, the transcript of which was reviewed by [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), with Stephanie McIlvain (Armstrong's contact at Oakley Inc.) in which she said of Armstrong's alleged admission 'You know, I was in that room. I heard it.' However, McIlvain has contradicted LeMond's allegations on the issue and denied under oath that the incident in question ever occurred in her sworn testimony.<ref name=\"npr.org\" />\n\nIn July 2006, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a story on the allegations raised in the SCA case.<ref name=\"trail\" /> The report cited evidence at the trial, including the results of the LNDD test and an analysis of these results by an expert witness.<ref name=\"Evidence of a banned substance?\" /> From the ''Los Angeles Times'' article: \"The results, Australian researcher Michael Ashenden testified in Dallas, show Armstrong's levels rising and falling, consistent with a series of injections during the Tour.
