Two years later, he matriculated at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] and transferred to the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend [[Stanford University]]. After two days, he dropped out and with his brother [[Kimbal Musk|Kimbal]], co-founded the online [[city guide]] software company [[Zip2]]. In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by [[Compaq]] and Musk co-founded the online bank [[X.com]]. X.com merged with [[Confinity]] in 2000 to form [[PayPal]], and Musk was ousted from PayPal's board of directors.\n\nIn 2002, with his $175.8&nbsp;million from [[eBay]]'s acquisition of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a [[spaceflight]] services company. In 2004, he was an early investor in the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.). He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create [[SolarCity]], a solar energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became [[Tesla Energy]]. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit [[artificial intelligence]] research company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink\u2014a [[neurotechnology]] company developing [[brain\u2013computer interfaces]]\u2014and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, Musk [[Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk|purchased the social media platform Twitter]] for $44 billion. He has proposed a [[hyperloop]] high-speed [[vactrain]] transportation system.\n\nMusk has made controversial statements on politics and technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a polarizing figure. He has also been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, such as spreading [[COVID-19 misinformation]]. In 2018, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. Musk stepped down as chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine as part of a settlement agreement with the SEC.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and family===\n{{Further|Musk family}}\nElon Reeve
