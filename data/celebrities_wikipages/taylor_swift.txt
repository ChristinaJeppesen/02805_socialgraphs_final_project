Born in [[West Reading, Pennsylvania]], Swift moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] at age 14 to become a [[Country music|country]] artist. She signed a songwriting deal with [[Sony Music Publishing|Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in 2004 and a recording contract with [[Big Machine Records]] in 2005. Her 2006 [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut album]] made her the first female country singer to write or co-write a U.S. [[RIAA certification|platinum-certified]] album entirely.\n\nSwift's next albums, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008) and ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010), explored [[country pop]]. The former's \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\" and \"[[You Belong with Me]]\" were the first country songs to top the U.S. [[Mainstream Top 40|pop]] and [[Radio Songs (chart)|all-genre airplay]] charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and [[Electronic music|electronic]] styles on ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), which featured her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one song, \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\", and eschewed her country image in her [[synth-pop]] album, ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), supported by chart-topping songs \"[[Shake It Off]]\", \"[[Blank Space]]\", and \"[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]\". Media scrutiny inspired the [[Urban music|urban]]-flavored [[Reputation (album)|''Reputation'']] (2017) and its number-one single \"[[Look What You Made Me Do]]\".\n\nExiting Big Machine, Swift signed with [[Republic Records]] in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' (2020). She ventured into [[indie folk]] and [[alternative rock]] in her 2020 albums ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore (Taylor Swift album)|Evermore]]'', whose singles \"[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]\" and \"[[Willow (song)|Willow]]\" topped the Hot 100. Swift began [[Re-recording (music)|re-recording]] her first six albums after a [[Taylor Swift masters controversy|dispute]] over their [[Mastering (audio)|masters]], re-releasing two in 2021\u2014''[[Fearless (Taylor's Version)]]'' and ''[[Red (Taylor's Version)]]''. The latter's \"[[All Too Well (10 Minute Version)]]\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her tenth album ''[[Midnights]]'' (2022) and its lead single \"[[Anti-Hero (song)|Anti-Hero]]\" broke numerous streaming records. Swift has self-directed music videos and films, such as ''[[All Too Well: The Short Film]]'' (2021), and had supporting roles in [[Taylor Swift videography|others]].\n\nHaving sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling musicians of all time]]. She is the only act to have five albums open with over [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|one million copies sold]] in the US. Among [[List of awards and nominations received by Taylor Swift|her accolades]] are 11 [[Grammy Awards]], including three [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] wins; an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]]; 40 [[American Music Awards]]; 29 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]; and 84 [[Guinness World Records|''Guinness World Records'']]. Swift has been featured in rankings such as [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]], [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Greatest of All Time Artists, the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] and [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]]. Honored with titles such as [[American Music Awards#Artist of the Decade|Artist of the Decade]] and [[Billboard Women in Music#Woman of the Decade Award|Woman of the Decade]], Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and [[women's empowerment]].
