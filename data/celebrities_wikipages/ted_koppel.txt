After becoming host of ''Nightline'', he was regarded as one of the outstanding serious-minded interviewers on American television. Five years after its 1980 debut, the show had a nightly audience of about 7.5 million viewers.<ref>\"Meet Mr. Perfect of television news\", ''The Washington Post'', April 6, 1985</ref>\n\nAfter leaving ''Nightline'', Koppel worked as [[managing editor]] for the [[Discovery Channel]], a news analyst for [[NPR]] and [[BBC World News America]] and a contributor to ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams]]''. Koppel continues as a special contributor to ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]''. His career as foreign and diplomatic correspondent earned him numerous awards, including nine [[Overseas Press Club]] awards and 25 [[Emmy Awards]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nKoppel, an only child, was born in [[Nelson, Lancashire|Nelson]], England. His parents were German [[Jews]] who fled Germany after the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism]].<ref name=Ehrlichman/> In Germany, Koppel's father operated a tire-manufacturing company. To help the British economy, the [[Home Secretary]] invited him and his wife to move the factory to [[Lancashire]], [[England]], where he was promised they would be protected in the event of war.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> The factory moved in 1936, but when war broke out in Europe in 1939, Koppel's father was declared an [[enemy alien]] and imprisoned on the [[Isle of Man]] for a year and a half.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>\n\nKoppel was born in 1940, shortly after his father was taken away. To provide for her infant son, his mother sold her personal jewelry and did menial work in London.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> After he was released from internment, Koppel's father was not permitted to work in England, nor would he allow his wife to work. Following the end of the war, the family earned some money from their confiscated assets and decided to leave for the United States.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> While in England, Ted Koppel was a pupil at [[Abbotsholme School]], in Derbyshire. In 1953 at the age of 13, the family immigrated to the United States,<ref name=Ehrlichman>[[John Ehrlichman]]. \"Why We Stay Up for Ted Koppel.\" ''[[Parade Magazine]]'', September 27, 1987, pp. P18, 20-21.</ref> where his mother, Alice, became a singer and pianist, and his father, Edwin, opened a tire factory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/71/Ted-Koppel.html |title=Ted Koppel Biography (1940\u2013) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=2010-07-18}}</ref> Koppel's boyhood hero was radio broadcaster [[Edward R.

''Political Commentators in the United States in the 20th Century''. Greenwood Press, 1997, p. 151.</ref> Koppel attended [[Syracuse University]], graduating at age 20 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. He was a member of the Alpha Chi chapter of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity. His roommate recalls that Koppel \"was incredibly focused and had a photographic memory. He remembers almost every conversation he ever had with anybody. And the man never needs sleep.\"<ref name=WashPost/>\n\nKoppel then went to [[Stanford University]], where he earned a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[Mass communications|mass-communications]] research and [[political science]].<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web|title=Ted Koppel|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/News/story?id=128629|publisher=ABC News|date=November 17, 2005|access-date=January 2, 2011}}</ref> While at Stanford, he met his future wife, Grace Anne Dorney.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>\n\n==Career==\n===News correspondent===\n[[File:Ted Koppel 1976.JPG|thumb|150px|Koppel as the diplomatic correspondent for ABC News, 1976]]\n\nKoppel had a brief stint as a teacher before being hired as a [[copyboy]] at ''[[The New York Times]]'' and as a writer at [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA Radio]] in New York. In June 1963, he became the youngest correspondent ever hired by [[ABC Radio News]], working on the daily ''Flair Reports'' program. His coverage of the [[Kennedy assassination]] in 1963 with [[Charles Osgood]], caused the national news audience to take notice.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> He was scheduled to do a short report, but a delay during the crisis forced him to ad-lib for an hour and a half.<ref name=Moritz/>\n\nIn 1964, he covered his first of many presidential nominating conventions. He also began covering the [[civil rights movement]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. ABC officials were impressed by Koppel's ability to clarify issues using plain language.<ref name=Moritz/> In 1966, he became the ABC News correspondent for the [[Vietnam War]], moving from radio broadcasting to national television.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> He accepted the assignment only after the network agreed to send his wife and their two children to Hong Kong so they could be nearby.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> Before going he took a course to learn the Vietnamese language.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>\n\nHe returned in 1968 to cover the campaign of [[Richard Nixon]], before becoming Hong Kong bureau chief, and [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] correspondent where Koppel formed a friendship with [[Henry Kissinger]].<ref name=Ehrlichman/> According to Nixon advisor [[John Ehrlichman]], Koppel's friendship with Kissinger was partly due to their similar backgrounds, having Jewish refugee parents and emigrating to America in their youth.<ref name=Ehrlichman/>\n\nKoppel was among those traveling to China with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972. He spoke about it with the [[University of Southern California|USC]] US-China Institute in their \"Assignment: China\" documentary series about American media coverage of China.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=2672 |title=Assignment: China - The Week that Changed the World &#124; US-China Institute |website=China.usc.edu |access-date=2017-01-18}}</ref> Koppel likened the trip to a \"journey to the dark side of the moon\". By 1975, he was anchoring the ABC Evening News on Saturdays, and he continued to file reports for ABC Radio.<ref>[https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/k/koppel_t.htm \"The Ted Koppel Collection\"]. Syracuse University Library, Special Collections.</ref>\n\nKoppel would often report on State Department foreign conferences, as when he traveled with Kissinger during his meetings in Egypt and Israel in 1975.<ref name=Ehrlichman/> He said about Kissinger: \"I have a high regard for Henry. He has a first-class mind. A half hour with him gives me a better insight into a foreign policy question than hours with others.\"<ref name=Ehrlichman/>\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Koppel took a year off from his career, to stay home with his children so that his wife could complete her education at [[Georgetown Law School]]. Koppel's decision upset ABC News president [[Roone Arledge]], who demoted Koppel from news anchor when he returned to the network.<ref name=WashPost>\"The Real King of Late Night\", ''The Washington Post'', June 12, 1996</ref>\n\nIn April 1979, he was lead reporter for an eleven-segment series, \"Second to None?\", which focused on explaining the dangers of nuclear war. He did his own research and wanted to present \"complex material to an audience that hasn't paid much attention in the past but must in the future ... ''if'' there is to be a future\".<ref name=Moritz/> For the series he received an [[Alfred I. duPont\u2013Columbia University Award]].<ref name=Moritz/>\n\n===Nelson Mandela interview===\nIn 1990, Koppel interviewed [[Nelson Mandela]] in a US-style [[town hall meeting]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryO3En-zG68 Nelson Mandela destroys Ted Koppel Part 1]</ref>\n\n==Host of ''Nightline''==\nKoppel became known for his work as the host of a late night news program called ''[[Nightline]]''. The program originated as a series of special reports about the 444-day-long [[Iran hostage crisis]], during which Iranian militants held 52 Americans captive, beginning in early November 1979. At first, the program was called ''The Iran Crisis: America Held Hostage'', and was hosted by [[Frank Reynolds]]. Koppel eventually joined Reynolds as co-anchor. In March 1980, the program evolved into ''Nightline'', with Koppel as its host.<ref>\"Ask the Globe\". ''The Boston Globe'', April 28, 1988, p. 52.</ref> In 1990, ABC News ran a one-hour special called \"The Best of Nightline with Ted Koppel\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfXfS8JTMKI \"The Best of Nightline with Ted Koppel\"], 1 hour</ref> Koppel spent twenty-five years anchoring the program, before leaving ABC (and leaving as host of ''Nightline'') in late November 2005.<ref>Mark Jurkowitz. \"Koppel to Leave Nightline and ABC News\". ''The Boston Globe'', April 1, 2005, p. D5.</ref>\n\nWhile hosting ''Nightline'', Koppel also hosted a series of special programs called ''Viewpoint'', beginning in 1981, which provided media criticism and analysis. The show was envisioned by ABC News Vice President George Watson as a way to address any media bias that viewers might believe that they encountered on the network. Broadcast before a live audience, it provided viewers with a chance to question how stories were reported or critique television news.<ref>Judy Flander. \"Ted Koppel to Moderate 'Viewpoint.'\" Chicago Tribune, August 12, 1982, Section 4, p. 11.</ref> ''Viewpoint'' was broadcast sporadically, from 1981 until 1997.\n\nSome liberal groups suggested that Koppel was a conduit for the government's point of view and accused him of favoring conservatives when selecting guests.<ref>\"Koppel Looks Back on a Decade of Nightline\". ''The Boston Globe'', November 8, 1989, p. 80</ref> In the late 1980s, the progressive media criticism organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) claimed that policymakers and ex-officials dominated the ''Nightline'' guest list, with critics of foreign policy less visible. In 1987, ''[[Newsweek]]'' called him the \"quintessential establishment journalist\". Koppel responded that \"We are governed by the president and his cabinet and their people. And they are the ones who are responsible for our foreign policy, and they are the ones I want to talk to\".<ref name=SolomonN-FAIR-2801>Solomon, Norman. \u2013  [http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2801 \"Ted Koppel: 'Natural Fit' at NPR News and Longtime Booster of Henry Kissinger\"]. \u2013 Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR). \u2013 January 16, 2006</ref>\n\n=== Controversy regarding Pol Pot Video ===\nIn 1997, [[Nate Thayer]], a journalist writing for the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'' who later interviewed [[Pol Pot]] shortly before Pol Pot's death, claimed that Koppel and [[ABC News]] made a [[oral contract|verbal agreement]] with Thayer for the exclusive North American rights to use video from a show trial of Pol Pot that Thayer and Asiaworks Television videographer David McKaige witnessed on ''Nightline''. Thayer claimed ABC purportedly violated that agreement by posting [[screenshot]] stills of video from the interview on [[ABCNews.com]], violating the license as the site was accessible throughout the world, though not uploading the actual video.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=2282 |author=Kelly Heyboer|title=A Journalistic Coup Turns Sour|journal=American Journalism Review|date=September 1997|pages=10\u201311 |access-date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Departure from ''Nightline'' ===\n[[File:Ted Koppel at the 62nd Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|thumb|right|Ted Koppel at the 62nd Annual Peabody Awards]]\nOn November 22, 2005, Koppel stepped down from ''Nightline'' after 25 years with the program and left ABC after 42 years with the network. His final ''Nightline'' broadcast did not feature clips highlighting memorable interviews and famous moments from his tenure as host, as is typical when an anchor retires.
