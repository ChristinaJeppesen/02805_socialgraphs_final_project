It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season of all time by [[ESPN]] in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was, at the time, an NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns. He led the Patriots to the first undefeated regular season since the 16-game schedule was implemented in 1978. He directed an offense that scored a then-NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth-most ever in a season. For his efforts, Brady was named the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] and [[National Football League Offensive Player of the Year Award|Offensive Player of the Year]].
