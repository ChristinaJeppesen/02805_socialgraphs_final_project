Goodell came down hard on the Patriots because he felt Belichick's authority over football operations (Belichick is effectively the Patriots' general manager as well as head coach) was such that his decisions were \"properly attributed\" to the Patriots as well.<ref name=\"NFL1b7e\"/> Goodell said he considered suspending Belichick, but decided against it because he felt fining them and stripping them of a draft pick were \"more effective\" than a suspension.<ref name=\"espn070914\"/>\n\n====2011 NFL lockout====\n{{further|2011 NFL lockout}}\n\nOutside of player conduct, Goodell is also known for his work in the [[2011 NFL lockout]].

Then-defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] administered the program, and as many as 27 Saints defensive players were involved. Later that month, Goodell handed down some of the harshest penalties in NFL history. He suspended Williams, who had left to become defensive coordinator of the [[St. Louis Rams]], indefinitely (Williams was reinstated at the start of the 2013 season).  Goodell also suspended head coach [[Sean Payton]] for the entire 2012 season, general manager [[Mickey Loomis]] for eight games and assistant head coach [[Joe Vitt]] for six games.  Additionally, the Saints themselves were fined a league maximum $500,000 and had to forfeit their second round draft picks in [[2012 NFL Draft|2012]] and [[2013 NFL Draft|2013]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2012/03/sean-peyton-suspended-saints-fined-for-bounty-program/1 |title=Sean Payton suspended, Saints fined for bounty program |work=USA Today |first=Robert |last=Klemko |date=March 21, 2012 |access-date=October 11, 2013}}</ref>  Goodell was particularly upset that those involved in the program lied about it during two separate league investigations of the program.
