Her career goal at the time was to be a [[newscaster]] and she often did the cast news reports.\n\nRipa was cast in her first major acting role in 1990 as [[Hayley Vaughan]], a troubled party girl, on ''[[All My Children]]''. She concluded her 12-year stint in 2002, but returned for two episodes in 2010 to help celebrate the soap opera's 40th anniversary.\n\n===''Live!''===\nAfter co-host [[Kathie Lee Gifford]]'s final show on ''Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee'', [[Regis Philbin]] began holding on-air auditions to find her replacement. In his autobiography, ''How I Got This Way'', Philbin says of discovering Ripa:\n\n<blockquote>There was one guest we'd had on with us a few years before who had [a certain sparkle]. Hers was a natural, quick-witted, unaffected, confident, fun-loving kind of sparkle that both [[Michael Gelman|Gelman]] and I remembered very well. We decided to invite her back, this time to consider her as a possible co-host. So that was when this smiling, petite ball of fire named Kelly Ripa made her return to ''Live!'' for a test run at the rotating, up-for-grabs hot seat to my left. And my God, who knew what spontaneous combustion we'd make together?<ref>[http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780062109750 How I Got This Way] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305021734/http://www.harpercollins.com/browseinside/index.aspx?isbn13=9780062109750 |date=2012-03-05 }}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the day of Ripa's initial ''Live! with Regis'' tryout (November 1, 2000), psychic [[Char Margolis]] was among the guests. During this segment, Margolis guessed that Ripa was pregnant with her second child. Ripa replied, \"I haven't told my boss yet!\" Philbin later said that Ripa was first among the potential candidates including [[Jane Krakowski]], [[Valerie Bertinelli]], [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Bernadette Peters]]: \"[I]t could only be Kelly. We knew that from her memorable debut onward.\" Ripa was announced as the official replacement on February 5, 2001. Within months the renamed ''Live! with Regis and Kelly'''s young-audience demographics increased by 80 percent with Ripa credited for bringing \"a new life to the show.\"\n\nThe chemistry between Philbin and Ripa (or \"Pippa\" as he nicknamed her), their banter, interviews, and conversations about their families, personal lives, and New York City attracted a successful, strong, and loyal viewership averaging 6 million viewers daily.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111202211132/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/12/01/syndicated-tv-ratings-wheel-of-fortune-stays-ahead-of-judge-judy-in-regis-final-week-live-takes-top-talk-show-honors/112456/ {{\"'}}Live' Takes Top Talk Show Honors\"].</ref> In January 2011, Philbin, 80, announced that he would be retiring from ''Live!'' at the end of the year. His final show aired Friday, November 18, 2011, during which Ripa tearfully reminisced about her first day, the 43 steps they walked together from her dressing room onto set each day for 11 years, and how those 43 steps changed her life. \"Thank you for everything! It's been just great my Pippa,\" Philbin told her in an embrace. Ripa responded, \"Thank you for everything. I love you.\" \"I love you, too,\" said Philbin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dyball |first=Rennie |date=November 19, 2011 |title=Regis Philbin: I'm Going Out a Pretty Proud and Happy Guy |url=https://people.com/tv/regis-and-kelly-regis-philbin-last-show/ |access-date=March 5, 2019 |website=People}}</ref>\n\nRipa replaced Philbin as the head of the show and returned the following Monday, November 21, 2011, to continue the show, which was re-titled ''[[Live! with Kelly]]''. In a process similar to the one in which she was selected to replace Gifford, a rotating lineup of co-hosts auditioned on-air with Ripa to take over her former co-hosting duties, including: [[Michael Strahan]], [[Seth Meyers]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Nick Lachey]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Chris Harrison]], [[Jerry O'Connell]], [[Joel McHale]], [[Carrie Ann Inaba]], [[Bryant Gumbel]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Mike Greenberg]], [[Boomer Esiason]], [[Dan Abrams]], [[Martin Short]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[Pat Kiernan]], [[Jesse Palmer]], [[D.L.

Another round of guest co-hosts ensued. On May 1, 2017, the show became ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'', after [[Ryan Seacrest]] took over as Strahan's permanent replacement.\n\n===''Hope & Faith''===\nRipa ventured into primetime in September 2003 on ''[[Hope & Faith]]'', playing Faith Fairfield, an unemployed ex-soap star. The half-hour sitcom, co-starring [[Faith Ford]], [[Ted McGinley]], and [[Megan Fox]], gave [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] its best Friday premiere score since 1996. The show ended in May 2006 with Ripa declaring she \"never wanted to work that hard again.\"\n\n===Film===\nBest known for her television work, Ripa also has several feature films to her credit.
