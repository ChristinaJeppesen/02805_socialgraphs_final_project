She began her comedy career as a teenager and received her breakthrough on the television series ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1984. After a series of television and film roles that introduced her to a larger national audience, O'Donnell hosted her own syndicated daytime talk show, ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'', between 1996 and 2002, which won several [[Daytime Emmy Awards]]. During this period, she developed the nickname \"Queen of Nice\", as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2007, O'Donnell endured a controversial run as the moderator on the daytime talk show ''[[The View (talk show)|The View]]'', which included a public feud with [[Donald Trump]] and on-air disputes regarding the [[Presidency of George W.
