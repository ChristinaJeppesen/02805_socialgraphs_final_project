As a child he was exposed to sailing through his grandfather and these experiences would go on to influence his later music. He graduated from [[McGill-Toolen Catholic High School|McGill Institute for Boys]] in 1964. He began playing guitar during his first year at [[Auburn University]] before continuing his college years at [[Pearl River Community College]] and the [[University of Southern Mississippi]] in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 1969. He is an initiate of [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity at the University of Southern Mississippi. After graduating from college, Buffett worked as a correspondent for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], breaking the news of the separation of [[Flatt and Scruggs]].\n\nBuffett married Margie Washichek in 1969; they divorced in 1971. Buffett spent years working as the first mate on the yacht of industrialist [[The Rival Company|Foster Talge]] on the ''Petticoat III'' in Key West while perfecting the \"Caribbean Rock n' Roll\" genre. Buffett and his second wife, Jane (n\u00e9e Slagsvol) have two daughters, [[Savannah Buffett|Savannah Jane]] and Sarah Delaney (Sarah was almost named Sara Loraine, after her grandmother, but was named Sarah Delaney after her grandfather),<ref>personal letter dated January 6, 1992</ref> and an adopted son, Cameron Marley, and reside in [[Sag Harbor, New York]], and [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. They separated in the early 1980s, but reconciled in 1991. Buffett also owns a home in [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy|Saint Barts]], a Caribbean island where he lived on and off in the early 1980s while he was part owner of the Autour de Rocher hotel and restaurant. He spends part of the summer traveling about the East Coast on his sailboat. An avid pilot, Buffett owns a [[Dassault Falcon 900]] that he often uses while on concert tour and traveling worldwide.

Today, he is a regular visitor to the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Saint Barts]] and other islands where he gets inspiration for many of his songs and some of the characters in his books.\n\nWith the untimely death of friend and mentor [[Jim Croce]] in September 1973, ABC/Dunhill Records tapped Buffett to fill his space. Earlier, Buffett had visited Croce's farm in Pennsylvania and met with Croce in Florida.<ref>Steve Eng. ''The Man from Margaritaville Revealed.'' Page 144.</ref><ref>Mark Humphrey.

Albums ''[[Living & Dying in 3/4 Time]]'' and ''[[A1A (album)|A1A]]'' both followed in 1974, ''[[Havana Daydreamin']]'' appeared in 1976, and ''[[Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes]]'' followed in 1977, which featured the breakthrough hit song \"[[Margaritaville]]\".\n\n[[File:Jimmy Buffett at Clemson (Taps 1977).png|thumb|Buffett performing at [[Clemson University]] in 1977]]\n\nDuring the 1980s, Buffett made far more money from his tours than his albums and became known as a popular concert draw. He released a series of albums during the following 20 years, primarily to his devoted audience, and also branched into writing and merchandising. In 1985, Buffett opened a \"Margaritaville\" retail store in Key West, and in 1987, he opened the Margaritaville Cafe.\n\nIn 1994, Buffett dueted with [[Frank Sinatra]] on a cover of \"[[Mack the Knife]]\" on Sinatra's final studio album, \"[[Duets II (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets II]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1994-11-15-1994319146-story.html|title=Sinatra and his collaborators end up odd couples in the listless 'Duets II'|author=Considine, J.

Broadway showed little interest in the play (following the failure of Paul Simon's ''[[The Capeman]]''), and it ran only for six weeks in Miami. He released an album of songs from the musical in 1998.\n\nIn August 2000, Buffett and the Coral Reefer Band played on the White House lawn for then-President [[Bill Clinton]].\n\nIn 2003, he partnered in a partial [[duet]] with [[Alan Jackson]] for the song \"[[It's Five O'Clock Somewhere (song)|It's Five O'Clock Somewhere]]\", a number-one hit on the country charts.

With this, Buffett topped the U.S. pop albums chart for the first time in his  career.\n\nBuffett continues to tour every year, although he has shifted recently to a more relaxed schedule of around 20\u201330 dates, with infrequent back-to-back nights, preferring to play only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This schedule provided the title of his [[Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays|1999 live album]].\n\nIn the summer of 2005, Buffett teamed up with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and introduced [[Radio Margaritaville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siriusxm.com/channellineup# |title=Channel Lineup \u2013 SiriusXM Radio |publisher=Siriusxm.com |access-date=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Until this point, Radio Margaritaville was solely an online channel. Radio Margaritaville has remained on the service through Sirius' merger with [[XM Radio]] and currently appears as XM 24. The channel broadcasts from the Margaritaville Resort Orlando in [[Kissimmee, Florida]].\n\nIn August 2006, he released the album ''[[Take the Weather with You]]''. The song \"Breathe In, Breathe Out, Move On\" on this album is in honor of the survivors of 2005's [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Buffett's rendition of \"Silver Wings\" on the same album was made as a tribute to [[Merle Haggard]].

In response, the producers approached Buffett and told him that Wouk needed to be fired and a more experienced playwright needed to rewrite Wouk's script.  Buffett refused to remove Wouk from the project and any further productions of the show were canceled.  Buffett turned the show into an [[Don't Stop the Carnival (Jimmy Buffett album)|album]] that was released in 1998.\n\nA new musical, ''[[Escape to Margaritaville]]'', opened at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in [[San Diego]] in May 2017 and ran until July.  The show then performed limited runs in [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], and [[Chicago]], and was well received by critics. The show features a book by [[Greg Garcia (producer)|Greg Garcia]] and [[Mike O'Malley]] and uses Buffett's classic songs, some of which he rewrote the lyrics to in order to better fit in the context of the story. The show began previews at the [[Marquis Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on February 16, 2018, and officially opened on March 15 under the direction of [[Tony Award|Tony]] winner [[Christopher Ashley]]. The Broadway production received mixed reviews from New York critics. In June that same year, the producers announced that the production would close on July 1 after 29 previews and 124 regular performances.

The concert was Buffett's response to the [[BP]] oil disaster in the Gulf. The concert was aired on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] television. The 35,000 free tickets were given away within minutes to help draw people back to Alabama's beaches. Buffett played several popular songs including \"Fins\", \"Son of a Son of a Sailor\", \"A Pirate Looks at Forty\" and modified versions of \"Margaritaville\" (where the lyrics were changed in the chorus to \"now I know, it's all BP's fault\") and \"When the Coast is Clear\" (the lyrics in the chorus also referencing the Deepwater Horizon disaster: \"That's when it always happens / When greed and crude collide\"). The concert featured [[Jesse Winchester]] and [[Allen Toussaint]].\n\n==Controversies==\nThe earliest controversy with Buffett was his recording of \"[[God's Own Drunk]]\" on the album ''[[Living and Dying in 3/4 Time]]''. In 1983, the son of the late entertainer [[Lord Buckley]] sued Buffett for $11 million for copyright infringement, claiming that Buffett took parts of the monologue from Buckley's ''A Tribute to Buckley'' and claimed it as his own work in \"God's Own Drunk\". The suit also alleged that Buffett's \"blasphemous\" rendition presented to the public a distorted impression of Lord Buckley.<ref>\"Jimmy Buffett Sued Over Song\" ''Miami Herald'' August 30, 1983: 1A.</ref> A court injunction against Buffett prevented him from performing the song until the lawsuit was settled or resolved, so starting in 1983, Buffett would get to the part of his show where he would normally perform \"God's Own Drunk\", he would say that he was not allowed to play it because of the lawsuit and instead played a song he wrote called \"The Lawyer and the Asshole\" in which he accuses Buckley's son and lawyers of being greedy and tells them to \"kiss his ass.\"\n\nIn January 1996, Buffett's [[Grumman HU-16]] airplane named ''[[Hemisphere Dancer]]'' was shot at by Jamaican police, who believed the craft to be smuggling marijuana. The aircraft sustained minimal damage. The plane was carrying Buffett, as well as [[U2]]'s [[Bono]], his wife and two children, and [[Island Records]] producer [[Chris Blackwell]], and co-pilot Bill Dindy.
