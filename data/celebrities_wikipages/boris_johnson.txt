He previously served as [[Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and as [[Mayor of London]] from 2008 to 2016. Johnson has been [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since 2015, having previously been MP for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 2001 to 2008.\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, early political career, mayoralty and tenure as foreign secretary-->\nJohnson attended [[Eton College]], and studied [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]]. He was elected [[List of presidents of the Oxford Union|president of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. In 1989, he became the Brussels correspondent \u2014 and later political columnist \u2014 for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', and from 1999 to 2005 was the editor of ''[[The Spectator]]''. Following his election to parliament in 2001 he was a [[shadow minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. In 2008, Johnson [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected mayor of London]] and resigned from the House of Commons; he was [[2012 London mayoral election|re-elected mayor in 2012]]. At the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] he was elected MP for [[Uxbridge]] and [[South Ruislip]], and the following year did not seek re-election as mayor. Johnson became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]] in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 European Union (EU) membership referendum]]. [[Theresa May]] [[Boris Johnson's tenure as Foreign Secretary|appointed him foreign secretary]] after the referendum; he resigned the position two years later in protest at the [[Chequers Agreement]] and May's approach to Brexit.\n\n<!--Prime minister-->\nJohnson defeated [[Jeremy Hunt]] in the [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|Conservative Party leadership election]] to succeed May, who resigned after [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]'s repeated rejections of her [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. After he was appointed prime minister, Johnson [[Brexit negotiations in 2019|re-opened Brexit negotiations]] and in early September [[2019 British prorogation controversy|controversially prorogued Parliament]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] later that month ruled the action unlawful.{{efn|name=prorogationtechnicality|Formally, Parliament is prorogued by the monarch (at the time Queen [[Elizabeth&nbsp;II]]) on the advice of the prime minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the prime minister are formally carried out by the monarch on the prime minister's \"[[Advice (constitutional law)|advice]]\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the prime minister carries out the function.

On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the EU, entering into a transition period and [[Trade negotiation between the UK and the EU|trade negotiations]] that led to the [[EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement]].\n\nA decisive event that shaped [[Premiership of Boris Johnson|Johnson's premiership]] was the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom|COVID-19 pandemic]]; [[British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic|the government responded]] by introducing various [[Coronavirus Act 2020|emergency powers]] and measures across society to mitigate the pandemic's impact, and approved the rollout of a [[COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom|nationwide vaccination programme]]. He responded to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] by imposing [[International sanctions during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|sanctions on Russia]] and authorising [[List of foreign aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War|foreign aid and weapons shipments]] to Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-06-29 |title=UK Gives \u00a31 Billion to Ukraine to Help Fund Offensive Operations |language=en |work=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-29/uk-gives-1-billion-to-ukraine-to-help-fund-offensive-operations |access-date=2022-07-07}}</ref> Amid the [[Partygate]] scandal, Johnson became the first prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law while in office after being issued a [[fixed penalty notice]] in April 2022 for breaching COVID-19 regulations during [[COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom|lockdowns]]. The publishing of the [[Sue Gray report]] in May 2022 and a widespread sense of dissatisfaction led in June 2022 to a [[2022 vote of confidence in the Conservative Party leadership of Boris Johnson|vote of confidence]] in his leadership among Conservative MPs, which he won. In July 2022, revelations over his [[Chris Pincher scandal|appointment of Chris Pincher]] as Deputy Chief Whip led to a [[July 2022 United Kingdom government crisis|mass resignation of ministers from his government]] and to Johnson announcing his resignation. He left office on 6 September and was succeeded by [[Liz Truss]], his foreign secretary.
