He also served as the chairman of the [[Republican National Committee|Republican National Committee (RNC)]] from 2011 to 2017.\n\nRaised in [[Wisconsin]], Priebus graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater|University of Wisconsin-Whitewater]] and [[University of Miami School of Law]] in 1998.
