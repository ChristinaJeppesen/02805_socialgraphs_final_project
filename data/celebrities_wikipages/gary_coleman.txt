Coleman was the highest-paid [[child actor]] on television throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. He was rated first on a list of [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Kid Stars\".<ref name=\"reuters\" />\n\nColeman was best known for playing the role of [[Arnold Jackson (character)|Arnold Jackson]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1978\u20131986), which he reprised in numerous other television series such as ''[[Hello, Larry]]'' (1979), ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' (1979\u20131980) and ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' (1996), among others. For playing the role of Arnold, he received several accolades, which include two [[Young Artist Award]]s; in 1980 for [[Young Artist Award|Outstanding Contribution to Youth Through Entertainment]] and in 1982 for Best Young Actor in a Comedy Series; and three [[People's Choice Awards]]; a consecutive three wins for [[People's Choice Awards|Favorite Young TV Performer]] from 1980 to 1983; as well as nominations for two [[TV Land Award]]s.\n\nColeman's stardom resulted in several roles thereafter, including his film debut ''[[On the Right Track]]'' (1981), the comedies ''[[Jimmy the Kid]]'' and ''[[The Kid with the Broken Halo]]'' (both released in 1982), the [[cult film]] [[Dirty Work (1998 film)|''Dirty Work'']] (1998), the satirical-comedy film ''[[An American Carol]]'' (2008) and the independent film ''[[Midgets vs. Mascots]]'' (2009). He was the star of ''[[The Gary Coleman Show]]'' (1982) where he voiced Andy LeBeau, and he additionally provided the voice of Kevin in the animated show ''[[Waynehead]]'' (1996\u20131997). He also starred in the video games ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'' (1997) and did some voice acting and motion capture for ''[[Postal 2]]'' (2003).\n\nColeman struggled financially in later life; in 1989, he successfully sued his parents and business adviser over misappropriation of his assets, only to declare bankruptcy a decade later. Very few details of Coleman's medical history have been made public, although his battles with issues such as [[growth deficiency]], [[substance abuse]], and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] during his life earned significant media coverage.\n\nColeman died at [[Utah Valley Regional Medical Center]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Utah]] on May 28, 2010, aged 42. He had been admitted two days earlier after falling down the stairs at his home in Santaquin and striking his head, resulting in an [[epidural hematoma]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Early life ==\nGary Wayne Coleman was born<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/obituaries/Obituary-Gary-Coleman-actor.6329572.jp |title=Scotsman obituary |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= May 31, 2010|access-date=August 11, 2010 |location=Edinburgh}}</ref> in [[Zion, Illinois|Zion]], [[Illinois]], on February 8, 1968.

Tracy Fields, a Los Angeles bus driver and fan of Coleman's work on ''Diff'rent Strokes'', approached him in a California mall and requested his autograph, while Coleman was shopping for a [[bulletproof vest]]. When Coleman refused to give her an autograph, an argument ensued, and Fields reportedly mocked Coleman's lackluster acting career.
