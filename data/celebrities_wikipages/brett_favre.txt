Favre had 321 consecutive starts from 1992 to 2010, including 297 regular season games, the [[List of most consecutive starts and games played by National Football League players|most in league history]]. He was also the first NFL quarterback to obtain 70,000 yards, 10,000 passes, 6,000 completions, 500 touchdowns, 200 wins, and victories over all 32 teams.\n\nFavre played [[college football]] at [[University of Southern Mississippi|Southern Miss]] and was selected in the second round of the [[1991 NFL Draft]] by the [[Atlanta Falcons]], where he spent one season as a backup. Traded to the Packers, he became their starter early in the 1992 season and revitalized a franchise that had been in a period of decline since the late 1960s. During his 16 seasons with Green Bay, he led the team to 11 playoff appearances, seven division titles, four [[NFC Championship Game]]s, two consecutive [[Super Bowl]] appearances, and one championship title in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] over the [[New England Patriots]], the team's first in nearly three decades. Favre was traded in 2008 to the [[New York Jets]], where he played one year, and spent his final two seasons with the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. His 2009 campaign for the Vikings saw him guide them to a division title and NFC Championship Game appearance, while having one of his strongest statistical seasons.\n\nAt the time of his retirement, Favre was the NFL leader in [[List of National Football League passing yards leaders|passing yards]], [[List of National Football League passing touchdowns leaders|passing touchdowns]], and [[List of National Football League career quarterback wins leaders|quarterback wins]].

And the Packers concluded that it would be the mother of all mistakes if Aaron Rodgers got away without being properly evaluated as a starter. Favre had one chance, and one chance only, to salvage his career in Green Bay. He had to commit wholeheartedly for another season by early March. One could argue that the Packers erred by asking Favre for an answer that early. But having been hung out to dry by Favre too often in the past, they were in no mood for drama.\" There was also miscommunication between the Packers and Favre, as admitted by General Manager [[Ted Thompson]], \"when Favre decided in March that he was leaning toward playing, the organization wasn't quick toward embracing him\".<ref name=\"usatoday.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2018/08/07/brett-favre-trade-green-bay-packers-new-york-jets/928127002/ |title=Remembering the strange moment the Packers traded Brett Favre, 10 years ago today |first=J.
