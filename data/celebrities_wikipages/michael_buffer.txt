He began the process of obtaining a federal trademark for the phrase in the 1980s, acquiring it in 1992.

The exclusivity of his contract with WCW prevented Buffer from announcing for other wrestling-type organizations, forcing him to stop announcing for the UFC (his only UFC cards were UFC 6 and UFC 7). However, when WCW ceased to exist, and Time Warner had no more affiliation with professional wrestling, Buffer was enabled to announce in other wrestling promotions. During the [[Monday Night Wars]], while Buffer was on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] wrestler [[Triple H]] created the phrase \"Let's get ready to suck it!\" to mock him, as part of his [[D-Generation X]] gimmick.\n\nOn ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV]]'', for the first time in more than six years, Buffer returned to pro-wrestling ring announcing duties at [[Madison Square Garden]] in a boxing match between pro boxer [[Evander Holyfield]] (who was substituting for [[Montel Vontavious Porter]]) and pro wrestler [[Matt Hardy]]. Buffer appears in the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble 2008]] commercial, in which he begins to say \"Let's get ready to rumble!\" only to be [[superkick]]ed by [[Shawn Michaels]], causing him to fall over.
