From 1976 to 1982, he developed his on-air personality through morning positions at [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York]]; [[WCCC (FM)|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; [[WLLZ (FM)|WWWW]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; and [[WWDC-FM|WWDC]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] He worked afternoons at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York City from 1982 until his firing in 1985.

In recent years, Stern's photography has been featured in ''[[Hamptons (magazine)|Hamptons]]'' and ''[[WHIRL Magazine|WHIRL]]'' magazines.
