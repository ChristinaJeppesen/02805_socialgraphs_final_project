He sacrificed a large [[ox]], and divided it into two piles. In one pile he put all the meat and most of the fat, covering it with the ox's grotesque stomach, while in the other pile, he dressed up the bones with fat. Prometheus then invited Zeus to choose; Zeus chose the pile of bones. This set a precedent for sacrifices, where humans will keep the fat for themselves and burn the bones for the gods.\n\nZeus, enraged at Prometheus's deception, prohibited the use of fire by humans. Prometheus, however, stole fire from Olympus in a fennel stalk and gave it to humans. This further enraged Zeus, who punished Prometheus by binding him to a cliff, where an eagle constantly ate Prometheus's liver, which regenerated every night. Prometheus was eventually freed from his misery by [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:507-544 507-565]</ref>\n\nNow Zeus, angry at humans, decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given. He commands [[Hephaestus]] to mold from earth the first woman, a \"beautiful evil\" whose descendants would torment the human race. After Hephaestus does so, several other gods contribute to her creation. [[Hermes]] names the woman '[[Pandora]]'.\n\nPandora was given in marriage to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus]]. Zeus gave her a [[Pandora's box|jar]] which contained many evils. Pandora opened the jar and released all the evils, which made mankind miserable.

Their quadrennial [[festival]] featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\n\nOutside of the major inter-[[polis]] sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of [[Greek temple]]s from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Sicily]]. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\n\n====Zeus Velchanos====\n\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed,<ref>Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, New York: Simon & Schuster) 1939:23.</ref> and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\",<ref>Rodney Castleden, ''Minoans: Life in Bronze-Age Crete'', \"The Minoan belief-system\" (Routledge) 1990:125</ref> whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an [[epithet]] by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as '''Zeus Velchanos''' (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the ''[[Kouros]]''.\n\nIn [[Crete]], Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at [[Knossos]], [[Mount Ida, Crete|Ida]] and [[Palaikastro]]. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the [[Hagia Triada]] site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from [[Phaistos]] show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees.<ref>Pointed out by Bernard Clive Dietrich, ''The Origins of Greek Religion'' (de Gruyter) 1973:15.</ref> On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage.<ref>A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' Cambridge University Press, 1914, I, figs 397, 398.</ref> Inscriptions at [[Gortyn]] and Lyttos record a ''Velchania'' festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.<ref>Dietrich 1973, noting [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' 1950:551 and notes.</ref>\n\nThe stories of [[Minos]] and [[Epimenides]] suggest that these caves were once used for [[Incubation (ritual)|incubatory]] divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ''ho megas kouros'', \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the [[Labyrinth]] at [[Knossos]] by [[Sir Arthur Evans]].<ref>\"Professor [[Stylianos Alexiou]] reminds us that there were other divine boys who survived from the religion of the pre-Hellenic period \u2014 [[Linos]], [[Ploutos]] and [[Dionysos]] \u2014 so not all the young male deities we see depicted in Minoan works of art are necessarily Velchanos\" (Castleden) 1990:125</ref> With the [[Kouretes]], a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan ''[[paideia]]''.\n\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, [[Callimachus]],<ref>Richard Wyatt Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'', (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1968:204, mentions that there is no classical reference to the death of Zeus (noted by Dietrich 1973:16 note 78).</ref> together with the assertion of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a [[Bees (mythology)|mythic swarm of bees]], suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.<ref>\"This annually reborn god of vegetation also experienced the other parts of the vegetation cycle: holy marriage and annual death when he was thought to disappear from the earth\" (Dietrich 1973:15).</ref>\nThe Hellenistic writer [[Euhemerus]] apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of [[Crete]] and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian [[patristic]] writers took up the suggestion.\n\n====Zeus Lykaios====\n{{details|Lykaia}}\n\n[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of Zeus on a gold [[stater]], [[Lampsacus]], c 360\u2013340 BC ([[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]]).]]\nThe epithet '''Zeus Lykaios''' (\u039b\u03cd\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the [[Lykaia]] on the slopes of [[Lycaeus|Mount Lykaion]] (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadia]]; Zeus had only a formal connection<ref>In the founding myth of [[Lycaon (king of Arcadia)|Lycaon]]'s banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice, perhaps one of his sons, [[Nyctimus]] or [[Arcas]].

Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\n\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that ''Lykaios'' or ''Lykeios'' (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"twilight\", {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"year\" (lit. \"light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as [[Achaeus of Eretria|Achaeus]], the contemporary tragedian of [[Sophocles]], spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by [[Cicero]]. Again under this new signification may be seen [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).<ref>A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p.63, Cambridge University Press</ref>[[File:Statue of Zeus.jpg|thumb|A statue of Zeus in a drawing.]]\n\n====Additional cults of Zeus====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2021}}\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored '''Zeus Meilichios''' (\u039c\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03af\u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had '''Zeus Chthonios''' (\"earthy\"), '''Zeus Katachthonios''' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; \"under-the-earth\") and '''Zeus Plousios''' (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did [[chthonic]] deities like [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], and also the [[hero]]es at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\n\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the ''daimon'' to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in [[Boeotia]] might belong to the hero [[Trophonius]] or to '''Zeus Trephonius''' (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], or [[Strabo]]. The hero [[Amphiaraus]] was honored as '''Zeus Amphiaraus''' at Oropus outside of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and the Spartans even had a shrine to '''Zeus Agamemnon'''. Ancient [[Molossians|Molossian]] kings sacrificed to '''[[Zeus Areius]]''' (\u0391\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2). [[Strabo]] mention that at [[Tralles]] there was the '''Zeus Larisaeus''' (\u039b\u03b1\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2).<ref>[[Strabo]], ''[[Geographica]]'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D42 14.1.42].</ref> In [[Ithome]], they honored the '''Zeus Ithomatas''', they had a sanctuary and a statue of Zeus and also held an annual festival in honour of Zeus which was called Ithomaea (\u1f30\u03b8\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1).<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D33%3Asection%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece, 4.33.2]</ref>\n\n==== Hecatomphonia ====\nHecatomphonia ({{lang-grc|\u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1}}), meaning killing of a hundred, from \u1f11\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd \u201ca hundred\u201d and \u03c6\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03cd\u03c9 \u201cto kill\u201d.

With the epithet '''Zeus [[Aetnaeus]]''' he was worshiped on [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]], where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor.<ref>Schol. ''ad Pind.

As '''Zeus Aeneius''' or '''Zeus Aenesius''' (\u0391\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), he was worshiped in the island of [[Cephalonia]], where he had a temple on [[Mount Ainos|Mount Aenos]].<ref>Hesiod, according to a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes. ''Argonautika'', ii. 297</ref>\n\n===Oracles of Zeus===\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to [[Apollo]], the heroes, or various goddesses like [[Themis]], a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as [[Ba\u02bfal]]'s at [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]], were [[interpretatio graeca|associated]] with Zeus in Greek or [[Jupiter]] in Latin.\n\n====The Oracle at Dodona====\n\nThe cult of Zeus at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]], where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called ''Selloi'', who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches.<ref>''Odyssey'' 14.326-7</ref> By the time [[Herodotus]] wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called [[peleiades]] (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\n\nZeus' consort at Dodona was not [[Hera]], but the goddess [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]] \u2014 whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\n\n==== The Oracle at Siwa ====\nThe [[oracle of Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: [[Herodotus]] mentions consultations with [[Zeus Ammon]] in his account of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at [[Sparta]], where a temple to him existed by the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D18 3.18].</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a [[Libyan Sibyl]].\n\n==Zeus and foreign gods==\n[[File:Evolution of Zeus Nikephoros on Indo-Greek coinage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Evolution of ''Zeus Nikephoros'' (\"Zeus holding [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]]\") on [[Indo-Greek]] coinage: from the Classical motif of Nike handing the [[wreath]] of victory to Zeus himself (left, coin of [[Heliocles I]] 145-130 BC), then to a baby [[elephant]] (middle, coin of [[Antialcidas]] 115-95 BC), and then to the [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]], symbol of [[Buddhism]] (right, coin of [[Menander II]] 90\u201385 BC).]] \n[[File:Buddha-Vajrapani-Herakles.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Vajrap\u0101ni as Herakles or Zeus|Zeus as [[Vajrap\u0101ni]], the protector of the [[Buddha]]. 2nd century, [[Greco-Buddhist art]].<ref>\"In the art of Gandhara Zeus became the inseparable companion of the Buddha as Vajrapani.\" in Freedom, Progress, and Society, K.
