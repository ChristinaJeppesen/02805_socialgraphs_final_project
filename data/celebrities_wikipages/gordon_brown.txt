He previously served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Tony Blair]]'s [[Premiership of Tony Blair|government]] from 1997 to 2007, and was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1983 to 2015, first for [[Dunfermline East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline East]] and later for [[Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (UK Parliament constituency)|Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath]]. He is the most recent Labour politician as well as the most recent Scottish politician to hold the office of prime minister.\n\nA [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral graduate]], Brown studied history at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he was elected [[Rector of the University of Edinburgh|Rector]] in 1972. He spent his early career working as both a lecturer at a [[further education]] college and a television journalist. Brown was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1983 as the MP for Dunfermline East, later becoming the MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath in 2005. He joined the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Shadow Cabinet]] in 1989 as [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Shadow Secretary of State for Trade]], and was later promoted to become [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1992. After Labour's victory in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], its largest [[Landslide victory|landslide]] general election victory in history, Brown was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer, becoming the longest-serving holder of that office in modern history.\n\n[[Chancellorship of Gordon Brown|Brown's time as chancellor]] was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, transferring interest rate setting powers to the [[Bank of England]], by a wide extension of the powers of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] to cover much domestic policy and by transferring responsibility for banking supervision to the [[Financial Services Authority]]. Brown presided over the longest period of sustained economic growth in British history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/Our_Society_Today/News_Articles_2005/economy.aspx?ComponentId=8723&SourcePageId=11412 |title=Budgeting for stable economic growth |website=www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528071333/http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/CP/Our_Society_Today/News_Articles_2005/economy.aspx?ComponentId=8723&SourcePageId=11412 |archive-date=28 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/publicfinances/story/0,,1439789,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=His record \u2013 304 years and counting | first=Julian | last=Glover | date=17 March 2005 | access-date=28 April 2010 | archive-date=22 September 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922223719/http://society.guardian.co.uk/publicfinances/story/0,,1439789,00.html | url-status=live }}</ref> He outlined [[five economic tests]], which resisted [[United Kingdom and the euro|the UK adopting the euro currency]].

Under Brown, the party continued to use the campaign label [[New Labour]].

It has been suggested that visual difficulties have contributed to Brown's supposed antisocial nature and awkward public manner. For example, both on a podium and before a camera, while reading \"he needs to look slightly to one side of the paper to focus; when speaking to an audience or into a camera lens, he must remember to correct what would normally be an automatic tendency to look slightly askew to see clearly with his good eye\". Brown's papers were prepared in capital letters and in extremely large type, resulting in his stack of papers at the dispatch box being noticeably bulky. Former staffers often attributed Brown's outbursts of temper in Downing Street to his frustration with his visual limitations. Nevertheless, it is noted that he has never allowed these limitations to hold him back and in fact attributed them to the shaping of his political character.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Gordon Brown's loss of an eye informs his view of the world |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 October 2009 |url=http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/11/gordon-brown-eye-check-questions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228234013/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/11/gordon-brown-eye-check-questions |archive-date=28 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nBrown is a supporter of Kirkcaldy-based football club [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] and has written articles about his relationship with the club.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=Gordon |date=6 August 2000 |title=My team: Raith Rovers |work=The Observer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/06/newsstory.sport20 |url-status=live |access-date=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903013531/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/aug/06/newsstory.sport20 |archive-date=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Smith |first=Aidan |date=5 April 2014 |title=Gordon Brown, Raith Rovers' most famous fan |work=The Scotsman |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/raith-rovers/gordon-brown-raith-rovers-most-famous-fan-1-3366228 |url-status=live |access-date=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903082114/https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/raith-rovers/gordon-brown-raith-rovers-most-famous-fan-1-3366228 |archive-date=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=9 May 2009 |title=Gordon Brown: Holding true to my Raith |work=The Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/gordon-brown-holding-true-to-my-raith-1681757.html |url-status=live |access-date=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903014937/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/gordon-brown-holding-true-to-my-raith-1681757.html |archive-date=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=Gordon |date=9 May 2009 |title=Exclusive: Prime Minister Gordon Brown on missing Raith Rovers' league win |work=Daily Record |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/exclusive-prime-minister-gordon-brown-1022039 |url-status=live |access-date=2 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903045714/https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/exclusive-prime-minister-gordon-brown-1022039 |archive-date=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nA son of a [[Church of Scotland]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]], Brown has talked about what he calls his \"[[Morality|moral compass]]\"<ref>{{Cite news |date=25 June 2007 |title=Gordon Brown: 'I joined this party as a teenager&nbsp;...
