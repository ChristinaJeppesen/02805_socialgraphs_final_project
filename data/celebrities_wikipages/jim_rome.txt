Fans fall for Rome, big time |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |date=April 23, 1993}}</ref> At the end of 1990, he moved to XTRA Sports 690 in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], where he started what is now known as ''The Jim Rome Show'', or \"The Jungle,\" with a loop of the instrumental intro of [[Iggy Pop]]'s song \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\" and the instrumental intro of [[Guns N' Roses]]' song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\" as the show's signature music.\n\nThe show's production moved to a studio in downtown Los Angeles in spring 1994, though the broadcast was still originated by XTRA San Diego. At the same time as the studio move, the show start time shifted to 9am Pacific/12pm Eastern, where it remains as of 2022. The program was [[radio syndication|syndicated]] in 1996 through [[Premiere Radio Networks]], which sold it to an assortment of local stations including [[ESPN Radio]] affiliates. A new contract that took effect in January 2013 brought the program to the [[CBS Sports Radio]] network, which simulcasts the program on its local FM/AM stations, its [[SiriusXM]] satellite channel, and its cable TV channel.\n\nOver time, the show's production facility moved to the Premiere Radio building in [[Sherman Oaks]], then an undisclosed Orange County location, and finally, as part of the start of TV simulcasting in January 2018, a custom-built studio in [[Costa Mesa]]. Due to past incidents of the studio being invaded by callers, the exact addresses of the former and current Orange County studios are not publicized. To provide continuity across the show's eras in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange County, it is consistently referred to as originating from \"Southern California.\" In 2005, the TV versions of the show were criticized for obscuring the studio's location by using the \"Southern California\" terminology and footage of the downtown Los Angeles skyline despite originating almost 40 miles away in the Costa Mesa area.\n\nThe radio show is heard on more than 200 stations across the United States and Canada and has an audience of approximately 2.5 million.<ref name=\"AskMen\"/> In 1998, Rome released an album entitled ''Welcome to the Jungle'', which featured memorable [[sound bites]] and music from the show.\n\nIn early 2003, Rome was interviewing friend [[Mark Shapiro (media executive)|Mark Shapiro]], executive producer of programming and production at ESPN, on his radio program. Unexpectedly, the two began to discuss a possible return of Rome to ESPN, and within a few months, Rome was officially rehired to host ''Rome Is Burning.'' Rome  openly attributes that interview as the impetus to his return to television.\n\n== Controversy and incidents ==\n\nRome gained notoriety in 1994 for an incident on his [[ESPN2]] television show, ''[[Talk2]]'', when his guest was [[National Football League|NFL]] [[quarterback]] [[Jim Everett]]. Rome had often referred to Everett on radio as \"Chris\" (after [[Chris Evert]], the female tennis player), suggesting that Everett was less than a man whenever he shied away from getting hit.  Everett appeared as a guest on the television show, where he warned Rome about repeating the insult.  Rome continued to address Everett as \"Chris\" and Everett overturned the table between them and shoved Rome to the floor while still on the air. Their confrontation resulted in no legal action, although Rome publicly apologized to Everett. Rome considers that event one of his early career mistakes.<ref name=rome_everett_beaver>{{cite news|last=Conley|first=Cecil|title=Jim Rome Back for ESPN Encore|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8aI1AAAAIBAJ&pg=1365,922437|access-date=June 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Beaver County Times]]|date=May 1, 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, hockey legend [[Gordie Howe]] announced an attempt to play a shift with the [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|International Hockey League]]'s [[Detroit Vipers]], which would allow Howe to claim having played professional hockey in six decades. Rome challenged the 69-year-old ex-hockey star, offering a bounty of $3,000 to any player on the team playing against the Vipers to take Howe out of the game permanently by saying, \"Putting this old fool back to reality.\"  Rome clarified that the statements were a joke.<ref name=rj_howe>{{cite news|title=A bounty on Howe?

During an interview, Rome asked Stern about the conspiracy theories that the NBA Draft Lottery was fixed in favor of the [[New Orleans Hornets]], and he asked, \"Was the fix in for the lottery?\" Stern replied with two answers: \"Number one, no; and a statement, shame on you for asking.\" He then proceeded to ask Rome the [[loaded question]] example of \"Have you stopped beating your wife yet?\" and accused Rome of \"making a career out of cheap thrills\". This led to a heated exchange between Rome and Stern, ending when Stern said he had \"to go call someone important like [[Stephen A.
