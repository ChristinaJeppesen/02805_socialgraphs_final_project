You can learn journalism in four weeks. It's not an overcomplicated thing. It's very simple.\"<ref name=news/>\n\nLoder lived in Europe for the next several years, doing what he later called \"scandal sheet\" \"[[yellow journalism]].\"<ref name=news/> He returned home to [[New Jersey]] at the end of 1972 and worked with a local newspaper and then an Ocean City-based magazine run by the sister of the city's famous writer [[Gay Talese]]. He left in the summer of 1976 to work with a free [[Long Island]] rock weekly called ''Good Times''. He received about $200 a week.<ref name= circus/>\n\nAfter meeting a fellow \"music geek,\" [[David Fricke]], \"the two of us began driving into Manhattan virtually every night to wallow in the flourishing punk rock scene at CBGB's, Max's, etc. This was, fortunately, cool with the wives. I mean, we'd still be sitting upright at four in the morning through fist fights, mass nod-outs, and sets by bands with names like Blinding Headache, played to audiences of three people, of which we'd be two-thirds. I don't think I can quite convey how great days those were\".<ref name= circus/>\n\nThey both joined ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' in 1978 and moved to [[Manhattan]]. Loder went on to become one of its official editors. The staff had a fun, relaxed atmosphere and considered the magazine to be second or third tier. Loder later said that \"Whatever was said to be 'happening' in commercial pop music was... on the cover of Circus. Disco? Run with it. Shirtless teen popsters? Put 'em on the cover... a, shall we say, ardent enthusiasm for pix of nubile youths. Metal, of course, was really the mag's meat.\" He also remarked that \"it was a foregone conclusion that writing of any technical ambition, about new acts of any real excitement or interest, would make it in the mag only by the sheerest accident.\" Loder briefly experimented with [[inhalant]]-based [[recreational drug use|drugs]] at ''Circus''; he stopped after experiencing a \"gushing\" [[nosebleed]] without any feeling left in his face.<ref name= circus/>\n\nLoder started a nine-year run at ''Rolling Stone'' in May 1979. RockCritics.com has called him \"one of ''Rolling Stone'''s most talented and prolific feature writers.\"<ref name=circus/> While at ''Rolling Stone'', Loder co-authored singer [[Tina Turner's]] 1986 autobiography ''[[I, Tina]]''.

The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or something and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.<ref name=ocean/></blockquote>\n\nIn a 1989 live show, Loder saw [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] front man [[Sebastian Bach]] wearing a T-shirt reading the anti-gay slogan \"AIDS Kills Fags Dead.\" Loder reacted with an article in which he stated, \"In the land of homophobia, if [[Axl Rose]] owns the restaurant and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] are the diners, we have a new busboy.\" Bach considered Loder's words \"complete bullshit,\" saying that he had only used the shirt to dry himself off and strongly opposes the message on it, and later issued several public apologies.<ref name=bach>[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BlabberMouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=60702  \"SEBASTIAN BACH Says He Lied When He Said He'd Stopped Drinking\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121072308/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=60702 |date=January 21, 2008 }}.

It's not a good thing to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to consider you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, and you just have to fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad.
