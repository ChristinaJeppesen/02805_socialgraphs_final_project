Duffy returned to reprise his role as Bobby in a [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|continuation of ''Dallas'']], which aired on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] from 2012 to 2014.

Following the series' cancellation in early 1978, he got his big break in the role of [[Bobby Ewing]], opposite Barbara Bel Geddes and Larry Hagman, on the prime-time soap opera ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.<ref name=tvg/> The show became a worldwide success. Despite its success, Duffy opted to leave the series in 1985 with his character being killed off onscreen. However, with both the show and his career on the decline, he returned in 1986 in the infamous [[Dallas (1978 TV series)#Cliffhangers|shower scene]] that rendered the entire 1985\u20131986 season \"just a dream.\" Duffy then remained with the series until its cancellation in 1991. He also appeared in several episodes of the spin-off series ''[[Knots Landing]]'' between 1979 and 1982. Throughout the 13-year run of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', Duffy directed several episodes of the series. \nAlong with ''Dallas'' fame, Duffy has also tried his hand at singing, and in 1983, he had a hit in Europe with \"Together We're Strong\", a duet with French female singer [[Mireille Mathieu]].<ref name=tvg/> The single reached No. 5 in the Netherlands in April 1983.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dutch Music Charts|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/weekchart.asp?cat=s&year=1983&date=19830409|website=Dutch Charts|access-date=August 15, 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Patrick Duffy & Linda Gray - Monte-Carlo Television Festival.JPG|thumb|Duffy with [[Linda Gray]] at the 2013 [[Monte-Carlo Television Festival]]]]\nAt the end of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''' run in 1991, Duffy began another television role, as Frank Lambert on the family sitcom, ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'' in which he co-starred with [[Suzanne Somers]]. The series ran until 1998, and Duffy also directed numerous episodes. Also in the 1990s, he appeared in two ''Dallas'' reunion television movies; ''[[Dallas: J.R. Returns|J.R. Returns]]'' (1996) and ''[[Dallas: War of the Ewings|War of the Ewings]]'' (1998), both of which he also co-produced. He has reunited on several occasions with many of his ''Dallas'' co-stars both onscreen and off, most notably for the non-fiction television special ''[[Dallas Reunion: Return to Southfork]]'' in 2004. Duffy later continued to act in the occasional guest or voice acting appearance, including the series ''[[Family Guy]]'' (in which he appeared in a [[Da Boom#Plot|live action scene]] with [[Victoria Principal]] as they spoofed the ''Dallas'' shower scene), as well as ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''. Duffy starred in the television movies ''Falling in Love With the Girl Next Door'' and ''Desolation Canyon''.  In 2006, he began a recurring role on the daytime soap opera ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' as [[Stephen Logan (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephen Logan]].

Duffy had met Bel Geddes through his future father-in-law when he was a boy. At the time of his TV mother's death, he said: <blockquote>When Barbara joined the cast of \"Dallas,\" as Miss Ellie, I considered her to be like Helen Hayes, Katherine Cornell, and Ethel Barrymore \u2014 a real \"name\" in American theater. But you'd never have known it. She exhibited no large ego because of her history. She'd schlepp in and drop your jaw with every performance \u2014 whether it was drinking a cup of coffee, having a mastectomy, or losing Jock Ewing. It was remarkable, her ordinariness despite that pedigree. We called Barbara \"BBG\" on the set. She was the mama figure. Larry Hagman was obviously the prow of the boat, but he couldn't have functioned without a strong mother, and I don't think there's been a mother like her on dramatic television since then. People related to her because she was the epitome of compassion despite her own pain. Off screen, she was a pistol. She cussed like a mule skinner, and she really liked to have her drinks. But she also had an endless capacity to include everybody that she loved, and that was the entire cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2005/12/23/patrick-duffy-remembers-barbara-bel-geddes|title=Patrick Duffy Remembers Barbara Bel Geddes|publisher=ew.com|author=Duffy, Patrick|date=December 23, 2005 |access-date=March 5, 2018}}</ref> </blockquote>Then, 7 years after his TV mother\u2019s death, at the revival of ''[[Dallas (2012 TV series)|Dallas]]'', he said: \u201cBarbara is a big piece of our history, and it's important to me to honor her. To come back with [[Linda Gray]] as [[Sue Ellen Ewing|Sue Ellen]] and Larry Hagman in his [[J. R.
