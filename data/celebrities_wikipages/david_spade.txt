Additionally, he starred as [[CJ Barnes|C. J. Barnes]] in the sitcom ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'' (2004\u20132005).

After being spotted by a talent agent while performing at [[The Improv]] in Los Angeles he was cast in the 1987 film ''[[Police Academy 4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005450/bio|title=David Spade|website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===''Saturday Night Live''===\n[[File:David Spade 1 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Spade in 2004]]\nWith the help of friend and fellow comedian [[Dennis Miller]], he joined ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1990.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Spade started as a writer and eventually moved up to cast member. While there, he became known for his brand of sarcasm, and his characters in a number of [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] were hits. Some of them include a [[flight attendant]] for \"[[Total Bastard Airlines]]\" who bids a dismissive \"Buh-Bye\" to each passenger upon disembarking; a receptionist for [[Dick Clark]] who, as a matter of policy, asks people indiscriminately, \"And you are?\"; and the quick-witted \"[[Hollywood Minute]]\" reporter who [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]] celebrities with personal [[One-line joke|one-liners]]. Other characters include Christy Henderson from the [[Gap Girls]] and Karl from the Karl's Video sketches. He also did impressions of various celebrities, including [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Michael J. Fox]]. According to interviews with Spade, most of the material that he wrote early in his time at SNL was given to [[Dana Carvey]] to perform on the show.\n\nAfter the major cast overhaul following the 1994\u20131995 season, Spade agreed to remain on the show for the 1995\u201396 season to serve as a bridge between the former cast and new cast members [[Will Ferrell]], [[Molly Shannon]], and [[Cheri Oteri]]. During this season, Spade was given a weekly segment called \"Spade in America\" which was a spin-off of his \"Hollywood Minute\" and \"Weekend Update\" commentaries.\n\nOn December 9, 1995, Spade revived \"Hollywood Minute\" inside one of his \"Spade in America\" segments; Spade joked, \"Look, children, it's a falling star. Make a wish!\" next to a picture of former ''Saturday Night Live'' cast member [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Spade in America CLIP 12/09/95 |url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/spade-in-america/n10776 |website=nbc.com |publisher=NBC |access-date=October 15, 2019 |date=December 9, 1995}}</ref> The one-liner referred to Murphy's lack of recent box office success, especially the [[Box-office bomb|bomb]] ''[[Vampire in Brooklyn]]''.

The two were planning a third film together, but Farley died of a drug overdose in 1997 at the age of 33 and thus it was cancelled. When Spade declined to attend Farley's funeral, rumors abounded that there had been a falling out between the two. Spade stated that their friendship had been under some tension, partly because of Farley's drug problem and reckless lifestyle, which Spade admittedly could not keep up with. However, it never escalated to ill will, and that the reason he did not attend the funeral was simply because he could not handle it emotionally.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Grow|first1=Kory|title=David Spade Explains Why He Didn't Attend Chris Farley's Funeral|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/david-spade-explains-why-he-didnt-attend-chris-farleys-funeral-20140430|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=February 24, 2018|date=April 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Return to television, voice work and ''Joe Dirt''===\nAlthough he received several offers to star in his own TV shows, he turned them down and joined the ensemble cast of [[Steven Levitan]]'s office sitcom ''[[Just Shoot Me!]],'' opposite [[Laura San Giacomo]] and [[George Segal]], which ran for seven seasons from 1997 to 2003. He played a sarcastic receptionist, [[Dennis Finch]].\n\nIn 2000, Spade provided the voice of Kuzco in Disney's [[Buddy film|buddy comedy]] film, ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (2000) and would later reprise the role in its direct-to-video sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' (2005).\n\nWhile appearing on ''Just Shoot Me'', Spade had his first solo starring role as the title character in the 2001 film ''[[Joe Dirt]]'', which was a modest box office success. The film was co-written by Spade and Fred Wolf.\n\n===Further film work and television hosting===\nSpade starred again in the 2003 film ''[[Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star]]'', again co-written by Spade and Wolf. It was the first of many films in which Spade has appeared that were produced by another ''Saturday Night Live'' castmate, [[Adam Sandler]]. Most notable among these are the films ''[[Grown Ups (film)|Grown Ups]]'' (2010) and ''[[Grown Ups 2]]'' (2013), both of which included Spade and Sandler among the lead roles, and both of which were major box office hits.\n\nSpade hosted both the [[Teen Choice Awards]] and [[SpikeTV]]'s [[Spike Video Game Awards|Video Game Awards]] in 2003. He voiced characters on several episodes of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' and produced his own TV series ''[[Sammy (TV series)|Sammy]]'' in 2000. From 2002 to 2006, Spade regularly appeared in commercials for [[Capital One]] (with [[Nate Torrence]]) where he played the employee of a fictional rival company whose policy toward honoring credit card rewards (and just about everything else) is \"always no\". In 2004, he joined the cast of ''[[8 Simple Rules]],'' following the death of the sitcom's star, [[John Ritter]], for the show's third and final season.\n\nIn 2018, Spade appeared in his first major dramatic role in the movie ''[[Warning Shot (2018 film)|Warning Shot]]'' co-starring [[Bruce Dern]] and [[James Earl Jones]], with Spade playing the dangerous grandson of a powerful business tycoon (Dern)\n\nHe hosted the Comedy Central TV show ''[[The Showbiz Show with David Spade]]'' for three seasons, from September 2005 to October 2007. On the show, Spade made fun of Hollywood and celebrities in a manner similar to his old \"Hollywood Minute\" segment on ''SNL''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070811085702/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/10/the_showbiz_show_with_david_spade_comedy_central_s.php The Showbiz Show with David Spade: Comedy Central Series Cancelled], ''TVSeriesFinale.com''.
