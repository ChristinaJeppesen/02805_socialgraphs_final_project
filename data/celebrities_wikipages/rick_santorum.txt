Santorum criticizes alike laissez-faire conservatives and liberal proponents of social welfare for promoting a radical view of autonomy. In particular, he criticizes the \"bigs\" \u2013 \"big government, big media, big entertainment, big universities.\" The book became a ''[[New York Times]]'' [[The New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secureapps.libraries.psu.edu/PACFTB/bios/biography.cfm?AuthorID=1530|title=Author biographies|access-date=August 10, 2015|archive-date=January 30, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130193721/https://secureapps.libraries.psu.edu/PACFTB/bios/biography.cfm?AuthorID=1530|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''American Patriots'' tells the stories of 25 lesser-known Americans from the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/49260781/ns/today-books/#.UHEk7ZG9KSM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006024006/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/49260781/ns/today-books#.UHEk7ZG9KSM |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 6, 2012 |title=Santorum cites unsung heroes of the American Revolution (book excerpt) |work=MSNBC.com |date=October 2, 2012 |author=Rick Santorum |access-date=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Santorum writes, \"Most Americans know something about our Founding Fathers and their role in creating the government of the United States.

That threat does not come from an alien force but from those who are willing and determined to abandon the concept of God-given rights.
