In [[Judaism]], Satan is seen as an agent subservient to [[God in Judaism|God]], typically regarded as a metaphor for the ''[[yetzer hara]]'', or \"evil inclination.\" In [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], he is usually seen as a [[fallen angel]] or [[jinn]] who has rebelled against [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]], who nevertheless allows him temporary power over the fallen world and a host of [[demon]]s. In the [[Quran]], '''[[Shaitan]]''', also known as '''[[Iblis]]''', is an entity made of fire who was cast out of Heaven because he refused to bow before the newly created [[Adam in Islam|Adam]] and incites humans to sin by infecting their minds with ''wasw\u0101s'' (\"evil suggestions\").\n\nA figure known as ''ha-satan'' (\"the satan\") first appears in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as a heavenly [[prosecutor]], subordinate to [[Yahweh]] (God), who prosecutes the [[Kingdom of Judah|nation of Judah]] in the heavenly court and tests the loyalty of Yahweh's followers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} During the [[intertestamental period]], possibly due to influence from the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] figure of [[Ahriman|Angra Mainyu]], the satan developed into a malevolent entity with abhorrent qualities in [[Dualism in cosmology|dualistic opposition]] to God. In the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocryphal]] [[Book of Jubilees]], Yahweh grants the satan (referred to as [[Mastema]]) authority over a [[Watcher (angel)|group of fallen angels]], or [[Nephilim|their offspring]], to tempt humans to sin and punish them.\n\nAlthough the [[Book of Genesis]] does not mention him, Christians often identify the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent in the Garden of Eden]] as Satan. In the [[Synoptic Gospels]], Satan [[Temptation of Christ|tempts Jesus in the desert]] and is identified as the cause of illness and temptation. In the [[Book of Revelation]], Satan appears as a [[Serpents in the Bible#Ancient serpent|Great Red Dragon]], who is defeated by [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] and cast down from Heaven. He is later bound for [[Millennialism|one thousand years]], but is briefly set free before being ultimately defeated and cast into the [[Lake of fire|Lake of Fire]].\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], Satan played a minimal role in [[Christian theology]] and was used as a [[comic relief]] figure in [[mystery plays]]. During the [[early modern period]], Satan's significance greatly increased as beliefs such as [[Spirit possession|demonic possession]] and [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]] became more prevalent. During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], belief in the existence of Satan was harshly criticized by thinkers such as [[Voltaire]]. Nonetheless, belief in Satan has persisted, particularly in the [[Americas]].\n\nAlthough Satan is generally viewed as evil, some groups have very different beliefs. In [[theistic Satanism]], Satan is considered a deity who is either worshipped or revered. In [[LaVeyan Satanism]], Satan is a symbol of virtuous characteristics and liberty. Satan's appearance is never described in the Bible, but, since the ninth century, he has often been shown in [[Christian art]] with horns, cloven hooves, unusually hairy legs, and a tail, often naked and holding a pitchfork. These are an amalgam of traits derived from various pagan deities, including [[Pan (god)|Pan]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Bes]]. Satan appears frequently in [[Christian literature]], most notably in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', all variants of the classic [[Faust]] story, [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and ''[[Paradise Regained]]'', and the poems of [[William Blake]]. He continues to appear in film, television, and music.\n\n==Historical development==\n\n===Hebrew Bible===\n[[File:Gustav Jaeger Bileam Engel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|''Balaam and the Angel'' (1836) by [[Gustav J\u00e4ger (painter)|Gustav J\u00e4ger]].

He is regarded as a cosmic force for separation, despair and spiritual envelopment. Muslims do distinguish between the satanic temptations and the murmurings of the bodily lower self (''[[nafs]]''). The lower self commands the person to do a specific task or to fulfill a specific desire; whereas the inspirations of Satan tempt the person to do evil in general and, after a person successfully resists his first suggestion, Satan returns with new ones.<ref>Michael Anthony Sells.
