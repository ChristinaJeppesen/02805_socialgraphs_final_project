He moved up to the [[United Midget Racing Association]] (UMRA) where he raced TQ (three quarter) midgets until 1991 when he again moved up this time to the [[United States Auto Club]] (USAC) series with the help of one of his karting sponsors and friend [[Mark Dismore]]. Stewart was the USAC Rookie of the Year in 1991, USAC National Midget Series Champion in 1994 and 1995, and USAC Silver Crown Series champion in 1988.\n\n===IndyCar and NASCAR Xfinity Series===\n[[File:Tony Stewart IndyCar Crop.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart's [[1999 Indianapolis 500]] car]]\nIn 1995, Stewart became the first driver to win USAC's version of the [[United States Auto Club#The Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], earning championships in all three of USAC's major divisions, National Midget, Sprint, and Silver Crown. His winning the [[Hut Hundred]] and 4-Crown Nationals were the highlights of the year. With the advent of the [[IndyCar Series|Indy Racing League]] (IRL), which intended to provide opportunities for grassroots racers, Stewart found his way into Indy car racing; after unsuccessful negotiations with [[A. J. Foyt Racing]], he signed early in 1996 for [[Team Menard]] as a last-minute addition for the abridged three-race initial season. In his Indy car debut at [[Walt Disney World Speedway]], Stewart led 37 laps and finished a close second to fellow rookie [[Buzz Calkins]]. He also led laps at [[Phoenix Raceway|Phoenix]] in the early stages before a myriad of pit stop woes and mechanical issues led to his retirement. \n\nFor his [[Indianapolis 500]] debut, he initially qualified on the outside of the front row, but the disqualification of [[Arie Luyendyk]]'s time and the death of his teammate [[Scott Brayton]] a week later propelled Stewart to the pole position. After leading 44 laps, his race ended before the halfway point due to a malfunctioning pop-off valve, which dropped him to 8th in the final point standings. When Stewart was not racing IndyCars, he raced stock cars, which he had signed to do beforehand. In 1996, he made his NASCAR [[Busch Series]] debut, driving for car owner Harry Rainer. In nine races, he had a best finish of 16th place. Stewart had more success in a one-time ride in the [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] with Mueller Brothers racing, where he finished 10th.\n\nStewart was poised to improve his IRL standing in the [[1996\u201397 Indy Racing League|1996-97 season]] but at times he struggled to finish. He failed to finish the first three races of a ten-race schedule, but recovered to come in second at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]]. At that year's [[Indy 500]], Stewart's car was good enough to enable him to win his first IRL race, leading 64 laps. However, he trailed off near the end of the race and settled for 5th place. He finally got his first career win at [[Pikes Peak International Raceway|Pikes Peak]], where he led all but seven laps of a 200 lap race. He became the leading contender for the series championship after a bad slump knocked points leader [[Davey Hamilton]] out of first place. Despite an average end to his season, finishing 7th, 14th, and 11th, and five DNFs, Stewart did just enough to beat Hamilton for the IRL title. He also raced in a few midget events, finishing thirteenth and eleventh in the 1997 and 1998 USAC national points, and winning the Copper Classic both years. Between his time in USAC and the IRL, Stewart earned the nickname of \"Smoke\", first for slipping the right rear tire during dirt races and then for blowing his engine often during his 1997 championship run.<ref name=\"NMARHoF\">[http://worthyofhonor.com/Inductees/Tony_Stewart.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091038/http://worthyofhonor.com/Inductees/Tony_Stewart.htm|date=September 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAs he had done the previous year, he raced a handful of Busch Series races in 1998. This time, he was racing for [[Joe Gibbs]], [[National Football League|NFL]] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]], who was having major success with [[Bobby Labonte]] in the Winston Cup Series. When Stewart was able to finish races, he finished in the top 10 and had a 3rd-place finish at Charlotte. Stewart so impressed Gibbs that he was signed to drive the majority of the Busch schedule in 1998 to go along with a full-time IRL schedule. The double duty did not affect his performance in either series. In the IRL, he won twice and finished 3rd in the championship. His season was a disappointment as he finished last in the Indy 500 because of an engine failure.\n\nOn the Busch side, he finished in the top-five five times in 22 starts. He came close to winning his first Busch Series race at [[North Carolina Speedway|Rockingham]], but was beaten on a last-lap pass by [[Matt Kenseth]]. Stewart finished a solid 2nd place in 2 (of 31) starts, ahead of six drivers with more starts, and had an average finish that was comparable to some of the series' top 10 finishers. Gibbs had enough confidence in Stewart that he was moved up to a Cup ride for the 1999 season. With that move, Stewart ended his three-year career as a full-time IRL driver.\n\nAfter transitioning to the Cup level, Stewart continued racing in the Busch Series on a part-time basis. On August 16, 2005, Stewart was fined $5,000 and placed on probation until December 31 for hitting [[Brian Vickers]] after the completion of the Busch Series Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen. He was driving a Busch car owned by [[Kevin Harvick Incorporated]] at the time.\n\nIn 2013, Stewart renewed his RCR deal to drive the No. 33 Oreos/Ritz Chevrolet. He won the opening [[2013 DRIVE4COPD 300|Nationwide Series event at Daytona]], overtaking [[Regan Smith (racing driver)|Regan Smith]] on the last lap, but his win was overshadowed by worry because Smith had been turned and in the resulting crash, [[Kyle Larson]] had flown into the catch fence, completely slicing off the front part of his car and injuring 28 spectators in the grandstands (2 critically). The next day in the [[2013 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], Stewart's day ended on lap 35 when he was caught up in an early crash with [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Kasey Kahne]]; this would allow him to finish 41st. He rebounded slightly with an 8th-place finish at Phoenix and an 11th-place finish in Las Vegas. At Bristol, Stewart blew his tire on lap 3 and cut a brake line; he came back out over 20 laps down, unable to contend for the victory.\n\nIn 2020, Stewart planned to make his return to the now-Xfinity Series for the [[Pennzoil 150]] on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's road course, but plans were called off due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Albert|first=Zack|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/04/tony-stewart-set-race-inaugural-xfinity-series-event-indianapolis/|title=Tony Stewart set to race in inaugural Xfinity Series event at Indianapolis|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=March 4, 2020|access-date=March 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Taranto|first=Steven|url=https://247sports.com/Article/Tony-Stewart-not-coming-out-of-retirement-NASCAR-Xfinity-Series-Indianapolis-Motor-Speedway-reasons-for-backing-out-148020741/|title=Tony Stewart calls off July return to NASCAR at Indianapolis|publisher=[[247Sports.com]]|date=June 9, 2020|access-date=August 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===NASCAR Cup Series===\nAfter competing part-time during the [[1996 NASCAR Busch Series]] season with the team, Stewart had planned to move up to the Winston Cup Series in 1997 driving for Ranier-Walsh Racing;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.philly.com/1996-10-05/sports/25666476_1_rick-hendrick-andy-petree-irl-race|title=A Nascar Newcomer Will Keep The Indy 500 In His Sights|last=Schnatz|first=Pete|date=October 5, 1996|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|access-date=2014-04-05|location=Philadelphia, PA}}</ref> however the deal fell through when Stewart decided he was not ready for the move.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.circletrack.com/ultimateracing/ctrp_9904_race_car_driver_tony_stewart/viewall.html|title=Race Car Driver Tony Stewart|last=Thomas|first=Michael|date=April 1, 1999|work=Circle Track|access-date=2014-04-05}}</ref>\n\n====Joe Gibbs Racing (1999\u20132008)====\n=====1999 season=====\nStewart started his NASCAR Cup career in 1999 with a bang, as he qualified his No. 20 [[The Home Depot]]-sponsored [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] on the outside pole for the [[1999 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]]. He showed courage in one of the [[Can-Am Duel|Gatorade Twin 125s]] when he was involved in a battle with [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the lead in the last laps. Though Earnhardt came out on top, Stewart had nonetheless impressed quite a few people with his performance. In the 500, Stewart ran near the front until problems with the car relegated him to a 28th-place finish.\n\nStewart spent most of his rookie season wowing people, as his car was often in the Top 5. He won a pair of pole positions at [[short track motor racing|short tracks]], and set a series record for wins by a rookie with three\u2014Richmond, Phoenix, and Homestead\u2014surpassing [[Davey Allison]]'s record set in 1987<ref name=\"Top 10 rookie campaigns\">{{cite web |last=Caraviello|first=David|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2014/1/20/top-10-nascar-rookies-tony-stewart-jimmie-johnson-dale-earnhardt.html|title=Top 10 Rookie Campaigns at NASCAR's Highest Level|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|date=January 20, 2014|access-date=January 20, 2014}}</ref> (Stewart's record would hold until 2002, when [[Jimmie Johnson]] tied the feat by winning three times; although [[Carl Edwards]] won four times in 2005, his first full Cup season, he was not regarded as a rookie by NASCAR standards because he had run more than ten Nextel Cup races in 2004). He finished his first Cup season with 3 wins, 12 top fives, 21 top tens, 2 poles, only 1 DNF, 1,226 laps led, a 10.26 average finish, and a 4th-place finish in the point standings, making it the highest points finish by a rookie in the modern era (which held until 2006 when his future teammate [[Denny Hamlin]] finished 3rd) and only bested by [[James Hylton]], who finished 2nd as a first-timer in 1966.<ref name=\"Top 10 rookie campaigns\"/> Not surprisingly, he ran away with the Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award.\n\nStewart also attempted to race {{convert|1100|mi|km}} on [[Memorial Day|Memorial Day weekend]], as he competed in both the Indy 500 during the day and the [[Coca-Cola 600]] in Charlotte, N.C., at night.

However, he fell to 6th place in the standings because of a handful of DNFs and an increase in the number of competitive drivers, among them his teammate Labonte, who won the Cup championship. Stewart also began to get some bad press for his on-track incidents. The best known of these came at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] when he and [[Jeff Gordon]] tangled and crashed. Stewart made his displeasure toward Gordon known in an obscenity-laden tirade. Stewart won the [[Turkey Night Grand Prix]] midget car event at [[Irwindale, California]], which he called, \u201cone of his greatest wins ever.\"<ref name=NMARHoF/>\n\n=====2001 season=====\nStewart got off to a scary start for the 2001 season: during the [[2001 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], he was involved in an 18-car crash on lap 173. The crash began on the back straightaway and also collected [[Bobby Labonte]] and his brother [[Terry Labonte|Terry]], [[Rusty Wallace]], [[Steve Park]], [[Jason Leffler]], [[Jerry Nadeau]], [[Buckshot Jones]], [[Andy Houston]], [[Ward Burton]], [[Mark Martin]], [[Kenny Wallace]], [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Elliott Sadler]], [[Dale Jarrett]], [[Jeff Burton]], [[John Andretti]], and [[Robby Gordon]]. Stewart took the worst of it, as his car turned backward after being hit by Ward Burton, pushed over Robby Gordon, then flipped twice in midair, hooked Bobby Labonte's hood, and came to a stop in the infield. Stewart was transported to Halifax Medical Center after complaints of discomfort in his shoulder. Stewart's crash was greatly overshadowed by [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|fatal crash on the last lap]]. Stewart recovered to win three more races at Richmond, Infineon, and Bristol and, as he had done before, he ran near the front most of the season. Statistically, he had a worse season than 2000, but he finished 2nd to Gordon in the final points standings.\n\nFor the second time, Stewart ran the \"[[Memorial Day Double]]\", in spite of a 17-minute rain delay at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]]. He finished sixth in the [[Indianapolis 500]] and third in the [[Coca-Cola 600]], running all {{convert|1100|mi|km}} of the two races.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/2001/indy500/news/2001/05/27/stewart_sunday_ap/ |title=CNNSI.com&nbsp;\u2013 2001 Indy 500&nbsp;\u2013 NASCAR's Stewart pulling double duty again |date=June 11, 2001 |work=Sports Illustrated |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe 2001 season was not without controversy. Jeff Gordon pulled a \"[[bump and run (auto racing)|bump and run]]\" on Stewart to gain a better finishing position at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]] and Stewart retaliated in a post-race incident by spinning Gordon out on pit road. Stewart was fined and placed on NASCAR [[probation]]. He got into much bigger trouble in the [[2001 Pepsi 400|Pepsi 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], where he confronted a Winston Cup official after ignoring a [[racing flags#The black flag|black flag]], which he had received for an illegal pass on [[Dave Blaney]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lipsyte|first=Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/09/sports/auto-racing-the-call-is-answered-in-earnhardt-s-pepsi-400-victory.html|title=AUTO RACING; 'The Call' Is Answered in Earnhardt's Pepsi 400 Victory|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 2001|access-date=May 4, 2014}}</ref> In the same race, he had an incident with a ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'' reporter in which he kicked away a tape recorder.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/12/sports/plus-auto-racing-further-probation-for-irate-stewart.html|title=PLUS: AUTO RACING; Further Probation For Irate Stewart|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 12, 2001|access-date=May 4, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/motorsports/nascar_plus/news/2001/07/09/stewart_grandfather_ap/|title=Stewart's grandfather died before race|work=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]]|date=July 9, 2001|access-date=May 1, 2014}}</ref> He confronted that same official during the [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]] race after he refused to wear a mandated head-and-neck restraint. Stewart was not allowed to practice until he wore one, and only managed to do so after his crew chief [[Greg Zipadelli]] intervened. Stewart's fines and periods of probation resulting from these incidents have earned him a reputation of having a hot temper, and he became known as NASCAR's \"bad boy\".\n\n=====2002 season: First Cup Championship=====\nStewart started the 2002 season even more inauspiciously than last year's, as the [[2002 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]] lasted just two laps for him due to a blown engine. He went on to win twice early in the season at Atlanta and Richmond, but he was only seventh in the points standings at the season's halfway point. At Darlington, Stewart was involved in a multi-car wreck in which [[Jimmy Spencer (racing driver)|Jimmy Spencer]]'s car t-boned Stewart's car. While Stewart was sent to the hospital following the crash, he was able to start the next race at Bristol. Due to the injuries sustained at Darlington, he was relieved during the race by [[Todd Bodine]]. The second half of his season was plagued by an altercation with a photographer after the [[Brickyard 400]]. He was fined $50,000 by NASCAR and penalized with a 25-point deduction. However, despite the controversy, he went on to win the very next week at Watkins Glen. Strangely enough, this race also ended in controversy, when it was revealed that he had jumped the restart and, despite the infraction, officials upheld Stewart's win. This win proved to be a turning point in Stewart\u2019s season; he went on a hot streak following Watkins Glen, and despite not winning any more races that season his consistent top 10 finishes, combined with his rivals running into trouble, allowed him to claim the points lead at Talledega. At the end of the season, Stewart held off [[Mark Martin]] to win his first Winston Cup championship. This was Stewart's last season driving a Pontiac.\n\n=====2003 season=====\nAs the defending champion, Stewart managed to have a relatively incident-free 2003 season. Joe Gibbs Racing changed manufacturers, so he and Labonte were now driving [[Chevrolet]]s instead of [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]]s. Stewart had his worst Cup season at this point up until 2006, but it was still good enough for seventh in the points standings. He only won two races that season at Pocono and Charlotte but he led more laps than he did last year and was highly competitive in the final races of the season.\n\n=====2004 season=====\nIn January 2004, Stewart teamed with [[Andy Wallace (racing driver)|Andy Wallace]] and Dale Earnhardt Jr. in a Boss Motorsports Chevrolet to take fourth in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] sports car endurance race. The result does not show the trio's performance, however. They had dominated the race until the last two hours when the suspension cracked. With 15 minutes left in the race and Stewart driving, one of the rear wheels came off, finally ending their run. In addition to placing fourth overall, the trio placed third in the [[Daytona Prototype]] class.\n\nStewart started on a higher note in the 2004 season as he finished second in the Gatorade 125. In the [[2004 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], he and Dale Earnhardt Jr. both dominated the race, leading 156 laps overall (98 for Stewart). Stewart was in contention to win it, only to lose the lead to Earnhardt Jr. with 20 laps to go. That would be Stewart's best finish in the Daytona 500.\n\nAt Infineon, Stewart was involved in an altercation with rookie driver [[Brian Vickers]]. On lap 88 of 110, Stewart got spun out by Vickers as retaliation for an earlier collision in the race. Stewart replied by confronting Vickers after the race and throwing a punch through Vickers' window. Stewart was fined $50,000, stripped of 25 driver & owner points, and put on probation for the rest of 2004.\n\nThe season was highlighted with Stewart's first win coming at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]]. This win was not without controversy as on a mid-race restart, he turned Kasey Kahne into the wall, which eventually led to an altercation between his and Kahne's pit crews. Stewart felt very sick during the race at Watkins Glen International and nearly withdrew from it due to food poisoning, stomach cramps, a headache, and a sinus infection. He ultimately relented and ran the race, dominating and holding off Canadian road ringer [[Ron Fellows]] for the win. He qualified fourth for the first-ever [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup]]. However, an incident at the first race of The Chase at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|Loudon]] ended his hopes of a second Cup championship. Stewart got collected in a multi-car crash, which started when Robby Gordon repaid [[Greg Biffle]] some retaliation, and Stewart t-boned Biffle. Stewart had to make repairs and lost three laps. He finished two laps down, causing him to lose his shot at his second championship. Gordon did not get off the hook however and was penalized with a $15,000 fine and a 50-point deduction for his actions.\n\nAfter losing his bid for the championship title, Stewart finished sixth in the Nextel Cup point standings.\n\nIn November 2004, Stewart became the owner of one of the most legendary short tracks in America, [[Eldora Speedway]]. Located in [[New Weston, Ohio]], Eldora is a half-mile dirt track known to many as \"Auto Racing's Showcase Since 1954.\" Stewart began racing there in 1991 and continues racing in special events alongside other Sprint Cup drivers and dirt track legends.\n\n=====2005 season: 2nd Cup Championship=====\n[[File:Tony Stewart 2005 at Infineon photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|Stewart on two wheels before going on to win the 2005 Dodge/Save Mart 350, at [[Infineon Raceway]]]]\n2005 was one of Stewart's most successful years in the Nextel Cup Series as he won his second Cup title. He won five races at Infineon, Daytona, New Hampshire, Watkins Glen (which gave him a sweep of the road course races for the year and a record 3 straight road course wins) and Indianapolis, his hometown track (in a race that Stewart said he would give up his championship to win, and took with it the No. 1 seed heading into NASCAR's Chase for the Nextel Cup 10-race playoff).\n\n[[File:Tony Stewart's 2005 Brickyard.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart's 2005 [[Allstate 400 at the Brickyard]] winning car on display at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] museum.]]\nFollowing his win in the Pepsi 400, Stewart began climbing the fence separating the fans from the race track after each victory, borrowing [[IndyCar Series]] driver [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]]' trademark move.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/indycar/news/story?id=3474464 |title=ESPN&nbsp;\u2013 Castroneves, Penske verbally agree on long-term deal&nbsp;\u2013 Racing |publisher=ESPN |date=July 5, 2008 |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref> After winning the 2009 All-Star race, Stewart was quoted as saying \"I'm too damn fat to be climbing fences,\" and recently purchased $17,000 worth of [[exercise equipment]] to remedy the problem. It also led to sponsor [[The Home Depot]] cashing in on Stewart's success with some promotions reminiscent of Stewart's Eldora Speedway drivers. After his second full climb of the fence in Loudon, N.H., they ran a discount on ladders and fencing at the stores with a campaign named, \"Hey Tony, we've got ladders\", where anyone who presented the advertisement in national newspapers in their stores earned the discount. After his victory in Indianapolis, The Home Depot presented fans who presented the advertisement of his Allstate 400 win with a discount on purchasing bricks. He mentioned in a press release from his sponsor, \"I plan to keep winning races and helping to drive down the cost of home improvement for The Home Depot customers.\"\n\nOn November 20, 2005, Stewart won his second Cup Championship, joining [[Jeff Gordon]] as the only active, full-time drivers at the time to have won multiple championships. [[Jimmie Johnson]] afterward did so from 2006 to 2010. In victory circle, Stewart had said that he loved winning his 2005 championship better than his 2002 one because his 2005 season was more well-behaved than 2002. At an age of 34, this made Stewart one of the youngest drivers to win multiple championships (with Johnson joining this category as he won his five straight titles while in his early 30s) and to date, he is still the only driver to have won championships under both the Chase and non-Chase formats. During the 2005 season, Stewart won a total of $13,578,168, including $6,173,633 for winning the championship, the largest season total in NASCAR history.\n\n===== 2006 season: Championship Hangover =====\nStewart's 2006 season had up and down notes. He had competitive cars and scored early wins at Daytona and [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]]. However, he also had strings of bad luck. He also suffered a shoulder injury due to two heavy crashes in both the Busch and Cup races at Charlotte during the Memorial Day Weekend races (Stewart's Busch car hit the Turn 4 wall so hard it even knocked the rear end off the car). During the Dover race, he was substituted by [[Ricky Rudd]] and, in later weeks, had to drive in pain.\n\nAdditionally, he has once again been involved in several on-track controversies.\n\nFollowing a rough Bud Shootout on February 12, 2006, Stewart expressed concern to the media about the possibility of aggressive driving resulting in the serious injury or death of a driver. It came during a week in which the racing world remembered the fifth anniversary of Dale Earnhardt's death. Just a few days later, during the [[2006 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], Stewart was involved in several incidents with [[Jeff Gordon]], [[Kyle Busch]], and [[Matt Kenseth]], whom he chased halfway across the track to run into the grass. \"He has no room to complain,\" Stewart said of his brush with Kenseth. \"He started it, and I finished it\".\n\nOn May 20, 2006, during NASCAR's All Star Race, Stewart and Kenseth wrecked again. Each driver claimed it was the other one's fault with Stewart saying, \"if (Kenseth) thinks it's my fault and I (caused the wreck) he's screwed up in his head.\" Following the wreck, several media outlets proclaimed the new Stewart-Kenseth rivalry as must-see TV.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ron Lemasters Jr., Special to NASCAR.COM |url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/05/21/tstewart.mkenseth.crash/ |title=Stewart-Kenseth crash leads to verbal sparring |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=May 21, 2006 |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref> The so-called rivalry was short-lived as Kenseth and Stewart participated as friends in a joint promotional tour for DeWalt and The Home Depot;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dewalt.com/us/members/register/winnerscircle/ |title=High Performance Industrial Tools and Accessories |publisher=DEWALT |date=March 25, 2009 |access-date=October 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107024229/http://www.dewalt.com/us/members/register/winnerscircle/ |archive-date=January 7, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Kenseth also appeared in September at Stewart's [[Eldora Speedway]] in the NEXTEL PRELUDE with NASCAR drivers, as well as the ARCA Truck Series event there.\n\nOn July 1, 2006, Stewart dominated the Pepsi 400 but after a pit stop seemed like an unlikely contender for the win. However, Stewart amazed the audience when in the final 10 laps he drove from 14th up to second place, and passed [[Boris Said]] to take the lead and win. After the race, Stewart said he no longer wanted to climb the catch-fencing at Daytona because of the fans crowding him but he later changed his mind on that thought.\n\nOn July 23, 2006, Stewart once again was at the center of a media storm. On lap 31 of the [[Pennsylvania 500]], Stewart was accidentally squeezed against the wall by [[Clint Bowyer]]. Stewart responded by waving his hand in anger, then purposely hitting Bowyer's car. This contact sent Bowyer spinning down the front stretch where he collided with [[Carl Edwards]]. Stewart was promptly held one lap by [[NASCAR]] for rough driving. He did however pass leader [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] to get back on the lead lap and eventually rallied to finish 7th and get back in the top 10 in the point standings. After initially refusing to take responsibility for the incident he apologized the next day.<ref>{{cite web |author=Team Release |url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/07/24/tstewart.pocono.blame/index.html |title=Stewart takes blame for incident at Pocono |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=July 24, 2006 |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nStewart missed the cut to qualify for the 2006 Chase for the Nextel Cup by 16 points,<ref>{{cite web |author=Ron Lemasters Jr., Special to NASCAR.COM |url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/headlines/cup/09/10/tstewart.richmond/index.html |title=Stewart left chasing 11th instead of defending title |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=September 10, 2006 |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref> becoming the first defending champion to miss the Chase the following year.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/racing/news/20130701/nascar-brad-keselowski-chase-chances.ap/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704190648/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/racing/news/20130701/nascar-brad-keselowski-chase-chances.ap/|date=July 4, 2013}}</ref> He finished poorly at [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]] after wrecking his primary car in practice, and was displaced in the top ten by [[Kasey Kahne]]. As a result, he finished the 2006 season 11th in points, his worst thus far in his career, as he had completed each of his seven previous seasons in the top ten in points. Commenting on not being in the 2006 Chase, he says: \"It lets us have the ability to take chances and try things ... that we've been wanting to try but just haven't had the luxury to do it. If we were in the Chase we wouldn't have that ability\".<ref>{{cite web |author=David Newton, NASCAR.COM |url=http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/opinion/11/06/tstewart_dnewton/index.html |title=Chasers lucky Stewart didn't get fit sooner |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=November 6, 2006 |access-date=October 8, 2009 |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604033550/http://www.nascar.com/2006/news/opinion/11/06/tstewart_dnewton/index.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Stewart won three races in the 2006 Chase ([[Kansas Speedway|Kansas]], [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]], and [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]]).\n\nThe season was not unkind to Stewart, however. He was a participant in the 30th season of [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] and won 2 of the 4 races (Texas, and the Daytona road course) on his way to capturing the series championship. He won a million dollars for the effort but made an offer to return his prize money if IROC would hold one of its events at his Eldora Speedway. This offer was not entertained as IROC folded in 2007. In addition, Stewart's three wins in the Chase races gave him five total for the season, tying him with Jimmie Johnson and Kevin Harvick for second-most in Nextel Cup behind Kasey Kahne's six.\n\n=====2007 season=====\n[[File:TonyStewartTexas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stewart races by at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in 2007.]]\nStewart started the 2007 season by winning his second [[Chili Bowl Nationals]] midget car feature. Stewart started off the Daytona Speedweeks with a win in the 2007 [[Budweiser Shootout]]. It was his third win in the race.<ref>[http://www.hawkeyeracingnews.com/action.html \"Tony Stewart Snares 21st Annual Chili Bowl Nationals Finale\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217180912/http://hawkeyeracingnews.com/action.html |date=December 17, 2006 }}, January 13, 2007, Hawkeye Racing News. Retrieved January 25, 2007.</ref> He also won his qualifying race for the Daytona 500.\n\nOn lap 152 of the Daytona 500, the rear of Stewart's car slid up the track and, when he tried to cut down the track, he smacked the front of [[Kurt Busch]]'s car knocking both of them out of the race. Stewart and the Busch brothers ([[Kurt Busch|Kurt]] and [[Kyle Busch|Kyle]]) were the three leaders for the majority of the race.\n\nOn March 22, 2007, it was announced that Stewart would be on the cover of the official NASCAR video game ''[[NASCAR 08]]'', published by [[Electronic Arts]]. This would be the third time this honor was given to Stewart ([[NASCAR 2001|2001]] & [[NASCAR Thunder 2004|2003]]).\n\nIn his first [[Car of Tomorrow]] race with the [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala SS]], Stewart was dominant at [[Bristol Motor Speedway|Bristol]], leading 257 of 504 laps ([[green-white-checker finish]]), before he experienced a fuel pump problem. In his third [[Car of Tomorrow]] race at [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], Stewart lead a race high 132 laps, but a late race caution moved Stewart to 2nd, where he finished behind [[Jeff Gordon]]. In the following week, Stewart implied the cautions were \"bogus\" and that NASCAR is \"rigged like [[professional wrestling]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18312037/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427002233/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18312037/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 27, 2007 |title=Stewart says NASCAR rigged like wrestling |publisher=MSNBC |date=April 25, 2007 |access-date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn June 4, 2007, Stewart and Kurt Busch had another altercation on pit road in the [[Autism Speaks 400]] at [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]]. Kurt Busch passed Stewart on the inside and then slid up, which caused contact, sending him into the wall, knocking out  Busch, but with Stewart staying in the race. Initially, it was thought that Stewart intentionally crashed Busch due to hard feelings over their accident at Daytona that year. Under the caution, Stewart was on pit road and his crew was surveying the massive damage he received from the crash; when an enraged Busch pulled alongside and gave Stewart a profane gesture to express his feelings over the incident. One of Stewart's pit-crew members jumped out of the way of Busch's car to avoid being hit, while Busch was parked for the contact made on pit road. Busch would later be fined $100k for his actions by NASCAR, while Stewart got off with a pre-race warning from NASCAR before the following race at Pocono.\n\nAt the All-Star Race at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], he finished 5th behind Kevin Harvick, Jimmie Johnson, Mark Martin, and Jeff Burton. At the Coca-Cola 600, Stewart finished sixth, after having to come into the pit for fuel. On July 15, 2007, Stewart led a race-high 108 laps and recorded his 30th career NEXTEL Cup win at the [[USG Sheetrock 400]] at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Joliet]].\n\nOn July 29, 2007, after leading a race-high 65 of 160 laps, Stewart won the Brickyard 400 again, just 45 minutes from where he grew up. This was his second win in the race at his favorite track. It was not without controversy though; Stewart made the winning pass by accidentally bending the rear of [[Kevin Harvick]]'s car, causing Harvick to fall back quickly to seventh place by the time the checkers waved. Stewart apologized for the contact in victory lane and during the victory lane interview, Stewart was penalized 25 points and fined $25,000 for violating NASCAR's policy on the use of obscene language during interviews during the race. This was similar to 2004 when [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] used an obscenity in a post-race interview at Talladega and was knocked out of the points lead as a result of the penalty.\n\nOn August 12, 2007, he won the [[Centurion Boats at the Glen]] at [[Watkins Glen International|Watkins Glen]] after Jeff Gordon spun his car around after wheel hopping in turn 1 with two laps to go. Carl Edwards briefly challenged Stewart on the final lap, but spun out into a pullover site sealing Stewart's win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/watkins-glen-tony-stewart-race-report-2007-08-15/2216961/|title=Watkins Glen: Tony Stewart race report|work=[[Motorsport.com]]|date=August 12, 2007|access-date=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====2008 season: Final Season At JGR=====\n[[File:Tony Stewart 2008 Home Depot Toyota Camry.jpg|260px|thumbnail|Stewart's Toyota Camry.]]\nStewart began the 2008 season with a 6th-place start in the [[Daytona 500]]. During this race, he was only able to come up with a 3rd-place finish after being passed by [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] and [[Kurt Busch]] on the last lap. The finish of this race was somewhat like a repeat of the [[2007 Daytona 500|previous year's Daytona 500]], in which Stewart's close friend [[Kevin Harvick]] passed [[Mark Martin]] to win it.\n\nOn lap 109 of the [[UAW-Dodge 400]], Stewart's car cut a tire and slammed hard into the turn 3 retaining wall. Although he climbed out under his own power, Stewart was transported by ambulance to the infield care center. Stewart had complained about a sore foot from a wreck that occurred the day before the [[NASCAR Nationwide Series|Nationwide Series]] race at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]]. Stewart was later announced that he was okay and ripped on [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] for not bringing any quality tires.\n\nWith 3 laps to go in the 2008 Coca-Cola 600, Stewart cut a tire and saved it from contact with the wall. However, Stewart had to give up the lead to future race winner [[Kasey Kahne]] to make pit stops.\n\nIn the [[Best Buy 400]], Stewart was involved in another crash with [[Elliott Sadler]], in which Sadler got turned by [[David Gilliland]] and car collected Stewart and 11 other cars; those included [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] and [[Denny Hamlin]]. Stewart, who was frustrated over his misfortune, sarcastically said, \"I take 100 percent responsibility&nbsp;\u2013 it's my fault for being anywhere close to Elliott. If I'm within half a lap of him, I expect that to happen. It's my fault&nbsp;\u2013 I'm the one that hit him. When I hit him, it caused all the guys behind us to wreck, so it's my fault.\"\n\nIn July 2008, Stewart made a deal with car owner Gene Haas into a co-owning partnership in a racing organization called Stewart-Haas Racing for 2009 when he left Joe Gibbs Racing. Ryan Newman came to the meeting to make his deal with SHR officially signed earlier in the year.\n\nOn July 5, 2008, during the [[Coke Zero 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]], Stewart started feeling ill and turned his car over to former [[Joe Gibbs Racing]] teammate [[J. J.

Stewart finished 24th and waved to Bowyer to congratulate him as he slowly crossed the line to finish.

Stewart made it two for two in the Chase after [[Clint Bowyer]] ran out of fuel in the closing laps of the [[Sylvania 300]] at the [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]]. Stewart took the win and the points lead after New Hampshire. At Talladega, Stewart struggled to lead a lap, and eventually did so; with assistance from [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]], [[Paul Menard]], and [[Joey Logano]], he led an additional 29 laps and captured the two-point bonus for leading the most laps. On October 30, 2011, at Martinsville Speedway, Stewart won the [[Tums Fast Relief 500]], leading three times for 14 laps and moving into championship contention in second place in the points standings.\n\nThe next week, Stewart led 173 laps en route to winning the AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, bringing him to within three points of championship points leader Carl Edwards with two races to go in the 2011 season.

Stewart won the 1st duel of the [[Gatorade Duels]] at Daytona when his new driver [[Danica Patrick]] hit the wall hard on the backstretch on the final lap, which brought out the caution. Stewart started 3rd in the [[Daytona 500]] and ran well throughout the race, but was caught up in a late-race crash on lap 196 after getting turned by [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]] On March 11, Stewart won the [[Kobalt Tools 400]] at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]] beating Jimmie Johnson. It was his 45th career win and brought his streak of consecutive Cup seasons with a win to 14.\n\nOn March 25, 2012, Stewart won the rain-shortened [[Auto Club 400]] at [[Auto Club Speedway]]. On June 3, 2012, Stewart was caught in a 13 car crash on the back leg at Dover and finished the race in 25th place.\n\nTony Stewart led 18 laps at the 2012 Quicken Loans 400 and finished second behind [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] Stewart however caused controversy and got ripped by the fans and media for saying in a media conference that Earnhardt winning \"Is not a national holiday.\" and taunting the Earnhardt nation for celebrating the 4th anniversary of Earnhardt's last win in 2008.\n\nAt Sonoma, Stewart moved quickly from the top 20 to third in the final laps of the [[Toyota Save Mart 350]] and ended up second to [[Clint Bowyer]] by passing [[Kurt Busch]] on the final turn on the final lap. On July 7, Stewart was able to hold off [[Matt Kenseth]] to win his fourth [[2012 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400]] as a wreck ensued behind him. The win was a surprise one, as Stewart had been forced to start 42nd due to his car failing pre-qualifying inspection.\n\nIn August at Bristol in the [[2012 Irwin Tools Night Race]], when battling for the lead on lap 333, Stewart and [[Matt Kenseth]] tangled and brought out a caution. This was soon after [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] was wrecked by [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] in an accident which collected [[Jeff Burton]]. A furious Stewart climbed out of his wrecked car and angrily tossed his helmet at Kenseth's car, who exit out of the pit road, and then gestured applause at the fans.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Langford|first=Richard|date=August 26, 2012|title=Tony Stewart: Heated Driver Throws Helmet at Matt Kenseth After Wreck at Bristol|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1311445-tony-stewart-heated-driver-throws-helmet-at-matt-kenseth-after-wreck-at-bristol|work=[[Bleacher Report]]|access-date=June 16, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106115406/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1311445-tony-stewart-heated-driver-throws-helmet-at-matt-kenseth-after-wreck-at-bristol|archive-date=November 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> This was followed shortly thereafter by his student driver [[Danica Patrick]] wagging a finger at [[Regan Smith (racing driver)|Regan Smith]] after he turned her into the inside wall many laps later.\n\nIn September at Atlanta, team spokesman Mike Arning announced that Office Depot will not be Stewart's sponsor in 2013.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/news/stewart-loses-co-primary-sponsor-001548626--nascar.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906044723/https://sports.yahoo.com/news/stewart-loses-co-primary-sponsor-001548626--nascar.html|date=September 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn October 2, 2012, [[Bass Pro Shops]] announced they would be a co-primary sponsor for Stewart in a selected number of races for the 2013 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/10/05/tony-stewart-bass-pro-shops-nascar-sprint-cup/1615381/|title=Tony Stewart lands Bass Pro Shops sponsorship|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=October 5, 2012|first1=Nate|last1=Ryan|date=October 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2012 Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500|Talladega]] race in the fall, Stewart was leading on the final lap but underestimated the speed of a closing [[Michael Waltrip]]. On turn 4, Waltrip got a run, and tapped Stewart from behind, causing Stewart to spin and Waltrip to spin into the pack, causing a Big One that involved 23 cars, the largest crash of the season to date. Stewart flipped over, hitting the roofs of several other cars, including [[Kasey Kahne]], [[Paul Menard]], and [[Clint Bowyer]], before landing upright. On November 9, it was announced that [[Kevin Harvick]] would be joining Stewart's team starting in 2014.\n\nStewart would finish ninth in points, with two top-fives and four top tens in the Chase, for a final season total of three wins, 12 top-five, and 16 top-ten finishes overall.\n\n=====2013 season=====\n[[File:Tony Stewart Daytona July 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart during the [[2013 Coke Zero 400]]]]\nIn early 2013, reports said that Stewart was offered a chance by [[Roger Penske]] to race in the [[2013 Indianapolis 500]] in a Penske car.

He rebounded slightly with an 8th-place finish at Phoenix and an 11th-place finish in Las Vegas. At Bristol, Stewart blew his tire on lap 3 and cut a brake line; he came back out over 20 laps down, unable to contend for the victory.\n\nAt Fontana, Stewart ran well for most of the day, leading laps and running on an alternate pit cycle, and nearly contended for the win. However, due to a late-race incident when [[Joey Logano]] blocked him on the last restart, Stewart ended up in 22nd place at the bottom of the lead lap. After the race, Stewart, angered, confronted Logano, who had just wrecked his car after battling with [[Denny Hamlin]] hard into the last turn, on pit road in a scuffle involving both teams' crews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2013-03-25/california-2013-results-roger-penske-backs-joey-logano-tony-stewart-blocking|title=Roger Penske backs Joey Logano, says Tony Stewart blocks too|date=March 25, 2013|work=[[Sporting News]]|access-date=2013-03-25}}</ref>\n\nAt Richmond, Stewart looked to be in contention for the win as he was 5th on a green-white-checkered finish, but in a fashion similar to his confrontation with Logano at Fontana; after a poor restart he lost a few positions. On the last lap, [[Kurt Busch]] tapped his bumper, moving Stewart out of the 2nd groove up to the top of the race track subsequently losing about 5 positions coming home 18th while Busch took a 9th-place finish. Stewart showed his displeasure with Busch after the race had finished, rubbing with him on the race track leading to a shoving match between the two when slowing down after the race ended. Down near the haulers, the two turned the attention given to race winner Harvick; to them when they had a verbal confrontation, again Stewart showing Busch his displeasure with his aggressive move. It was the first time since 2008 that the two got together in a feud.\n\nAt Talladega, Stewart was caught up in a 15 car wreck on lap 43 and ended up finishing 27th, 5 laps down. His teammates [[Danica Patrick]] and [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] were caught up in a later wreck on lap 182, in which Newman's car got crushed when [[Kurt Busch]] flipped over and landed on top of it.\n[[File:Team Dover participates in Race Weekend 130602-F-FC116-003.jpg|thumb|left|Stewart after winning the [[2013 FedEx 400]]]]\nStewart's 2013 season start was considered his worst start to a Sprint Cup season yet. As of Richmond, he had only one Top 10 finish, which was at Phoenix. The rest of his finishing positions had been in the upper 10's or lower 20's. After Richmond, Stewart was 22nd in the points standings with 207 points, 136 behind [[Jimmie Johnson]]. However, he showed signs of a rebound in the following weeks, scoring a solid 7th-place finish at the Coca-Cola 600 while avoiding several wrecks.\n\nThe following week at Dover, Stewart went a lap down early but got back on the lead lap with a beneficiary. In the last 20 laps, after Johnson was penalized for jumping the last restart, Stewart overtook [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] and held him off over the last three laps to score his sole Sprint Cup win of 2013. The win propelled him up 4 positions to 16th, into a Wildcard spot. This also gave Stewart a streak of 15 straight seasons with at least one race win. He followed this up with a fourth-place finish at Pocono and a fifth place at Michigan. His momentum was killed briefly by a 28th-place run at Sonoma and a 20th-place finish at Kentucky, but Stewart then rebounded to a second-place finish at the Coke Zero 400.\n\nAt New Hampshire, Stewart led 84 laps and was overtaken by [[Brian Vickers]] with 14 laps to go. A caution that led to a green-white-checkered finish ultimately ruined Stewart's chances of winning, as he ran out of fuel after the restart while Vickers took the win. Stewart then rebounded with a 4th-place run at Indianapolis and a 9th-place run at Pocono.\n\n======Leg injury======\nThe day after the Pocono race, on August 5, 2013, while leading a [[sprint car racing|sprint car race]] at Southern Iowa Speedway in [[Oskaloosa, Iowa]], Stewart was involved in a multi-car crash when a lapped car spun in front of him and Stewart drove straight into him while it was sideways causing him to flip multiple times.

Stewart entered the Daytona 500 in his backup car, starting from the rear of the field. After the 6 hour and 22-minute rain delay, the race resumed, but just shy of halfway, Stewart's fuel pickup began to fail. His crew repaired the problem in the garage and allowed Stewart to return to the track, finishing the race 27 laps down.\n\nThe next week at Phoenix, Stewart ran in the top ten most of the day. A late string of cautions set up multiple restarts and Stewart opted to come down to pit road to be serviced each time the caution was thrown, subsequently losing track position. On the last and final restart, Stewart had 4 fresh tires and was starting 19th. He gained 3 positions, from 19th to 16th, where he finished. Stewart gained 12 spots in the standings, from 32nd to 20th.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hembree|first=Mike|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/02/15/denny-hamlin-wins-sprint-unlimited-daytona-shootout/5523671/|title=Denny Hamlin wins Sprint Unlimited on wild night|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=February 15, 2014|access-date=February 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt Las Vegas, Stewart struggled with the handling of his car and finished 33rd, four laps down.\n\nAt Bristol, Stewart missed the second round of knockout qualifying and started 37th. However, with a fast racecar, he was able to make his way up the field and finish fourth, his first top-five finish since the [[2013 Brickyard 400|previous year's Brickyard 400]]. Stewart was the highest finishing Chevrolet in the race.\n\nStewart qualified 10th at Auto Club. After a spin early in the race, Stewart was running 12th at the last caution, coming off of pit road 2nd and lining up 4th for the green-white-checkered finish behind Paul Menard, his driver Kurt Busch, and Landon Cassill. On the final restart, Stewart and Busch battled for the win, only to be passed up by Kyle Busch and [[Kyle Larson]]. Stewart finished third not being passed by Matt Kenseth, his fifth top 5 in a row.\n\nStewart had a strong run at Pocono. He qualified in the top five and ran in there nearly the whole race, before a speeding penalty on pit road left him with a 13th-place finish. When Stewart was asked about what happened he said \"It was a 100% driver error. Last week I cried over a 6th place finish and I just threw this one away. 100% driver error. My fault.\"\n\nAt Michigan, Stewart ran in the top-five. Late in the race, Stewart tangled with rookie Kyle Larson when Larson threw a block, leaving Stewart with an 11th-place finish. Stewart replied by bumping Larson under yellow and side-swiping him. The next week Stewart said \"He'll learn not to block me. One way or another he'll learn like I did at his age.\"\n\nAfter the Kevin Ward Jr. tragedy in mid-August, Stewart skipped Watkins Glen, Michigan, and Bristol. He was subbed by [[Regan Smith (racing driver)|Regan Smith]] and [[Jeff Burton]] for those races. Despite having missed three races and thus losing too many points to recover lost points in the final 2 races, NASCAR granted him a waiver allowing him to still be eligible for the Chase if he won in the final two 'regular season' events, which he failed to do, causing him to miss the Chase for the third time in his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-08-29/tony-stewart-return-nascar-approval-chase-waiver-mental-health-emotional-state|title=NASCAR clears Tony Stewart to race, grants waiver for Chase|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|date=August 29, 2014|work=[[Sporting News]]|access-date=2014-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019024801/http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2014-08-29/tony-stewart-return-nascar-approval-chase-waiver-mental-health-emotional-state|archive-date=October 19, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the October Charlotte race, Stewart was hit on pit road by [[Brad Keselowski]], who was trying to run into [[Matt Kenseth]], but missed.

On the final restart, he pulled out in front of [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] but having older tires, got over-taken by Earnhardt with four laps to go. Stewart finished 4th but stated that after what he went through from August to then, finishing 4th felt like a win to him.\n\nStewart finished the year with a last-place finish at Homestead-Miami, ending his 15-year winning streak. As a driver, 2014 was Stewart's worst year statistically. The season ended on a positive note for Stewart, as he won the Owner's Championship with [[Kevin Harvick]]. In an interview the day before the race, Stewart blamed his subpar year on the new rules package, saying it did not complement his driving style. He also dismissed countless claims that his poor showing had anything to do with his 2013 leg injury.\n\n======Return to sprint cars======\nOn February 15, 2014, Stewart returned to sprint car racing in his No. 14 sprint car, the very car that broke his leg in 2013. When asked why he returned, Stewart said he loved racing sprint cars too much to leave. Stewart silenced his critics by dominating and winning a sprint car race at Tri-City Motor Speedway in a huge comeback story. After the race Stewart said:\n{{blockquote|It was a confidence boost for me. When you haven't won and haven't been necessarily a contender, you start questioning what is it in the equation that you're missing. Is it something that you're doing or not doing as a driver?

Before the Richmond race, NASCAR granted Stewart a waiver from the rule saying that a driver must attempt every race to be eligible for the Chase. If Stewart won a race and finished in the top 30 in the standings by the autumn Richmond race, he would qualify for the 2016 Chase for the Sprint Cup.\n\nFor the running of the [[GEICO 500]] at Talladega, Stewart would struggle at the beginning of the race but he would switch with Ty Dillon after the first caution and Dillon would drive the rest of the race; the doctor advised Stewart not to drive the whole race to avoid further injury. The No. 14 car would get the free pass after the first caution. Dillon would finish 6th, but Stewart would get the credit since he started the race and would get his first top 10 of the year. He finished 12th at Kansas the following week. At Michigan for the running of the FireKeepers Casino 400, Stewart would have his best race of the year so far, he would qualify a strong 3rd and run great all race long and would finish 7th.\n\n[[File:Tony Stewart Final NASCAR Win.jpg|thumb|right|Stewart after winning the [[2016 Toyota/Save Mart 350]]]]\nThe very next week at Sonoma, Stewart took advantage of a late caution and was able to lead the last 20 laps, winning for the first time in three years after making a last-lap pass on [[Denny Hamlin]], who wheel-hopped in the final turn and hit the wall after Stewart slipped into the inside. The win was very popular amongst the garages and the win vaulted Stewart from 34th to 31st in the standings, just 9 points out of the top 30. Then the next race at Daytona, Stewart finished 26th due to a late wreck, but moved up to 30th in the points and currently became part of the Chase for the first time since 2012. He did much better at Kentucky, finishing a solid 5th and further propelling him to 20th in owner's points. The next week at New Hampshire he would continue his streak of strong races and get a 2nd-place finish, followed by two 5th-place finishes at Pocono and Watkins Glen.\n\nAt Richmond, Stewart was involved in a controversy with 28 laps to go in the race. Stewart, while racing former teammate [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] for 10th place, wrecked Newman in turn 3, causing a five-car pileup and ending Newman's chase chances. In an interview minutes after the crash, Newman was outspoken about his displeasure against Stewart and said \"I guess he thought he was in a sprint car again and didn't know how to control his anger. It's disappointing that you have somebody who should be retired the way he drives. It's just ridiculous.\" Stewart's bid for a fourth title ended after poor finishes caused him to be eliminated from the first round of the Chase. After having his final top-ten at the [[2016 Bank of America 500]], Tony Stewart wrapped up his 18-year career in Cup competition with a 22nd-place finish at the [[2016 Ford EcoBoost 400]] where he was 2 laps down.\n\nBefore the [[2016 Brickyard 400|23rd running]] of the [[Brickyard 400]], Stewart was inducted into the USAC Hall of Fame in recognition of his sterling United States Auto Club (USAC) career.
