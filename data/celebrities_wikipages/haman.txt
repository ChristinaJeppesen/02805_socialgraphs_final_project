After Haman was appointed the principal minister of the king [[Ahasuerus]], all of the king's servants were required to [[Proskynesis|bow down]] to Haman, but [[Mordechai]] refused to. Angered by this, and knowing of Mordechai's Jewish nationality, Haman convinced Ahasuerus to allow him to have all of the [[Persian Jews|Jews in the Persian empire]] killed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3|title=Esther 3|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref>\n\nThe plot was foiled by Queen [[Esther]], the king's recent wife, who was herself a Jew. Esther invited Haman and the king to two banquets. In the second banquet, she informed the king that Haman was plotting to kill her (and the other Jews). This enraged the king, who was further angered when (after leaving the room briefly and returning) he discovered Haman had fallen on Esther's couch, intending to beg mercy from Esther, but which the king interpreted as a sexual advance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.7.2|title=Esther 7:2|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref>\n\nOn the king's orders, Haman was hanged from the 50-cubit-high [[gallows]] that had originally been built by Haman himself, on the advice of his wife [[Zeresh]], in order to hang Mordecai.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.7.9|title=Esther 7:9|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref> The bodies of Haman's ten sons were also hanged, after they died in battle against the Jews.<ref name=\"Esther 9:6-14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.9.6|title=Esther 9:6|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref> The Jews also killed about 75,000 of their enemies in self-defense.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sefaria.org.il/Esther.9.16?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he|title=Esther 9:16|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref>\n\nThe apparent purpose of this unusually high gallows can be understood from the geography of [[Susa|Shushan]]: Haman's house (where the pole was located) was likely in the city of Susa (a flat area), while the royal citadel and palace were located on a mound about 15 meters higher than the city. Such a tall pole would have allowed Haman to observe Mordecai's corpse while dining in the royal palace, had his plans worked as intended.<ref>Yehuda Landy, ''Purim and the Persian Empire'', p. 83</ref>\n\n== Haman in other sources ==\n=== Midrash ===\n{{main|Haman in rabbinic literature}}\nAccording to [[Hanan bar Rava|\u1e24anan b.

Having attempted to exterminate the Jews of Persia, and rendering himself thereby their worst enemy, Haman naturally became the center of many Talmudic legends. Being at one time extremely poor, he sold himself as a slave to Mordecai.<ref>Megillah 15a</ref> He was a barber at Kefar Karzum for the space of twenty-two years.<ref>Megillah 16a</ref> Haman had an idolatrous image embroidered on his garments, so that those who bowed to him at command of the king bowed also to the image.<ref>[[Esther Rabbah]] 7</ref>\n\nHaman was also an [[astrologer]], and when he was about to fix the time for the genocide of the Jews he first [[Cleromancy|cast lots]] to ascertain which was the most auspicious day of the week for that purpose.<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\"/> Each day, however, proved to be under some influence favorable to the Jews.<ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /> He then sought to fix the month, but found that the same was true of each month; thus, [[Nisan]] was favorable to the Jews because of the [[Passover]] sacrifice; [[Iyyar]], because of the small Passover.<ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /> But when he arrived at [[Adar]] he found that its zodiacal sign was [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]], and he said, \"Now I shall be able to swallow them as fish which swallow one another\" (Esther Rabbah 7; [[Targum Sheni]] 3).<ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com />\n\nHaman had 365 counselors, but the advice of none was so good as that of his wife, Zeresh.<ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /> She induced Haman to build a gallows for Mordechai, assuring him that this was the only way in which he would be able to prevail over his enemy, for hitherto the just had always been rescued from every other kind of death.<ref name=jewishencyclopedia.com /> As God foresaw that Haman himself would be hanged on the gallows, he asked which tree would volunteer to serve as the instrument of death. Each tree, declaring that it was used for some holy purpose, objected to being soiled by the unclean body of Haman. Only the thorn-tree could find no excuse, and therefore offered itself for a gallows (Esther Rabbah 9; Midrash Abba Gorion 7 (ed. Buber, Wilna, 1886); in Targum Sheni this is narrated somewhat differently).\n\nAccording to the [[Targum Sheni]], he killed the prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], who managed to live to [[Ahasuerus]]'s reign (Targum Sheini on Esther, 4, 11).\n\n=== Quran ===\n{{Main|Haman (Islam)}}\n\nIn the [[Qur'an]] ([[Islam]]'s primary scripture), '''Haman''' ({{lang-ar|\u0647\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646|H\u0101m\u0101n}}) is not a proper name, but a title of the court official and [[high priest]] of the [[pharaoh]], and is associated with him in his court at the time of prophet, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]].

Josephus's account of the story draws from the [[Septuagint]] translation of the Book of Esther and from other Greek and Jewish sources, some no longer extant.\n\n===Septuagint===\nThe [[LXX]] calls Haman a \"[[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]\" by [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] (see Esther 16:10). Scholars have had two different explanations for this naming:\n\n# Macedonian was used to replace the word \"Mede\", and emphasises this when he also says that no Persian blood existed in him. (In practice the Persians and the [[Medes]] co-ruled an empire, but great friction existed between them.)\n# Another opinion is that Xerxes called him a Macedonian Spy, due to his insistence on causing civil war within [[Persia]] between the [[Jews]] and the [[Persian people|Persians]].\n\nThe Septuagint translates the \"hang\" ({{lang-he|\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05dc\u05d5|lit='hang', 'hang up'}}) of [[Esther 7]]:9\u201310 as \"crucify\" or \"impale\" ({{lang-grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03b8\u03ae\u03c4\u03c9|staur\u014dth\u0113t\u014d|impale}}), using the same verb later used in the [[New Testament|New Testament's]] ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]''. The fifty-cubit apparatus used in the execution is described ambiguously using a word ({{lang-grc|\u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd|xulon|wood}}) which could mean a tree, a club, a stave, a gibbet, a gallows, the vertical component of a cross for crucifixion, or anything made of wood, an ambiguity already present in the original ({{lang-he|\u05d4\u05e2\u05e5|lit='tree', 'wood'}}).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://studybible.info/compare/Esther%207:9-10|title=Esther 7:9\u201310, Apostolic Polyglot Bible English|website=Study Bible|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biblehub.com/str/greek/3586.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 3586. \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (xulon) \u2013 wood|website=biblehub.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Vulgate ===\n[[File:The Punishment of Haman.png|thumb|''Crucifixion of Haman'' by Michelangelo, Sistine Chapel]]\nAs in the Septuagint, Haman's execution is ambiguous, suggestive of both [[hanging]] and [[crucifixion]]. The fifty-cubit object, described as ''xylon'' in the Septuagint ({{lang-grc|\u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd|xulon|wood}}), is similarly ambiguously referred to as \"wood\" ({{Lang-la|lignum}}). The Vulgate translation of Esther 7:10 furthermore refers to a {{Lang|la|patibulum}}, used elsewhere to describe the cross-piece in crucifixion, when describing the fate of Haman: {{Lang-la|suspensus est itaque Aman in patibulo quod paraverat Mardocheo|lit=therefore was Haman suspended on the ''patibulum'' he prepared for Mordechai|label=none}}.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the corner of the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] is a depiction in [[fresco]] of the execution of Haman by [[Michelangelo]]; Haman is shown crucified in a manner similar to typical [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] depictions of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], though the legs are parted and the apparatus resembles a natural tree shorter than fifty cubits high.\n\n=== Bible in English ===\nTranslations of the ''Book of Esther'''s description of Haman's execution have variously treated the subject. [[Wycliffe's Bible]] referred both to a ''tre'' (tree) and a ''iebat'' (gibbet), while [[Coverdale Bible|Coverdale's]] preferred ''galowe'' (gallows). The [[Geneva Bible]] used ''tree'' but the [[King James Version]] established ''gallows'' and ''hang'' as the most common rendering; the [[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]] later used ''gibbet''.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Young's Literal Translation]] used ''tree'' and ''hang''. The [[New International Version]], [[Common English Bible]], and [[New Living Translation]] all use ''impale'' for {{lang-he|\u05d5\u05d9\u05ea\u05dc\u05d5}} and ''pole'' for {{lang-he|\u05d4\u05e2\u05e5}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblestudytools.com/esther/7-9-compare.html|title=Compare translations Esther 7:9|website=Bible Study Tools|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblestudytools.com/esther/7-10-compare.html|title=Compare translations Esther 7:10|website=Bible Study Tools|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== As a god ===\nJacob Hoschander has argued that the name of Haman and that of his father Hamedatha are mentioned by [[Strabo]] as ''Omanus'' and ''Anadatus,'' worshipped with Anahita in the city of [[Zile|Zela]].

On that day, the Book of Esther is publicly read and much noise and tumult is raised at every mention of Haman's name. Various noisemakers (''[[grager]]s'') are used to express disdain for Haman by \"blotting out\" his name during the recitation of [[Book of Esther|Megillah]]. Pastry known as {{transl|yi|[[hamentashen]]}} (Yiddish for 'Haman's pockets'; known in Hebrew as {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05d6\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05df}}, {{transl|he|ozney Haman}}, 'Haman's ears') are traditionally eaten on this day.\n\n==In literature and popular culture==\n=== Dante's ''Divine Comedy'' ===\nHaman at the moment of his execution appears at the beginning of Canto 17 of ''[[Purgatorio]]'' in Dante's [[Divine Comedy|''Divina Commedia'']]. The image occurs in the form of a spontaneous vision given to the character of Dante-as-pilgrim, the purpose of which is to envision Haman's accusers, Ahaseurus, Esther and Mordecai, as emblems of righteous anger. In this divinely inspired hallucination, the fictional Dante sees Haman as \"''un crucifisso''\", a man who undergoes [[crucifixion]].<ref>Dante Alighieri, ''Divina Commedia'', ''Purgatorio'' XVII, line 26</ref> \n\n=== Novels ===\nMargaret Mitchell's novel, ''[[Gone With the Wind (novel)|Gone With the Wind]]'' (1936) references Haman in the scene in which [[Rhett Butler]], in jail, faces the prospect of hanging.\n\nThe [[Agatha Christie]] novel, ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'' references Haman in a scene where [[Poirot]], investigating a murder, says he will \"hang him as high as Haman\".\n\n=== Visual media ===\nHaman is featured as the primary antagonist in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Jewbilee]]\" (1999) where he is portrayed as attempting to re-enter the mortal world in order to rule once more over the Jews. He is also characterised as evil vizier to a sultan in the \"[[Aladdin|Aliyah-Din]]\" segment of the television animation ''[[Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights]]'' (1994). The character of Haman has also been depicted in the American feature film ''[[One Night with the King]]'' (2006), played by [[James Callis]]. \n\nAmerican children's television animations in which the biblical story of Haman is told include the \"Queen Esther\" episode of the series ''[[The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible]]'' (1985-1992), where he is voiced by [[Werner Klemperer]], and the computer-generated series ''[[VeggieTales]]'' (2000), in which he is portrayed by \"Mr. Lunt\" during the episode \"Esther, the Girl who Became Queen\".  \n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{JewishEncyclopedia|title=HAMAN THE AGAGITE |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7124-haman-the-agagite |first1=Emil  |last1=Hirsch |first2=M. |last2=Seligsohn |first3=Solomon |last3=Schechter |volume=6 |page=189&ndash;190}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commonscatinline}}\n\n{{Purim Footer}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Biblical murderers]]\n[[Category:Book of Esther]]\n[[Category:Esther]]\n[[Category:Hebrew Bible people]]\n[[Category:Amalek]]"}]}}}}
