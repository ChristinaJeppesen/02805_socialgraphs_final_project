He is the primary anchor of the [[CNN]] news broadcast show ''[[Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0]]''. In addition to his duties at CNN, Cooper serves as a correspondent for ''[[60 Minutes]]'' on [[CBS News]]. After graduating from [[Yale University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1989, he began traveling the world, shooting footage of war-torn regions for [[Channel One News]]. Cooper was hired by [[ABC News]] as a correspondent in 1995, but he soon took more jobs throughout the network, working for a short time as a co-anchor, reality game show host, and fill-in morning talk show host.\n\nIn 2001, Cooper joined CNN, where he was given his own show, ''Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0'', in 2003; he has remained the show's host since. He developed a reputation for his on-the-ground reporting of breaking news events, with his coverage of [[Hurricane Katrina]] causing his popularity to sharply increase. For his coverage of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], Cooper received a [[National Order of Honour and Merit]], the highest honor granted by the [[Government of Haiti|Haitian government]]. From September 2011 to May 2013, he also served as the host of his own syndicated daytime talk show, ''[[Anderson Live]]''.\n\nCooper has won 18 [[Emmy Award]]s and two [[Peabody Award]]s, as well as an [[Edward Murrow Award (Overseas Press Club of America)|Edward Murrow Award]] from the [[Overseas Press Club]] in 2011. He came out as gay in 2012, becoming \"the most prominent openly gay journalist on American television\" at the time, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''. In 2016, Cooper became the first openly LGBT person to moderate a [[United States presidential debates|presidential debate]], and he has received several [[GLAAD Media Award|awards from the LGBT rights organization GLAAD]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nCooper was born in [[Manhattan]], New York City, the younger son of writer [[Wyatt Emory Cooper]] and artist [[Gloria Vanderbilt]]. His maternal grandparents were millionaire equestrian [[Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt]] of the [[Vanderbilt family]] and socialite [[Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt]], and Reginald's patrilineal great-grandfather was business magnate [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], who founded the prominent Vanderbilt shipping and railroad fortune.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Whitaker|first=Barbara|date=July 27, 1988|title=Simple Service for Vanderbilt's Son|page=4; Section: News|work=Newsday}}</ref> On his mother's side, he is a great-great-grandson of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Major general|Major General]] [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick]], who was with General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] on his march through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and of the Major General's Chilean wife, Luisa Fernandez de Valdivieso. Through his maternal line, he is a second cousin, once removed, of screenwriter [[James Vanderbilt]].\n\nCooper's media experience began early.

Cooper considers his father's book ''Families'' to be \"sort of a guide on... how he would have wanted me to live my life and the choices he would have wanted me to make. And so I feel very connected to him.\"<ref name=\"Van Meter\" />\n\nWhen Cooper was 21, his older brother, Carter Vanderbilt Cooper, committed [[suicide]] on July 22, 1988, at age 23, by jumping from the 14th-floor terrace of Vanderbilt's New York City penthouse apartment. Gloria Vanderbilt later wrote about her son's death in the book ''A Mother's Story'', in which she expressed her belief that the suicide was caused by a [[psychosis|psychotic episode]] induced by an [[allergy]] to the anti-[[asthma]] [[prescription drug]] [[salbutamol]]. Carter's suicide sparked Anderson's interest in journalism:<ref name=\"Van Meter\" />\n{{Blockquote|text=Loss is a theme that I think a lot about, and it's something in my work that I dwell on. I think when you experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, you have questions about survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can't tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own?}}\n\nCooper attended the [[Dalton School]], a private co-educational day school on the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]]. At age 17, after graduating from Dalton a semester early, Cooper traveled around Africa for several months on a \"survival trip\". He contracted [[malaria]] on the trip and was hospitalized in [[Kenya]].

Persuading Channel One to allow him to bring a [[Hi8]] camera with him, Cooper soon began filming and assembling reports of Vietnamese life and culture that aired on Channel One. In 1992, he returned to filming stories from a variety of war-torn regions around the globe, including [[Somalia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and [[Rwanda]].\n\nAfter having been on such assignments for a couple of years, Cooper realized in 1994 that he had slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the [[Rwandan genocide]] became trivial: \"I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad.\"<ref name=\"Bronson\" /> One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:<ref name=\"Bronson\" />\n{{Blockquote|text=On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days.

Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, \"You need to take a look at what you were doing.\" \"And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective.\"}}\n\n===ABC===\nIn 1995, Cooper became a correspondent for [[ABC News]], eventually rising to the position of co-anchor on its overnight ''[[World News Now]]'' program on September 21, 1999.

In 2001, he joined CNN, commenting, \"Two seasons was enough, and [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] happened, and I thought I needed to be getting back to news.\"<ref name=\"Hirschman\" /> His first position at CNN was to anchor alongside [[Paula Zahn]] on ''[[American Morning]]''. In 2002, he became CNN's weekend prime-time anchor. Since 2002, he has hosted CNN's [[New Year's Eve Live (CNN program)|New Year's Eve special]] from [[Times Square]].\n\n====''Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0''====\nOn September 8, 2003, Cooper became the anchor of ''[[Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0]]'' on CNN. Describing his philosophy as an [[News presenter|anchor]], he has said:<ref name=\"Hirschman\" />\n{{Blockquote|text=I think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it.

I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The [[Kent Brockman|anchorman on ''The Simpsons'']] is a reasonable [[facsimile]] of some anchors who have that problem.}}\n\nIn 2005, Cooper covered a number of important stories, including the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami damage]] in [[Sri Lanka]]; the [[Cedar Revolution]] in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]; the [[death of Pope John Paul II]]; and the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles|royal wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles]].

He was 7.2 lbs at birth, and he is sweet, and soft, and healthy and I am beyond happy. As a gay kid, I never thought it would be possible to have a child, and I'm grateful for all those who have paved the way, and for the doctors and nurses and everyone involved in my son's birth. Most of all, I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt, and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him. It is an extraordinary blessing - what she, and all surrogates give to families who cant have children. My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband, and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives I do wish my mom and dad and my brother, Carter, were alive to meet Wyatt, but I like to believe they can see him.
