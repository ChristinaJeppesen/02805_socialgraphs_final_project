As his grandfather [[Genghis Khan]] advised, Sorghaghtani chose a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Tangut people|Tangut]] woman as her son's nurse, whom Kublai later honored highly. On his way home after the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia]], Genghis Khan performed a ceremony on his grandsons M\u00f6ngke and Kublai after their first hunt in 1224 near the [[Ili River]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Jack |last=Weatherford |title=The Secret History of the Mongol Queens |page=135}}</ref> Kublai was nine years old and with his eldest brother killed a rabbit and an antelope. After his grandfather smeared fat from the killed animals onto Kublai's middle finger in accordance with a Mongol tradition, he said \"The words of this boy [[Kublai]] are full of wisdom, heed them well \u2013 heed them all of you.\" The elderly Genghis Khan would die three years after this event in 1227, when Kublai was 12. Kublai's father Tolui would serve as regent for two years until Genghis' successor, Kublai's third uncle [[Ogedei Khan|Ogedei]], was enthroned as Khagan in 1229.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty]], in 1236, Ogedei gave [[Hebei]] (attached with 80,000 households) to the family of Tolui, who died in 1232. Kublai received an estate of his own, which included 10,000 households. Because he was inexperienced, Kublai allowed local officials free rein. Corruption amongst his officials and aggressive taxation caused large numbers of ethnic Han peasants to flee, which led to a decline in tax revenues. Kublai quickly came to his [[appanage]] in Hebei and ordered reforms. [[Sorghaghtani Beki]] sent new officials to help him and tax laws were revised. Thanks to those efforts, many of the people who fled returned.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe most prominent, and arguably most influential, component of Kublai Khan's early life was his study and a strong attraction to contemporary [[Chinese culture|Han culture]]. Kublai invited Haiyun, the leading Buddhist monk in northern China, to his [[Orda (organization)|ordo]] in Mongolia. When he met Haiyun in [[Karakorum]] in 1242, Kublai asked him about the philosophy of Buddhism. Haiyun named Kublai's son, who was born in 1243, [[Zhenjin]] (Chinese: ''True Gold'').<ref name=\"Man2007p37\">{{harvnb|Man|2007|p=37}}</ref> Haiyun also introduced Kublai to the formerly [[Taoism|Daoist (Taoist)]], and at the time Buddhist monk, Liu Bingzhong.

Kublai received the [[viceroy]]alty over northern China and moved his ordo to central [[Inner Mongolia]]. During his years as viceroy, Kublai managed his territory well, boosted the agricultural output of [[Henan]], and increased social welfare spendings after receiving [[Xi'an]]. These acts received great acclaim from ethnic Han warlords and were essential to the founding of the Yuan dynasty. In 1252, Kublai criticized Mahmud Yalavach, who was never highly valued by his ethnic Han associates, over his cavalier execution of suspects during a judicial review, and Zhao Bi attacked him for his presumptuous attitude toward the throne. M\u00f6ngke dismissed Mahmud Yalavach, which met with resistance from Han Confucian-trained officials.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Franke |editor1-first=Herbert |editor2-last=Twitchett |editor2-first=Denis C. |title=The Cambridge History of China: Volume 6, Alien Regimes and Border States, 907\u20131368 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iN9Tdfdap5MC |year=1994 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-24331-5 |page=381 |access-date=2015-11-15 |archive-date=2016-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617190059/https://books.google.com/books?id=iN9Tdfdap5MC |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1253, Kublai was ordered to attack [[Yunnan]] and he tried to ask the [[Dali Kingdom]] to submit.

The Mongols fought as a united force, not as individuals, and bombarded the samurai with exploding missiles and showered them with arrows. Eventually, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the coastal zone inland to a fortress. The Mongol forces did not chase the fleeing Japanese into an area about which they lacked reliable intelligence.  In a number of individual skirmishes, known collectively as the K\u014dan Campaign (\u5f18\u5b89\u306e\u5f79) or the \"Second Battle of Hakata Bay\", the Mongol forces were driven back to their ships by the Samurai. The Japanese army was heavily outnumbered, but had fortified the coastal line with two-meter high walls, and was easily able to repulse the Mongolian forces that were launched against it.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Takezaki suenaga ekotoba3.jpg|thumb|350px|Japanese [[samurai]] boarding Yuan ships in 1281.]]\n\n[[Maritime archaeology|Maritime archaeologist]] Kenzo Hayashida led the investigation that discovered the wreckage of the second invasion fleet off the western coast of [[Takashima District, Shiga]]. His team's findings strongly indicate that Kublai rushed to invade Japan and attempted to construct his enormous fleet in one year, a task that should have taken up to five years. This forced the Chinese to use any available ships, including river boats. Most importantly, the Chinese, under Kublai's control, built many ships quickly in order to contribute to the fleets in both of the invasions. Hayashida theorizes that, had Kublai used standard, well-constructed ocean-going ships with curved keels to prevent capsizing, his navy might have survived the journey to and from Japan and might have conquered it as intended. In October 2011, a wreck, possibly one of Kublai's invasion craft, was found off the coast of [[Nagasaki]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-25/asia/world_asia_japan-archaeology-shipwreck_1_fleet-ship-invasion?_s=PM:ASIA |title=Shipwreck may be part of Kublai Khan's lost fleet |date=October 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027212311/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-10-25/asia/world_asia_japan-archaeology-shipwreck_1_fleet-ship-invasion?_s=PM:ASIA |archive-date=October 27, 2011 }}</ref> David Nicolle wrote in ''The Mongol Warlords'', \"Huge losses had also been suffered in terms of casualties and sheer expense, while the myth of Mongol invincibility had been shattered throughout eastern Asia.\" He also wrote that Kublai was determined to mount a third invasion, despite the horrendous cost to the economy and to his and Mongol prestige of the first two defeats, and only his death and the unanimous agreement of his advisers not to invade prevented a third attempt.<ref>Nicolle, David ''The Mongol Warlords''</ref>\n\n===Invasions of Vietnam===\n{{main|Mongol invasions of Vietnam}}\nKublai Khan invaded [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]/Annam (now Vietnam) in a total of five separate incursions between 1257-92, with major campaigns in 1258, 1285, and 1287.

A friend of Zhang's, [[Guo Shoujing]], accompanied him on this mission. Guo was interested in engineering, was an expert astronomer and skilled instrument maker, and he understood that good astronomical observations depended on expertly made instruments. Guo began to construct astronomical instruments, including water clocks for accurate timing and [[armillary sphere]]s that represented the celestial globe. [[Turkestan]]i architect Ikhtiyar al-Din, also known as \"Igder\", designed the buildings of the city of the Khagan, Khanbaliq (Dadu).<ref>{{cite book |last=Schinz |first=Alfred |title=The Magic Square |page=291}}</ref> Kublai also employed foreign artists to build his new capital; one of them, a [[Newar people|Newar]] named [[Araniko]], built the White [[Stupa]] that was the largest structure in Khanbaliq/Dadu.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lall |first=Kesar |title=A Nepalese Miscellany |page=32}}</ref>\n\nZhang advised Kublai that Guo was a leading expert in hydraulic engineering. Kublai knew the importance of water management for irrigation, transport of grain, and flood control, and he asked Guo to look at these aspects in the area between Dadu (now Beijing) and the Yellow River. To provide Dadu with a new supply of water, Guo found the Baifu spring in Mount Shen and had a {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} channel built to move water to Dadu. He proposed connecting the water supply across different river basins, built new canals with sluices to control the water level, and achieved great success with the improvements he made.

In 1264 he was asked to go to [[Gansu]] to repair the damage that had been caused to the irrigation systems by the years of war during the Mongol advance through the region. Guo travelled extensively along with his friend Zhang taking notes of the work needed to be done to unblock damaged parts of the system and to make improvements to its efficiency.

Nomukhan, after returning from captivity in the [[Golden Horde]], expressed resentment that Zhenjin had been made heir apparent, but he was banished to the north. An official proposed that Kublai should abdicate in favor of Zhenjin in 1285, a suggestion that angered Kublai, who refused to see Zhenjin.

The failure of the military campaigns in Vietnam and Japan also haunted him. Kublai turned to food and drink for comfort, became grossly overweight, and suffered gout and diabetes. The emperor overindulged in alcohol and the traditional meat-rich Mongol diet, which may have contributed to his gout. Kublai sank into depression due to the loss of his family, his poor health and advancing age. Kublai tried every medical treatment available, from Korean shamans to Vietnamese doctors, and remedies and medicines, but to no avail. At the end of 1293, the emperor refused to participate in the traditional New Years' ceremony. Before his death, Kublai passed the seal of Crown Prince to Zhenjin's son [[Tem\u00fcr Khan|Tem\u00fcr]], who would become the next Khagan of the Mongol Empire and the second ruler of the Yuan dynasty.
