She hosted several New York children's series through the decade. On July 5, 1953, Lewis made her television hosting debut on ''Facts N'Fun'' on [[NBC]]-owned WRCA-TV. The program was a variety show in which she engaged her viewers and studio audience members in games, hobbies, craft making, songs, stories, informational segments, interviews with guest performers and personalities. She also performed witty comedy skits with two [[Ventriloquist's dummy|ventriloquist's dummies]], Samson and Taffy Twinkle. The one hour show remained on the air until September 26, 1953.<ref name=IMDB/>\n\nShe moved to [[WPIX]] in 1953 to replace [[Ted Steele (bandleader)|Ted Steele]] as host of ''Kartoon Klub'', which featured a variety format with a live studio audience. Lewis performed with Randy Rocket and Taffy Twinkle, and the program also featured reruns of ''[[Crusader Rabbit]]'' cartoons. ''Kartoon Klub'' later changed its title to ''Shari & Her Friends'' on September 23, 1956, and then to ''Shariland'' a month later. Lewis won New York-area [[Emmy Award]]s for her work on ''Shariland'' and a succeeding series on WRCA-TV, ''Hi Mom'' (1957\u20131959), which introduced Charlie Horse, Hush Puppy, and Wing Ding. Lamb Chop, also appearing, had previously been introduced during Lewis's guest appearance on ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' in March 1956.<ref name=IMDB/>\n[[File:Shari lewis 1960.JPG|left|thumb|Lewis with her puppets, Lamb Chop and Charlie Horse, 1960]]\nNBC gave Lewis her first network program, ''[[The Shari Lewis Show]]'', which debuted on October 1, 1960, replacing ''[[Howdy Doody|The Howdy Doody Show]]''. The show ran until September 28, 1963, and featured such characters as Hush Puppy, Charlie Horse, Lamb Chop, and Wing Ding, a black crow. Lamb Chop, which was little more than a sock with eyes, served as a sassy alter-ego for Lewis. Hush Puppy had a Southern accent with a reserved, shy personality, while Charlie Horse was a slow-witted, goofy character.\n\nIn 1961, she played title character Dulie Hudson in ''[[David Westheimer|Watching Out for Dulie]]'', a ''[[The United States Steel Hour|United States Steel Hour]]'' production. She occasionally guest-starred in TV shows such as ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', and ''[[Love, American Style]]''.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0507741/?ref_=sr_1|title=Shari Lewis|work=IMDb|access-date=December 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1960s until the early 1980s, she appeared in a number of British shows, such as [[Val Doonican|the ''Val Doonican Show'']] and the ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]''.<ref name=IMDB/> In 1975, Lewis briefly hosted another, syndicated puppet show called ''The Shari Show''.
