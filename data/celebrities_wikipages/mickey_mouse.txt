The longtime mascot of [[The Walt Disney Company]], Mickey is an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[mouse]] who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves. Taking inspiration from such [[Silent film|silent film]] personalities as [[Charlie Chaplin]]\u2019s [[The Tramp|Tramp]], Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic [[underdog]] who gets by on pluck and ingenuity.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jackson |first=Kathy |title=Mickey and the Tramp: Walt Disney's Debt to Charlie Chaplin |publisher=The Journal of American Culture |year=2003 |edition=26th |pages=439\u2013444}}</ref> The character\u2019s status as a small mouse was personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice, the latter of which was originally provided by Disney. Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters of all time.\n\nCreated as a replacement for a prior Disney character, [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]], Mickey first appeared in the short ''[[Plane Crazy]]'', debuting publicly in the short film ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' (1928), one of the first [[Sound film|sound cartoons]]. The character was originally to be named \u201cMortimer Mouse\u201d, until [[Lillian Disney]] instead suggested \u201cMickey\u201d during a train ride. The character went on to appear in over 130 films, including ''[[The Band Concert]]'' (1935), ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'' (1938), and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]], one of which, ''[[Lend a Paw]]'', won the award in [[14th Academy Awards|1941]]. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\nBeginning in 1930, Mickey has also been featured extensively in [[comic strip]]s and comic books. The [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]], drawn primarily by [[Floyd Gottfredson]], ran for 45 years. Mickey has also appeared in comic books such as ''[[Mickey Mouse (comic book)|Mickey Mouse]]'', [[Disney comics#Italy|Disney Italy]]'s ''[[Topolino]]'' and ''[[MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine|MM \u2013 Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine]]'', and ''[[Wizards of Mickey]]''. Mickey also features in television series such as ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' (1955\u20131996) and others. He appears in other media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks.\n\nMickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend [[Minnie Mouse]], his pet dog [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], his friends [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]], and his nemesis [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]], among others (see [[Mickey Mouse universe]]). Though originally characterized as a cheeky [[lovable rogue]], Mickey was rebranded over time as a [[nice guy]], usually seen as an honest and bodacious [[hero]]. In 2009, Disney began to rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his friendly, well-meaning persona and reintroducing the more adventurous and stubborn sides of his personality, beginning with the video game ''[[Epic Mickey]]''.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|date=November 4, 2009|title=After Mickey's Makeover, Less Mr. Nice Guy|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/business/media/05mickey.html?hp|access-date=November 5, 2009}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===Film===\n{{see also|Mickey Mouse (film series)}}\n\n====Origin====\n[[File:Mickey Mouse concept art.jpg|thumb|right|[[Concept art]] of Mickey from early 1928, from the collection of [[The Walt Disney Family Museum]].

Ongoing conflicts between Disney and Mintz and the revelation that several animators from the Disney studio would eventually leave to work for Mintz's company ultimately resulted in Disney cutting ties with Oswald. Among the few people who stayed at the Disney studio were animator [[Ub Iwerks]], apprentice artist [[Les Clark]], and [[Wilfred Jackson]]. On his train ride home from New York, Walt brainstormed ideas for a new cartoon character.\n\nMickey Mouse was conceived in secret while Disney produced the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were also rejected. (They would later turn up as [[Clarabelle Cow]] and [[Horace Horsecollar]].) A male frog was also rejected, which later showed up in Iwerks' own ''[[Flip the Frog]]'' series.<ref name=\"Kenworthy\">{{Cite book|last=Kenworthy|first=John|title=The Hand Behind the Mouse|edition=Disney|location=New York|year=2001|pages=53\u201354}}</ref> Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.<ref name=\"conv\">Walt Disney: Conversations (Conversations With Comic Artists Series) by Kathy Merlock Jackson with Walt Disney \" {{ISBN|1-57806-713-8}} page 120</ref> In 1925, [[Hugh Harman]] drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney.

It was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks again served as the head animator, assisted by Johnny Cannon, [[Les Clark]], Wilfred Jackson and [[Dick Lundy (animator)|Dick Lundy]]. This short was intended as a parody of [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''[[Steamboat Bill, Jr.]]'', first released on May 12 of the same year. Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced, it was the first to find a distributor, and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey's debut. ''Willie'' featured changes to Mickey's appearance (in particular, simplifying his eyes to large dots) that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous Walt Disney films.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Walt-Disney-Treasures-Mickey-Mouse/dp/B00006II6O Walt Disney Treasures \u2013 Mickey Mouse in Black and White (1932)] at [[Amazon.com]]; the product description of this Disney-produced DVD set describes ''Steamboat Willie'' as Mickey's debut.</ref><ref name=\"IMDb\">{{IMDb title|0019422}}</ref>\n\nThe cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action. [[Fleischer Studios]], headed by brothers [[Dave Fleischer|Dave]] and [[Max Fleischer]], had already released a number of sound cartoons using the [[Phonofilm|DeForest]] system in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film. For ''Willie'', Disney had the sound recorded with a [[click track]] that kept the musicians on the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the \"Turkey in the Straw\" sequence when Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments. Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film's original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, [[Carl Stalling]] and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons. [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] took over the role in 1946, but Walt provided Mickey's voice again from 1955 to 1959 for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' television series on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nAudiences at the time of ''Steamboat Willie''{{'}}s release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes. [[Sound film]]s or \"talkies\" were still considered innovative. The first feature-length movie with dialogue sequences, ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'' starring [[Al Jolson]], was released on October 6, 1927. Within a year of its success, most United States movie theaters had installed sound film equipment. Walt Disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and, arguably, managed to succeed. Most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to Disney. As a result, Mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time. Walt Disney soon worked on adding sound to both ''Plane Crazy'' and ''The Gallopin' Gaucho'' (which had originally been silent releases) and their new release added to Mickey's success and popularity. A fourth Mickey short, ''[[The Barn Dance]]'', was also put into production; however, Mickey does not actually speak until ''[[The Karnival Kid]]'' in 1929 (see below). After ''Steamboat Willie'' was released, Mickey became a close competitor to [[Felix the Cat]], and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons. By 1929, Felix would lose popularity among theater audiences, and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all future Felix cartoons in sound as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toontracker.com/felix/felix.htm |title=Felix the Cat |publisher=Toontracker.com |access-date=April 8, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126060635/http://www.toontracker.com/felix/felix.htm |archive-date=January 26, 2012 }}</ref> Unfortunately, audiences did not respond well to Felix's transition to sound and by 1930, Felix had faded from the screen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100434|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628135144/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100434|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 28, 2009|work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture|title=Felix the Cat|first=Ian|last=Gordon|year=2002}}</ref>\n\n====Black and white films (1929\u20131935)====\nIn Mickey's early films he was often characterized not as a hero, but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse. ''[[The Barn Dance]]'' (March 14, 1929) is the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete. ''[[The Opry House]]'' (March 28, 1929) was the first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves. Mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit. The three lines on the back of Mickey's gloves represent darts in the gloves' fabric extending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the era.\n\n''[[When the Cat's Away (1929 film)|When the Cat's Away]]'' (April 18, 1929), essentially a remake of the ''[[Alice Comedies|Alice Comedy]]'', \"Alice Rattled by Rats\", was an unusual appearance for Mickey. Although Mickey and Minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics, they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community of many other mice as pests in a home. Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting. In appearances with real humans, Mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high.<ref>Mickey was first pictured with a real human in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' in silhouette. Later a famous statue of Mickey and Walt Disney at Disneyland would maintain Mickey's size.</ref> The next Mickey short was also unusual. ''[[The Barnyard Battle]]'' (April 25, 1929) was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat. ''[[The Karnival Kid]]'' (1929) was the first time Mickey spoke. Before this he had only whistled, laughed, and grunted. His first words were \"Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\" said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival. ''[[Mickey's Follies]]'' (1929) introduced the song \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\" which would become the theme song for ''Mickey Mouse'' films for the next several years. The same song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of 1930s theater-based Mickey Mouse Clubs.<ref name=\"club1\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.disneyshorts.org/shorts.aspx?shortID=133|title=Disney Shorts: 1930: Minnie's Yoo Hoo|access-date=November 13, 2011|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402204042/http://www.disneyshorts.org/shorts.aspx?shortID=133|archive-date=April 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>Polsson, Ken (June 2, 2010).

Shortly before the release of the film, Iwerks left to start his own studio, bankrolled by Disney's then-distributor [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]]. Powers and Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal. It was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney's cartoons that Powers made the deal with Iwerks, who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio. The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey's career, as well as that of Walt Disney. Walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since 1919. Mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction or animation of several of the shorts released till this point. Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons credited them as \"A Walt Disney Comic, drawn by Ub Iwerks\". Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone.\n\nDisney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series, and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As the [[Great Depression]] progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members.<ref>Polsson, Ken (June 2, 2010).

Ken Polsson personal page.</ref>\n\nAbout this time, story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited in the types of gags they could present. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films, allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' (1934), Mickey first appeared with [[Donald Duck]] who had been introduced earlier that year in the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.\n\n====Color films (1935\u20131953)====\n[[File:Mickey - The Band Concert.png|thumb|right|Mickey in ''[[The Band Concert]]'' (1935)]]\n[[File:Mickey - Fantasia.jpg|thumb|Mickey in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940)]]\n\nMickey first appeared animated in color in ''[[Parade of the Award Nominees]]'' in 1932; however, the film strip was created for the [[5th Academy Awards]] ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with ''[[The Band Concert]]''. The [[Technicolor]] film process was used in the film production. Here Mickey conducted the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'', but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, ''The Band Concert'' was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt would put Mickey back on top once again, and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal.<ref name=\"solomon1\">{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousegoldenage/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611022804/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousegoldenage/index.html|archive-date=June 11, 2008|title=The Golden Age of Mickey Mouse|author=Solomon, Charles|publisher=Disney.com guest services}}</ref> Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.\n\nHowever, by 1938, the more manic [[Donald Duck]] would surpass the passive Mickey, resulting in a redesign of the mouse between 1938 and 1940 that put Mickey at the peak of his popularity.<ref name=\"solomon1\" /> The second half of the 1930s saw the character [[Goofy]] reintroduced as a series regular. Together, Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy would go on several adventures together. Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey's most critically acclaimed films, including ''[[Mickey's Fire Brigade]]'' (1935), ''[[Moose Hunters]]'' (1937), ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'' (1937), ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'' (1937), ''[[Boat Builders (film)|Boat Builders]]'' (1938), and ''[[Mickey's Trailer]]'' (1938). Also during this era, Mickey would star in ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]'' (1938), an adaptation of ''[[The Valiant Little Tailor]]'', which was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nMickey was redesigned by animator [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]] which was first seen in ''[[The Pointer]]'' (1939). Instead of having solid black eyes, Mickey was given white eyes with pupils, a Caucasian skin colored face, and a pear-shaped body. In the 1940s, he changed once more in ''[[The Little Whirlwind]]'', where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades, lost his tail, got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy. But this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in \"''The Pointer''\", with the exception of his pants. In his final theatrical cartoons in the 1950s, he was given eyebrows, which were removed in the more recent cartoons.\n\nIn 1940, Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. His screen role as [[The Sorcerer's Apprentice]], set to the [[symphonic poem]] of the same name by [[Paul Dukas]], is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore\u2014filling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with [[Leopold Stokowski]], who conducts all the music heard in ''Fantasia''. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of [[Fantasmic!]], an attraction at the Disney theme parks.\n\nAfter 1940, Mickey's popularity would decline until his 1955 re-emergence as a daily children's television personality.<ref>{{cite web|author=Solomon, Charles|title=Mickey in the Post-War Era|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousepostwar/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615165949/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousepostwar/index.html|archive-date=June 15, 2008|publisher=Disney.com guest services}}</ref> Despite this, the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943 (winning his only competitive Academy Award\u2014with canine companion [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]\u2014for a short subject, ''Lend a Paw'') and again from 1946 to 1952. In these later cartoons, Mickey was often just a supporting character in his own shorts, where Pluto would be the main character.\n\nThe last regular installment of the ''Mickey Mouse'' film series came in 1953 with ''[[The Simple Things]]'' in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls.\n\n===Television and later films===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:House of Mouse Main Cast.png|thumb|left|Mickey and his friends in ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003)]] -->\n\nIn the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television, particularly with ''The Mickey Mouse Club''. Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as ''Ink & Paint Club'', various forms of the [[Walt Disney anthology television series]], and on home video. Mickey returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'', an adaptation of [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' in which Mickey played [[Bob Cratchit]]. This was followed up in 1990 with ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]''.\n\nThroughout the decades, Mickey Mouse competed with [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Bugs Bunny]] for animated popularity. But in 1988, the two rivals finally shared screen time in the [[Robert Zemeckis]] [[Disney]]/[[Amblin]] film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]''. Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene.\n\nSimilar to his animated inclusion into a live-action film in ''Roger Rabbit'', Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]'' where he met [[Kermit the Frog]]. The two are established in the story as having been old friends, although they have not made any other appearance together outside of this.\n\nHis most recent theatrical cartoon short was 2013's ''[[Get a Horse!]]'' which was preceded by 1995's ''[[Runaway Brain]]'', while from 1999 to 2004, he appeared in direct-to-video features like ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'', ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'' and the computer-animated ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]''.\n\nMany television series have centered on Mickey, such as the ABC shows ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' (1999\u20132000), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), [[Disney Channel]]'s ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures]]'' (2017\u20132021) and ''[[Mickey Mouse Funhouse]]'' (2021\u2013).<ref name=\"Mickey Mouse Funhouse\">{{cite press release|title=\"Jump Into Wow\" This Summer on Disney Junior with \"Marvel's Spidey and His Amazing Friends\" and \"Mickey Mouse Funhouse\"|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2021/06/16/jump-into-wow-this-summer-on-disney-junior-with-marvels-spidey-and-his-amazing-friends-and-mickey-mouse-funhouse-725113/20210616disney01/|publisher=[[Disney Channel]]|via=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=June 16, 2021}}</ref> Prior to all these, Mickey was also featured as an [[unseen character]] in the ''[[Bonkers (American TV series)|Bonkers]]'' episode \"You Oughta Be In Toons\".\n\n[[File:Paul Rudish Mickey Mouse.png|thumb|right|Mickey Mouse, as he appears in the [[Paul Rudish]] years, and the modern era.]]\nIn 2013, [[Disney Channel]] started airing new 3-minute ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' shorts, with animator [[Paul Rudish]] at the helm, incorporating elements of Mickey's late twenties-early thirties look with a contemporary twist.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/mickey-mouse-new-retro-disney-channel-article-1.1286123 \"Mickey Mouse's first new short in 50 years; iconic character gets new retro look for big return to cartoon shorts to be featured on Disney Channel,\"] Don Kaplan, ''New York Daily News'', December 3, 2013</ref> The creative team behind the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' reboot]] had hoped to have Mickey Mouse in the series, but this idea was rejected by Disney executives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://suspendersofdisbelief.tumblr.com/post/155311728751/why-cant-you-have-mickey-in-duck-tales|title=Frank Angones and the Suspenders of Disbelief|date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> However, this did not stop them from including a watermelon shaped like Mickey Mouse that Donald Duck made and used like a ventriloquist dummy (to the point where he had perfectly replicated his voice (supplied by [[Chris Diamantopoulos]])) while he was stranded on a deserted island during the season two finale.<ref name=\"Moonvasion!\">{{cite episode|title=Moonvasion!|series=DuckTales|air-date=September 12, 2019|season=2|number=47}}</ref> On November 10, 2020, the series was revived as ''[[The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse]]'' and premiered on [[Disney+]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Deitchman|first=Beth|title=JUST ANNOUNCED: The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse Comes to Disney+ in November|url=https://d23.com/just-announced-the-wonderful-world-of-mickey-mouse-comes-to-disney-in-november/|work=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|date=September 14, 2020|access-date=September 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, ABC television announced a two-hour prime time special, ''[[Mickey's 90th Spectacular]]'', in honor of Mickey's 90th birthday.

Walt Disney was approached by [[King Features Syndicate]] with the offer to license Mickey and his [[supporting character]]s for use in a comic strip. Disney accepted and [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'']] made its first appearance on January 13, 1930.<ref>{{cite web|title=When Mickey's Career Turned a Page|url=https://d23.com/first-mickey-mouse-comic-strip/ |work=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|date=January 13, 2015|access-date=July 27, 2022}}</ref> The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to Ub Iwerks and inking to [[Win Smith]]. The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of \"''Plane Crazy''\". Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast. The strips first released between January 13, 1930, and March 31, 1930, has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title ''\"Lost on a Desert Island''\". Animation historian Jim Korkis notes \"After the eighteenth strip, Iwerks left and his inker, Win Smith, continued drawing the gag-a-day format.\"<ref name=\"jimhillmedia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/09/10/1097.aspx|title=The Uncensored Mouse|last=Korkis|first=Jim|date=August 10, 2003|work=Jim Hill Media}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1930, after Iwerks' departure, Disney was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip, assigning the art to Win Smith. However, Disney's focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well. Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script, draw, and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation.\n\nDisney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio. He selected [[Floyd Gottfredson]], a recently hired employee. At the time Gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment. Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation. Gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this \"temporary\" assignment from May 5, 1930, to November 15, 1975.\n\nWalt Disney's last script for the strip appeared May 17, 1930.<ref name=\"jimhillmedia.com\"/> Gottfredson's first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as ''Mickey Mouse in Death Valley''. This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and [[Pete (Disney)|Black Pete]] as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer [[Sylvester Shyster]] and Minnie's uncle [[Mortimer Mouse]]. The Death Valley narrative was followed by ''Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers'', first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced [[Marcus Mouse]] and his wife as Minnie's parents.\n\nStarting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey's versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While Disney and his [[cartoon]] shorts would continue to focus on comedy, the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.\n\nFloyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as ''Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion'' (1936) and ''The Gleam'' (1942). He also created the [[Phantom Blot]], [[Eega Beeva]], Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, [[Manuel Gonzales]], [[Carson Van Osten]], Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and [[Daan Jippes]]; writers included [[Ted Osborne]], [[Merrill De Maris]], [[Bill Walsh (producer)|Bill Walsh]], Dick Shaw, [[Roy Williams (artist)|Roy Williams]], Del Connell, and [[Floyd Norman]].\n\nThe next artist to leave his mark on the character was [[Paul Murry]] in [[Dell Comics]]. His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a specialty until Murry's first serial for ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' in 1953 (\"The Last Resort\"). In the same period, [[Romano Scarpa]] in Italy for the magazine ''Topolino'' began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the [[Phantom Blot]] and [[Eega Beeva]] along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep-Bleep. While the stories at [[Western Publishing]] during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of [[Sherlock Holmes]], in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures. This renaissance has been spearheaded by [[Byron Erickson]], [[David Gerstein]], [[Noel Van Horn]], [[Michael T. Gilbert]] and [[C\u00e9sar Ferioli]].\n\nIn Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, the most famous being ''[[Topolino]]'' in Italy from 1932 onward, ''[[Le Journal de Mickey]]'' in France from 1934 onward, ''[[Don Miki]]'' in Spain and the Greek ''[[Miky Maous]]''.\n\nMickey was the main character for the series'' [[MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine]]'', published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga ''[[Wizards of Mickey]]''.\n\nIn 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called \u201cSameer\u201d. He became very popular in Egypt and got a comic book with his name. Mickey's comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since 1959 by \u201cDar Al-Hilal\u201d and they were successful, however Dar Al-Hilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney. The comics were re-released by \"Nahdat Masr\" in 2004 and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbookguide.wordpress.com/2011/03/10/mickey-mouse-in-egypt/|title=Mickey Mouse In Egypt!

Disney employees [[John Hench]] and [[Marc Davis (animator)|Marc Davis]] believed that this design was part of Mickey's success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences.\n\nMickey's circular design is most noticeable in his ears. In animation in the 1940s, Mickey's ears were animated in a more realistic perspective. Later, they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was facing. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. The circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey.\n\nIn 1938, animator [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]] redesigned Mickey's body away from its circular design to a pear-shaped design. Colleague [[Ward Kimball]] praised Moore for being the first animator to break from Mickey's \"[[Rubber hose animation|rubber hose]], round circle\" design. Although Moore himself was nervous at first about changing Mickey, Walt Disney liked the new design and told Moore \"that's the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on.\"\n\nEach of Mickey's hands has only three fingers and a thumb. Disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision, explaining, \"Artistically five digits are too many for a mouse. His hand would look like a bunch of bananas. Financially, not having an extra finger in each of 45,000 drawings that make up a six and one-half minute short has saved the Studio millions.\" In the film ''[[The Opry House]]'' (1929), Mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body. The use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters, particularly with later Disney characters, but also with non-Disney characters such as [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Woody Woodpecker]], [[Mighty Mouse]], [[Mario]], and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic The Hedgehog]].\n\nMickey's eyes, as drawn in ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' and ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'', were large and white with black outlines. In ''[[Steamboat Willie]],'' the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his head. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils, while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 on the cover of a party program, and in animation the following year with the release of ''[[The Pointer]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Holliss|first=Richard|author2=Brian Sibley|title=Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse: His Life and Times|url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysmicke00holl|url-access=registration|year=1986|publisher=[[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Row]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-06-015619-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysmicke00holl/page/40 40\u201345]}}</ref> Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in ''[[The Simple Things]]'' (1953) and in the comic strip, although he does not have eyebrows in his subsequent appearances.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nOriginally characters had black hands, but [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]] said this was changed for visibility reasons.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]]| date = 2002| title = [[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Two#Mickey Mouse in Black & White|Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Two- ''Mickey Mouse in Black & White'']] (DVD), Disc 1, Bonus Features: ''Frank and Ollie... and Mickey'' featurette (2002)| medium = DVD| language = en| publisher = [[The Walt Disney Company]]| quote = \"There was an interesting bit of development there.

When Mickey is not wearing his red shorts, he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat (''[[The Band Concert]]'', ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''), red overalls (''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', ''[[Boat Builders (film)|Boat Builders]]''), a red cloak (''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]''), a red coat (''[[Squatter's Rights (film)|Squatter's Rights]]'', ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''), or a red shirt (''Mickey Down Under'', ''[[The Simple Things]]'').\n\n===Voice actors===\n[[File:Walt disney portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] (1901\u20131966), the co-creator of Mickey Mouse and founder of [[The Walt Disney Company]], was the original voice of Mickey.]]\n\nA large part of Mickey's screen persona is his famously shy, [[falsetto]] voice.

King Mickey wields the [[Keyblade]], a weapon in the form of a key that has the power to open any lock and combat darkness. ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', featuring a darker version of the Disney universe, was released in 2010 for the [[Wii]].

In the first issue, cartoonist [[Dan O'Neill]] depicted Mickey and Minnie Mouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs.
