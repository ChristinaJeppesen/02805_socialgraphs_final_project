While at Columbia College Chicago, his broadcasting instructor Al Parker told him that a local radio station ([[WEDC]]) was looking for a newsman. Sajak applied for the job and was hired to work from midnight to 6:00 am. In 1968, he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to [[Vietnam]], where he served as a disc jockey on [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio]]. On [[American Heroes Channel|the Military Channel]]'s program, ''An Officer and a Movie'', Sajak admitted to botching [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1969 Christmas broadcast to the troops; he accidentally cut the feed off prematurely. Upon realizing the error, Sajak decided it would be best not to resume the feed. In the early 1970s, he DJed for a year for a [[Murray, Kentucky]] radio station.<ref>{{cite news |first=Diane K.|last=Shah|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/11/magazine/the-good-fortunes-of-pat-sajak.html?src=pm&pagewanted=4 |title=The Good Fortunes of Pat Sajak |page=4 |date=December 11, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=May 9, 2014 }}</ref> Also in the early 1970s, Sajak began DJing at 50,000-watt [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]; at the time, WSM was playing [[pop music]] during the day, and he was the 2:30\u20135:00 pm afternoon personality. The radio station's television sister, WSM-TV (now [[WSMV-TV|WSMV]]), brought Sajak on screen, first as a voiceover artist making station identifications and anchoring the five-minute newscasts during [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today Show]]'', then as a weekend and substitute weatherman, where he became acquainted with anchor [[Dan Miller (journalist)|Dan Miller]]. In 1977, [[KNBC]]-TV in [[Los Angeles]] was looking for a weather reporter and spotted Sajak working in Nashville. He accepted KNBC's request for him to be a full-time weather reporter for the station.\n\nIn 1981, [[Merv Griffin]] asked Sajak if he would be interested in taking over the duties as host on ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' from [[Chuck Woolery]]. However, [[Fred Silverman]], the president and CEO of NBC, rejected his hiring, claiming Sajak was too local, and Griffin responded by imposing a moratorium on new tapings until Sajak was hired.<ref>Griffin, Merv. ''Merv: Making the Good Life Last.'' New York: Pocket Books, 2003, page 101</ref> The issue became moot when Silverman was dismissed due to repeated programming failures and replaced by [[Brandon Tartikoff]]. Sajak, who had already hosted two game show pilots in 1980, ''Press Your Luck'' for [[Ralph Edwards]] (no relation to the [[Press Your Luck|1983 CBS game show of the same name]]) and ''Puzzlers'' for [[Mark Goodson]], accepted the position. Sajak hosted both the daytime (NBC) and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] evening versions of ''Wheel'' from 1983 to 1989 and continues to host the latter version. With Sajak returning for his 36th season in 2018\u201319, he became the longest-running host of any game show, surpassing [[Bob Barker]], who hosted ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' from 1972 to 2007.
