Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", personas he had devised. He became known as the '''Killer Clown''' due to his public services as a clown prior to the discovery of his crimes.\n\nGacy committed all of his murders inside his [[ranch-style house]] near [[Norridge, Illinois|Norridge]], a village in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park Township]] in [[Chicago metropolitan area|suburban Chicago]]. Typically, he would lure a victim to his home and dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]]. He would then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, and three others were buried elsewhere on his property; four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], in 1968 and was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, but served eighteen months. He murdered his first victim in 1972, had murdered twice more by the end of 1975, and murdered at least thirty subsequent victims after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. The investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nHis conviction for thirty-three murders (by one individual) then covered the most homicides in United States legal history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]], on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (1900\u20131969) and Marion Elaine Robison (1908\u20131989).{{sfn|Foreman|1992|pp=50\u201358}}<ref>\"Illinois, Cook County Marriages, 1871\u20131920,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q21V-G1HK {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008222643/https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q21V-G1HK |date=October 8, 2021 }} : 28 November 2018), John Gacy and Marion E Robertson, 07 Jan 1939, citing Cook County Clerk.

His father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=218\u2013219}} The same year, a family friend and contractor would sometimes [[child molestation|molest]] Gacy in his truck.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=17\u201321}} Gacy never told his father about this, afraid that his father would blame him.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|pp=50\u201358}}\n\nGacy was an overweight and unathletic child. Because of a heart condition, he was told to avoid all sports at school.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|pp=50\u201358}} During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was hospitalized on occasion because of these episodes and also, in 1957, for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in hospital and attributed the decline of his grades to missing school. His father suspected these episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention and openly accused his son of faking the condition as Gacy lay in a hospital bed.{{sfn|Cavendish|1997|p=5}} Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31\u201336}}{{efn|Gacy attended [[Cooley Vocational High School]], but transferred to [[Prosser Vocational High School]] after one year.

On one occasion in 1957, he witnessed Gacy's father emerging drunk from the family basement to begin belittling, then hitting his son for no apparent reason.{{efn|Gacy's father would drink alone in the family basement almost every evening before dinner, where his family would frequently hear him talking aloud to himself or holding imaginary conversations with friends who had fallen in World War&nbsp;I.{{sfn|Hunter|2022|p=24}} The door to this location was always locked and strictly off-limits to his family, and became known to Gacy as his father's \"sacred spot\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=22}}}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene as her son simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\". According to the friend, Gacy never struck his father back during these altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at age 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This led to more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:patsy|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated his decision to become involved in politics was actually to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nThe same year Gacy's political involvement began, his father bought him a car. He kept the vehicle's title in his own name until Gacy had finished paying for it. These monthly payments took several years for him to complete. His father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as he said. In April 1962, Gacy purchased an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]], keeping the component for three days. Gacy recalled he felt \"totally sick\" and \"drained\" after this incident.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201355}}\n\n====Las Vegas====\nHours after his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left home and drove to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. He found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. As a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room. He worked there for three months, observing morticians embalming dead bodies and occasionally serving as a [[pallbearer]].{{sfn|Hunter|2022|p=52}} Gacy later confessed that one evening, while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of [[Acute stress disorder|shock]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] twice, while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He claimed the bodies were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=342\u2013351}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201355}} His father agreed, and the same day he drove back to Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=342\u2013351}}\n\n====Springfield====\nOn returning home, Gacy enrolled at [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]], despite having failed to graduate from high school. He graduated in 1963 and took a management trainee position with the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201355}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred him to [[Springfield, Illinois]], to work as a salesman, and eventually promoted him to manager of his department.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}} In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}}\n\nDuring their courtship, Gacy joined the local [[United States Junior Chamber|Jaycees]] and worked tirelessly for them, being named Key Man in April 1964.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|pp=50\u201358}} That same year, he had his second [[homosexual]] experience. According to Gacy, after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening on his sofa, he agreed; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] on him while he was drunk.{{sfn|Cavendish|1997|p=7}} By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}} The same year, he was named the third most outstanding Jaycee in the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201355}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\n===KFC manager===\nAfter a six-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=218\u2013219}} Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] (KFC) restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa]]. The couple moved there so Gacy could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' former home, which had been vacated for the couple.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of about $134,550 {{as of|2022|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of the restaurant's profits.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201355}}\n\nFollowing the obligatory completion of a management course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with the young men. Gacy gave many of them alcohol before he made sexual advances; if they rebuffed him, he would claim his advances were simply jokes or a test of [[Morality|morals]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"\u2014he had finally earned his father's approval. When Gacy's parents paid a family visit in July 1966, his father privately apologized for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted throughout his son's childhood and adolescence before happily saying, \"Son, I was wrong about you,\" as he shook Gacy's hand.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n===Waterloo Jaycees===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local Jaycees chapter, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing the three KFC restaurants. At meetings, Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201355}} He and other Waterloo Jaycees were also deeply involved in [[wife swapping]], [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}{{sfn|Cavendish|1997|p=7}}\n\nAlthough Gacy was considered ambitious and something of a braggart, the other Jaycees held him in high regard for his fundraising work, and in 1967 named him \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201328}} The same year, Gacy served on the board of directors.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy [[sexually assaulted]] 15-year-old Donald Voorhees Jr., the son of [[Donald E. Voorhees|Donald E. Voorhees]], a local politician and a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house upon the promise of showing him heterosexual [[stag film]]s regularly played at Jaycee events. Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol, allowed him to watch a stag movie, then persuaded him to engage in mutual oral sex, adding, \"You have to have sex with a man before you start having sex with women.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=40\u201357}} Over the following months Gacy similarly abused several other youths, including one whom he encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex on him. Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned to conduct homosexual experiments in the interests of scientific research, and paid them up to $50 each.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees&nbsp;Sr. immediately informed the police, who arrested Gacy and subsequently charged him with performing oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] on Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. The results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to both young men.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=65\u201372}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated\u2014Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees. Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support.

They arrested him the following day. While initially denying any involvement, Schroeder soon confessed to assaulting Voorhees, indicating he had done so at Gacy's request. Police arrested Gacy and laid an additional charge of hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the [[University of Iowa]]. Two doctors examined him over a period of seventeen days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (the clinical term for [[sociopathy]] and/or [[psychopathy]]) and was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society. The doctors concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=256\u2013278}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder|title=Antisocial Personality Disorder|magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City|date=April 19, 2017|access-date=January 13, 2018|archive-date=May 29, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200529122856/https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\nOn November 7, 1968, Gacy pleaded guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to Voorhees, but not guilty to the charges related to other youths.

Gacy told his wife he had been attacked for refusing to pay him for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=112\u2013123}}\n\nIn May 1975, Gacy hired 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci. Two months later, he went to Antonucci's home, knowing the youth had injured his foot in an accident the previous day. The two drank a bottle of wine, then watched a heterosexual [[stag film]] before Gacy wrestled Antonucci to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back. One cuff was loose and Antonucci freed his arm while Gacy was out of the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a [[Scholastic Wrestling|high school wrestler]]\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key, and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. At first, Gacy threatened Antonucci, then calmed down and promised to leave if he would remove the handcuffs. Antonucci agreed and Gacy left. Antonucci later recalled that Gacy told him: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs, you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=112\u2013123}}\n\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy picked up 18-year-old David Cram as he hitchhiked on Elston Avenue.

The next day, Cram and Gacy had several drinks to celebrate his 19th birthday, with Gacy dressed as Pogo. Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs, his wrists cuffed in front of his body rather than behind. He swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself from the handcuffs.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=165\u2013172}}\n\nA month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door intending to rape him, saying, \"Dave, you really don't know who I am.

Some victims were grabbed by force; others conned into believing Gacy (who often carried a sheriff's badge and had spotlights on his black [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile]]) was a policeman.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=166\u2013179}}\n\nGacy usually lured a lone victim to his house, although on more than one occasion Gacy also had what he called \"doubles\"\u2014two victims killed in the same evening.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=350}}{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=239\u2013243}}\n\nInside Gacy's home, his usual [[modus operandi]] was to ply a youth with drink, drugs, or generally gain his trust.

Butkovich's father, a [[Yugoslavs|Yugoslav]] immigrant, called Gacy, who claimed he was happy to help search for his son but was sorry Butkovich had \"run away\". When questioned by police, Gacy said Butkovich and two friends had arrived at his house demanding the overdue pay, but they had reached a compromise and all three had left.

This included seeing him keeping company with young males, hearing his car arrive or depart in the early hours of the morning, or seeing lights in his home switch on and off in the early hours.{{sfn|Cavendish|1997|p=28}} One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, the sounds of muffled high-pitched screaming, shouting, and crying had repeatedly awakened her and her son in the early morning hours.

On returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in Piest's disappearance and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy, Gacy reiterated that he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store.

Police assigned two, two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.{{sfn|Cavendish|1990|p=1915}} These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river earlier that year.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=123\u2013127}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details of Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, then chloroformed, raped and tortured him before dumping him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=84\u201393}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=53\u201355}} An interview with Szyc's mother revealed that several items from her son's apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=99\u2013104}}\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or at his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers more than once.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|p=89}} That afternoon, Cram consented to a police interview, in which he described Gacy's hard-working lifestyle, and \"open-minded\" attitude about sex between men. Cram also revealed that, because of his poor timekeeping, Gacy had once given him a watch, explaining he got it \"from a dead person\".{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|p=71}}{{efn|Cram also informed investigators in this interview Gacy had allowed him to retain a driver's license belonging to a [[DeVry University]] student he found in Gacy's garage in approximately February 1977 in order that he could engage in underage drinking. According to Cram, Gacy also informed him this identification belonged to a deceased individual.}}\n\nInvestigators conducted a formal interview of Rossi on December 17. He informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him, explaining that he had bought the car from Szyc because he needed money to move to [[California]]. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers they suspected to be human hair. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles. One dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay on the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating Piest's body had been present in the vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=84\u201393}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited detectives Albrecht and Hachmeister to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited them into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during the conversation, Gacy remarked: \"You know ... clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|p=90}}{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to display signs of strain from the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=99\u2013104}} The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kimberly Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy. Byers admitted, when contacted in person the following day, that she had worn the jacket on December 11 to shield herself from the cold. She had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the coat to Piest as he left the store, claiming a contractor wanted to speak with him.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=123\u2013127}} This statement contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\n===Second search warrant===\nThe same evening, Rossi was interviewed a second time. This time he was more cooperative. He informed detectives that in the summer of 1977, at Gacy's behest, he had spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of Gacy's house.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=141\u2013145}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant for Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing for the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited the surveillance detectives inside his house again. As officer Robinson distracted Gacy with conversation, officer Schultz walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, the officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]. The officers who had searched Gacy's house previously had failed to notice this, as the house had been cold.{{sfn|Cavendish|1990|p=1915}}\n\nInvestigators interviewed both Cram and Rossi on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had concealed Piest's body, Rossi replied Gacy may have placed the body in the crawl space, adding that he thought Szyc's car was stolen.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=253\u2013262}}{{sfn|Foreman|1992|pp=68\u201377}} Rossi agreed to submit to a [[polygraph]] test. He denied any involvement in Piest's disappearance, also denying any knowledge of his whereabouts. He soon refused to continue the questioning, and Rossi's \"erratic and inconsistent\" responses to questions while attached to the polygraph machine rendered Kozenczak \"unable to render a definite opinion\" as to the truthfulness of his answers.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=141\u2013145}} Rossi did, however, further discuss the trench digging he did in the crawl space and remarked on Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976. He stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale after seeing a clod of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram said Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had once been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and had also dug trenches, which Gacy had explained were for [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] pipes. Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft}} wide, {{convert|6|ft}} long and {{convert|2|ft}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=141\u2013145}}\n\n====Confession====\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a scheduled meeting, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. On his arrival Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. On his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights, Illinois)|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk, pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and said, \"This boy is dead. He's dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|2011|p=126}}\n\nGacy then proceeded to give a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|p=127}} He said he had murdered \"at least thirty\" victims, most of whom he had buried in his crawl space, and had disposed of five other bodies in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[male prostitute]]s\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding he sometimes awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=165\u2013172}} He had buried their bodies in his crawl space as he believed they were his property.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=342\u2013351}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession. Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. On awakening several hours later, Gacy shook his head when informed by Amirante he had confessed to killing approximately 30 people, saying, \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\" Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|p=150}}\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding he knew his arrest was inevitable and that he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells. After leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, who immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him, \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor and friend, Ronald Rhode. Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying, \"I've been a bad boy. I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=253\u2013262}} Gacy left Rhode and drove to Cram's home to meet with Cram and Rossi. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin, praying while he drove.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=152\u2013157}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with lawyer Leroy Stevens on the Northwest Side. As Gacy spoke with Stevens, Cram informed the surveillance officers that Gacy had told him and Rossi that he had confessed to over 30 murders with his lawyers the previous evening. Gacy then had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=253\u2013262}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined the formal [[Draft document|draft]] of their second search warrant, specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. On hearing from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him on a charge of possession and distribution of cannabis in order to hold him in custody, as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented.{{efn|Recreational use of cannabis was illegal in the state of Illinois prior to 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Beginning of a New Age, the End of an Antiquated Viewpoint: Long Lines, Celebrations Mark First Hours of Recreational Marijuana Sales in Illinois|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/marijuana/illinois/ct-legal-weed-first-day-recreational-sales-20200101-fhtdvp4j6naphff6jmnnh6fkqy-story.html|access-date=May 7, 2021|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=January 1, 2020|archive-date=April 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418101653/https://www.chicagotribune.com/marijuana/illinois/ct-legal-weed-first-day-recreational-sales-20200101-fhtdvp4j6naphff6jmnnh6fkqy-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>}}{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=152\u2013157}} At 4:30&nbsp;p.m. on December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, Judge Marvin J.

On their arrival, officers found Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]], flooding the crawl space with water; to clear it, they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space, crawled to the southwest area and began digging.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|pp=50\u201358}} Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder, adding, \"I think this place is full of kids.\" A police photographer then dug in the northeast corner of the crawl space, uncovering a [[patella]]. The two then began digging in the southeast corner, uncovering two lower leg bones.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=166\u2013179}}\n\nThe victims were too decomposed to be Piest.

As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him, but Donnelly finished his testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=331\u2013334}} During Donnelly's cross-examination, one of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=340\u2013345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]] for reasons including that he did not approve of his lawyers' insanity plea; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had wanted to do); that his defense had not called enough medical witnesses, and that the police were lying with regard to verbal statements he had allegedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=342\u2013351}}{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=350\u2013354}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that both counsels had not been denied the opportunity or funds to summon expert witnesses to testify, and that, under the law, he had the choice whether he wished to testify, and was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=309\u2013312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments by both prosecution and defense attorneys began; they concluded the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan spoke first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing his surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\". Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\", Sullivan stated, \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=320\u2013326}}{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=360\u2013374}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante spoke for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=356\u2013364}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\", contending the State had not met their [[Burden of proof (law)|burden]] of proving Gacy sane beyond a reasonable doubt.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=360\u2013374}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and a former business associate of Gacy's named Mickel Ried\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=292\u2013294}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client and asked they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that Gacy was a danger to both himself and to others, and that studying his psychology and behavior would be of benefit to science.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=356\u2013364}}\n\nOn the morning of March 12, William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=356\u2013364}} Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a sham\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of one of the doctors who had examined Gacy in 1968 and had concluded he was an antisocial personality, capable of committing crimes without remorse and unlikely to benefit from social or psychiatric treatment, stating that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would not have been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=360\u2013374}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle removed photos of Gacy's 22 identified victims from a display board and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''\" before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door from Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom. After Kunkle had finished his testimony, the jury retired to consider their verdict.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=360\u2013374}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for less than two hours and found Gacy guilty of 33 charges of murder; he was also found guilty of sexual assault and taking indecent liberties with a child; both convictions in reference to Robert Piest.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=360\u2013374}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pp8rAAAAIBAJ&pg=2750,2719769|title=Gacy Sentenced to Die; Readies Appeals|newspaper=[[Nashua Telegraph]]|via=Google News|date=March 14, 1980|access-date=September 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929110035/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pp8rAAAAIBAJ&pg=2750%2C2719769|archive-date=September 29, 2020}} {{Open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IbZBAAAAIBAJ&pg=6852,3893550|title=Court Refuses to Hear Mass Murderer Case|newspaper=[[The Harlan Daily Enterprise]]|via=Google News|date=March 1, 1985|access-date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201004170530/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IbZBAAAAIBAJ&pg=6852%2C3893550|archive-date=October 4, 2020}} {{Open access}}</ref> At the time, his conviction for 33 murders was the most for which any person in U.S. history had been convicted.<ref name=safe/><ref>{{cite news|last=Rossi|first=Rosalind A.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZLYcAAAAIBAJ&pg=5140,7396894|title=Gacy Sentenced To Die For 33 Deaths|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|date=March 14, 1980|via=Google News|agency=UPI|page=7|access-date=July 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929100753/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZLYcAAAAIBAJ&pg=5140%2C7396894|archive-date=September 29, 2020}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing phase]] of the trial, the jury deliberated for more than two hours before sentencing Gacy to death for each murder committed after the Illinois statute on capital punishment came into effect in June 1977.{{sfn|Sullivan|2000|pp=360\u2013374}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Rossi|first=Rosalind A.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zk80AAAAIBAJ&pg=6679,3103134|title=Mothers Tell Gacy Jury Of Last Time They Saw Sons|newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|date=February 8, 1980|agency=UPI|via=Google News|page=6|access-date=July 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929100525/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zk80AAAAIBAJ&pg=6679%2C3103134|archive-date=September 29, 2020}} {{Open access}}</ref> His execution was set for June 2, 1980.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=387\u2013388}}\n\n==Death row==\nOn being sentenced, Gacy was transferred to the Menard Correctional Center, where he remained [[incarceration|incarcerated]] on death row for 14 years.{{sfn|Amirante|2011|pp=387\u2013388}}\n\nBefore his trial, Gacy initiated contact with [[WLS-TV]] journalist [[Russ Ewing]], to whom he granted numerous interviews between 1979 and 1981.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 27, 2019|title=Russ Ewing, TV News Reporter Who Convinced More Than 115 Suspects to Turn Themselves In, Dies at 95|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fy-tNs6YK9QJ:https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/27/russ-ewing-tv-news-reporter-who-convinced-more-than-suspects-turn-themselves-dies/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk|access-date=August 7, 2020}}</ref> Ewing later collaborated with author [[Tim Cahill (writer)|Tim Cahill]] to publish the book ''Buried Dreams''.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=vi}} The information Gacy divulged to Ewing regarding the circumstances of his first murder would prove instrumental in establishing the identity of his first victim.<ref name=locin>{{cite news|last=Locin|first=Mitchell|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-05-10-8602020800-story.html|title=Gacy's 1st Victim Finally Identified|newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 10, 1986|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200303222247/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1986-05-10-8602020800-story.html|archive-date=March 3, 2020|access-date=October 12, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nOn February 15, 1983, Henry Brisbon, a fellow death row inmate known as the I-57 killer, stabbed Gacy in the upper arm with a sharpened wire as Gacy was participating in a voluntary work program.

His appeals related to issues such as the validity of the first search warrant granted to the Des Plaines police on December 13, 1978, and his objection to his lawyers' insanity plea defense at his trial. Gacy also contended that, although he had \"some knowledge\" of five of the murders (those of McCoy, Butkovich, Godzik, Szyc and Piest), the other 28 murders had been committed by employees who had keys to his house while he was away on business trips.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=342\u2013351}}\n\nIn mid-1984, the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]] upheld Gacy's conviction and ordered his execution by lethal injection on November 14.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=342\u2013351}} Gacy filed an appeal against this decision, which was denied by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on March 4, 1985.
