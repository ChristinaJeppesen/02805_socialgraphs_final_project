minister of Australia]] from 1996 to 2007, holding office as leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]. His eleven-year tenure as prime minister is the second-longest in history, behind only Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who served for eighteen non-consecutive years.\n\nHoward was born in [[Sydney]] and studied law at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], he first stood for office at the [[1968 New South Wales state election]], but lost narrowly. At the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 federal election]], Howard was elected as a [[member of parliament]] (MP) for the [[division of Bennelong]]. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced [[Phillip Lynch]] as [[treasurer of Australia]], remaining in that position until the defeat of [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s government at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. In 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing [[Andrew Peacock]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He led the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal\u2013National coalition]] to the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 federal election]], but lost to [[Bob Hawke]]'s Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995, replacing [[Alexander Downer]], and subsequently led the Coalition to a [[landslide victory]] at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]].\n\nIn his first term, Howard introduced [[Gun laws in Australia|reformed gun laws]] in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]], and controversially implemented [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|a nationwide value-added tax]], breaking a pre-election promise. The [[Howard government]] called a [[snap election]] for [[1998 Australian federal election|1998]], which they won, albeit with a greatly reduced majority. Going into the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 election]], the Coalition trailed behind Labor in [[opinion polling]]. However, in a campaign dominated by national security, Howard introduced [[Pacific Solution|changes to Australia's immigration system]] to deter [[asylum seekers]] from entering the country, and pledged military assistance to the United States following the [[September 11 attacks]]. Due to this, Howard won widespread support, and his government would be narrowly re-elected.\n\nIn Howard's third term in office, Australia contributed troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]], and led the [[International Force for East Timor]]. The Coalition would be re-elected once more at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]]. In his final term in office, his government introduced industrial relations reforms known as  [[WorkChoices]], which proved controversial and unpopular with the public. The Howard government was defeated at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], with the Labor Party's [[Kevin Rudd]] succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat of Bennelong at the election to [[Maxine McKew]], becoming only the second prime minister to do so, after [[Stanley Bruce]] at the [[1929 Australian federal election|1929 election]].\n\nFollowing this loss, Howard retired from politics, but has remained active in political discourse, and published his autobiography, [[Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography|''Lazarus Rising'']], in 2010.\n\n==Early and personal life==\n[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photograph of John Howard as a boy, taken in the 1940s|Howard as a boy, 1940s]]\nHoward is the fourth son of Mona (''n\u00e9e'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]].

Following an unsuccessful leadership challenge by [[Andrew Peacock]] to unseat Fraser as prime minister, Howard was [[1982 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill|elected deputy leader]] of the Liberal Party in April 1982. His election depended largely on the support of the \"drys\", and he became the party's champion of the growing free-market lobby.{{sfnp|Kelly|1994|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe economic crises of the early 1980s brought Howard into conflict with the [[Keynesian]] Fraser. As the economy headed towards the worst recession since the 1930s, Fraser pushed an expansionary fiscal position much to Howard's and Treasury's horror. With his authority as treasurer being flouted, Howard considered resigning in July 1982, but, after discussions with his wife and senior advisor [[John Hewson]], he decided to \"tough it out\".{{sfnp|Kelly|1994|pp=50\u201353}} The 1982 wages explosion\u2014wages rose 16 per cent across the country\u2014resulted in [[stagflation]]; unemployment touched double-digits and inflation peaked at 12.5% (official interest rates peaked at 21%).<ref>{{Citation | title =F01 Interest rates and yields&nbsp;\u2013 money market | publisher =[[Reserve Bank of Australia]] | url =http://www.rba.gov.au/Statistics/Bulletin/F01hist.xls | format =Excel file |access-date=29 August 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070729185829/http://www.rba.gov.au/Statistics/Bulletin/F01hist.xls |archive-date = 29 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Fraser Government with Howard as Treasurer lost the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]] to the Labor Party led by [[Bob Hawke]]. Over the course of the 1980s, the Liberal party came to accept the free-market policies that Fraser had resisted and Howard had espoused. Policies included low protection, decentralisation of wage fixation, financial deregulation, a broadly based indirect tax, and the rejection of counter-cyclical fiscal policy.{{sfnp|Kelly|1994|p=232}}\n\n==Opposition, 1983\u20131996==\nFollowing the defeat of the Fraser government and Fraser's subsequent resignation from parliament, Howard contested the Liberal leadership against [[Andrew Peacock]], [[1983 Liberal Party of Australia leadership election|losing 36\u201320]]. However, he was re-elected as deputy leader. The Liberal Party were again defeated by Labor at the early [[1984 Australian federal election|1984 election]]. In 1985, as Labor's position in opinion polls improved, Peacock's popularity sank and Howard's profile rose. Leadership speculation persisted, and Peacock said he would no longer accept Howard as deputy unless he offered assurances that he would not challenge for the leadership.

Howard was not helped when the federal Nationals broke off the Coalition agreement in support of the \"Joh for Canberra\" push. Bjelke-Petersen abandoned his bid for prime minister a month before the election. However, the damage had already been done. The end of the Coalition agreement led to a large number of three-cornered contests. Additionally, a number of swing voters outside Queensland were alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, and voted for Labor in order to ensure that the Liberals and Nationals would be defeated.
