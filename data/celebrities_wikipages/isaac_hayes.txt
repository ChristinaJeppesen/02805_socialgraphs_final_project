He was one of the creative forces behind the [[Southern soul]] music label [[Stax Records]], where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a session musician and record producer, teaming with his partner [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]] during the mid-1960s. Hayes and Porter were inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of songs for themselves, the duo [[Sam & Dave]], [[Carla Thomas]], and others.

It was also honored by [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], by ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, and by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) as one of the [[Songs of the Century]]. During the late 1960s, Hayes also began a career as a recording artist. He had several successful soul albums such as ''[[Hot Buttered Soul]]'' (1969) and ''[[Black Moses (album)|Black Moses]]'' (1971). In addition to his work in [[popular music]], he worked as a [[film score composer|composer of musical scores]] for motion pictures.\n\nHayes was known for his musical score for the film ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' (1971). For the \"[[Theme from Shaft|Theme from ''Shaft'']]\", he was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1972. This made him the third black person, after [[Hattie McDaniel]] and [[Sidney Poitier]], to win an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in any competitive field covered by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. Hayes also won two [[Grammy Award]]s for that same year. Later, he was given his third Grammy for his music album ''Black Moses''.\n\nIn 1992, Hayes was crowned honorary king of the [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] region of Ghana in recognition of his humanitarian work there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://face2faceafrica.com/article/celebrating-isaac-hayes-the-philanthropic-musician-who-was-crowned-king-in-ghana|title=Celebrating Isaac Hayes, the philanthropic musician who was crowned king in Ghana|date=August 10, 2018|website=Face2faceafrica.com|access-date=February 23, 2021}}</ref> He acted in motion pictures and television, such as in the movies ''[[Truck Turner]]'' and ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', and as Gandolf \"Gandy\" Fitch in the TV series ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' (1974\u20131980).

After graduating from high school, Hayes was offered several music scholarships from colleges and universities.

One of the first Stax records he played on was \"Winter Snow\" by Booker T. and The M.G.s (Stax 45-236), which indicates \"Introducing Issac Hayes on piano\" on the label.\n\nHayes-Porter contributed to the Stax sound of this period, and Sam & Dave credited Hayes for helping develop both their sound and style. In 1968, Hayes released his debut album, ''[[Presenting Isaac Hayes]]'', a jazzy, largely improvised effort that was commercially unsuccessful.<ref name=\"contact\">\"[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/isaachayesx18x10x05 Ultimate Isaac Hayes (Can You Dig It?), Audio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606114233/http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/webpages/isaachayesx18x10x05 |date=June 6, 2011 }}\".

Its biggest star, [[Otis Redding]], had died in a plane crash in 1967. Stax lost its back catalog to [[Atlantic Records]] in May 1968. As a result, Stax executive vice president [[Al Bell]] called for 27 new albums to be completed in mid-1969; ''Hot Buttered Soul'' was the most successful of these releases.<ref name=\"contact\"/>\n\n''Hot Buttered Soul'' featured Hayes's image (shaved head, gold jewelry, sunglasses) alongside his sound (extended orchestral songs relying heavily on organs, horns and guitars, and deep bass vocals). On the album, Hayes reinterpreted \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" (previously recorded by Dionne Warwick) into a 12-minute exploration. \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\" starts with an eight-minute-long monologue<ref>{{cite web|url=http://perthetic.wordpress.com/2008/08/12/rip-isaac-hayes|title=RIP Isaac Hayes|publisher=Perthetic.wordpress.com|date=August 12, 2008|access-date=September 11, 2010}}</ref> before breaking into song, and the lone original number, the funky \"Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic\" runs nearly ten minutes, a significant break from the standard three-minute soul/pop songs. \"Walk On By\" would be the first of many times Hayes would take a [[Burt Bacharach]] standard, generally known as three-minute pop songs by Dionne Warwick or [[Dusty Springfield]], and transform it into a soulful, lengthy and almost [[gospel music|gospel]] number.\n\nIn 1970, Hayes released two albums, ''[[The Isaac Hayes Movement]]'' and ''[[...To Be Continued (Isaac Hayes album)|...To Be Continued]]''. The former stuck to the four-song template of his previous album. [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler's]] \"I Stand Accused\" begins with a trademark spoken word monologue, and Bacharach's \"[[I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself]]\" is re-worked.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The latter album included \"[[The Look of Love (1967 song)#Notable cover versions|The Look of Love]]\", another Bacharach song transformed into an 11-minute epic of lush orchestral rhythm (mid-way it breaks into a rhythm guitar jam for a couple of minutes before suddenly resuming the slow love song). An edited three-minute version was issued as a single.<ref name=\"discography\"/> The album featured the instrumental \"Ike's Mood,\" which segues into a version of \"[[You've Lost That Loving Feeling]]\". Hayes released a Christmas single, \"The Mistletoe and Me\" (with \"Winter Snow\" as a [[B-side]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn early 1971, Hayes composed music for the [[Shaft (Isaac Hayes album)|soundtrack]] of the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Shaft (1971 film)|Shaft]]'' (he appeared in a cameo role as a bartender). The title theme, with its [[Wah-wah pedal|wah-wah guitar]] and multi-layered [[symphonic]] arrangement, would become a worldwide hit single, and spent two weeks at number one in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in November. The remainder of the album was mostly instrumentals covering big beat jazz, bluesy funk, and hard Stax-styled soul. The other two vocal songs, the [[social commentary]] \"Soulsville\" and the 19-minute jam \"Do Your Thing,\" would be edited down to hit singles.<ref name=\"discography\">[http://staxrecords.free.fr/hayes.htm Isaac Hayes Discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150804084753/http://staxrecords.free.fr/hayes.htm|date=August 4, 2015}}, staxrecords.free.fr; retrieved March 15, 2008.</ref> He won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for the [[Theme from Shaft|\"Theme from ''Shaft'']]\", and in addition was nominated for Best Original Dramatic Score.

''Tough Guys'' was almost devoid of vocals and ''Truck Turner'' yielded a single with the title theme. The soundtrack score of ''Truck Turner'' was eventually used by filmmaker [[Quentin Tarantino]] in the ''[[Kill Bill]]'' film series, and has been used for over 30 years as the opening score of Brazilian radio show ''Jornal de Esportes'' on the [[Jovem Pan]] station.\n\nUnlike most African American musicians of the period, Hayes did not sport an [[Afro]] haircut; his bald head became one of his defining characteristics.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===1974\u20131977: HBS, basketball team ownership, and bankruptcy===\nBy 1974, Stax Records was having serious financial problems, stemming from problems with overextension and limited record sales and distribution.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Hayes himself was deep in debt to [[Union Planters|Union Planters Bank]], which administered loans for the Stax label and many of its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for $5.3&nbsp;million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes's income and apply it towards his debts.\n\nHayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through [[ABC Records]].{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=332\u2013334}} His new album, 1975's ''Chocolate Chip'', saw Hayes embrace the disco sound with the title track and lead single. \"I Can't Turn Around\" would prove a popular song as time went on. This would be Hayes's last album to chart in the top 40 for many years. Later in the year, the all-instrumental ''Disco Connection'' album fully embraced disco.\n\nOn July 17, 1974, Hayes, along with [[Mike Storen]], [[Avron Fogelman]] and [[Kemmons Wilson]], took over ownership of the [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|American Basketball Association]] team the [[Memphis Tams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/memphis-sounds.html|access-date=July 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210603044610/http://www.remembertheaba.com/memphis-sounds.html |archive-date=June 3, 2021|url-status=live|title=Memphis Sounds|website=Remember the ABA}}</ref> The prior owner was [[Charles O.

The group was given a deadline of June 1, 1975, to sell 4,000 season tickets, obtain new investors and arrange a more favorable lease for the team at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]]. However, the group did not come through and the ABA took over the team, selling it to a group in Maryland that renamed the team the [[Baltimore Hustlers]] and then the [[Baltimore Claws]] before the club finally folded during preseason play for the 1975\u20131976 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Memphis-Sounds.html |title=Memphis Sounds |publisher=Remember the ABA |access-date=September 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019043125/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Memphis-Sounds.html |archive-date=October 19, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the album cover of ''Juicy Fruit'' featured Hayes in a pool with naked women, and spawned the title track single and the classic \"Storm Is Over\". Later the same year the ''Groove-A-Thon'' album featured the singles \"Rock Me Easy Baby\" and the title track. However, while all these albums were regarded as solid efforts, Hayes was no longer selling large numbers. He and his wife were forced into bankruptcy in 1976, as they owed over $6&nbsp;million. By the end of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1977, Hayes had lost his home, much of his personal property, and the rights to all future royalties earned from the music he had written, performed, and produced.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=334}}\n\n===1977\u20131995: Polydor, hiatus, and film work===\nIn 1977, Hayes was back with a new deal with Polydor Records, a live album of duets with [[Dionne Warwick]] did moderately well, and his comeback studio album ''New Horizon'' sold better and enjoyed a hit single \"Out The Ghetto\", and also featured the popular \"It's Heaven To Me\". 1978's ''For the Sake of Love'' saw Hayes record a sequel to \"Theme from ''Shaft''\" (\"Shaft II\"), but was best known for the single \"Zeke The Freak\", a song that would have a shelf life of decades and be a major part of the [[House music|House]] movement in the UK. The same year, [[Fantasy Records]], which had bought out Stax Records, released an album of Hayes's non-album singles and archived recordings as a \"new\" album, ''Hotbed'', in 1978. In 1979, Hayes returned to the Top 40 with ''Don't Let Go'' and its disco-styled title track that became a hit single (U.S. #18), and also featured the classic \"A Few More Kisses To Go\". Later in the year he added vocals and worked on [[Millie Jackson]]'s album ''Royal Rappin's'', and a song he co-wrote, \"[[Deja Vu (Dionne Warwick song)|Deja Vu]]\", became a hit for Dionne Warwick and won her a Grammy for best female R&B vocal. Neither 1980s ''And Once Again'' or 1981's ''Lifetime Thing'' produced notable songs or big sales, and Hayes chose to take a break from music to pursue acting.\n\nIn the 1970s, Hayes was featured in the films ''Shaft'' (1971) and ''[[Truck Turner]]'' (1974); he also had a recurring role in the TV series ''[[The Rockford Files]]'' as an old cellmate of Rockford's, Gandolph Fitch (who always referred to Rockford as \"Rockfish\" much to his annoyance), including one episode alongside duet-partner Dionne Warwick. In the 1980s and 1990s, he appeared in numerous films, notably ''[[Escape from New York]]'' (1981), ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'' (1988), ''Prime Target'' (1991), and ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]'' (1993), as well as in episodes of ''[[The A-Team]]'' and ''[[Miami Vice]]''. He also attempted a musical comeback, embracing the style of drum machines and synth for 1986s ''U-Turn'' and 1988s ''Love Attack'', though neither proved successful. In 1991, he was featured in a duet with fellow soul singer [[Barry White]] on White's ballad \"Dark and Lovely (You Over There)\".\n\n===1995\u20132006: Return to prominence and ''South Park''===\n\nIn 1995, Hayes appeared as a Las Vegas minister impersonating himself in the comedy series ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''.

The role of Chef combined his work both as an actor and as a singer, thanks to the character's penchant for making conversational points in the form of crudely suggestive soul songs. A song from the series performed by Chef, \"[[Chocolate Salty Balls|Chocolate Salty Balls (P.S. I Love You)]]\", received international radio airplay in 1999.
