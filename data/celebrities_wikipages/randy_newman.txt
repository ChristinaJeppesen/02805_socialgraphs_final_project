In 1968, he made his formal debut as a solo artist with the album ''[[Randy Newman (album)|Randy Newman]]'', produced by [[Lenny Waronker]] and [[Van Dyke Parks]]. Four of Newman's non-soundtrack albums have charted in the US top 40: ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' (1972), ''[[Good Old Boys (Randy Newman album)|Good Old Boys]]'' (1974), ''[[Little Criminals]]'' (1977), and ''[[Harps and Angels]]'' (2008).\n\nSince the 1980s, Newman has worked mostly as a film composer. He has scored nine [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]-[[Pixar]] animated films, including all four ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films (1995\u20132019), ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998), both ''[[Monsters, Inc.

His other film scores include ''[[Cold Turkey (1971 film)|Cold Turkey]]'' (1971), ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'' (1981), ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984), ''[[Awakenings]]'' (1990), ''[[Pleasantville (film)|''Pleasantville'']]'' (1998), ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' (2000), ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'' (2003), and ''[[Marriage Story]]'' (2019).\n\nNewman has received twenty-two [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] categories and has won twice in the latter category, contributing to the Newmans being the [[List of Academy Award-winning families#Extended family|most nominated Academy Award extended family]], with a collective 92 nominations in various music categories.

His work as a songwriter met with particular success in the UK: top 40 UK hits written by Newman included [[Cilla Black]]'s \"I've Been Wrong Before\" (No. 17, 1965), Gene Pitney's \"Nobody Needs Your Love\" (No. 2, 1966) and \"[[Just One Smile]]\" (No. 8, 1966); and [[the Alan Price Set]]'s \"[[Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear]]\" (No. 4, 1967). Price, an English keyboardist who was enjoying great success at the time, championed Newman by featuring seven Randy Newman songs on his 1967 ''A Price on His Head'' album.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Newman kept a close musical relationship with the band [[Harpers Bizarre]], best known for their 1967 hit version of the [[Paul Simon]] composition \"[[The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)]]\". The band recorded six Newman compositions, including \"Simon Smith\" and \"Happyland,\" during their short initial career (1967\u20131969).\n\nIn this period, Newman began a long professional association with childhood friend [[Lenny Waronker]]. Waronker had been hired to produce the Tikis, [[the Beau Brummels]] and [[the Mojo Men]], who were all contracted to the Los Angeles independent label [[Autumn Records]]. He in turn brought in Newman, [[Leon Russell]] and another friend, pianist/arranger [[Van Dyke Parks]], to play on recording sessions. Later in 1966, Waronker was hired as an A&R manager by [[Warner Bros. Records]] and his friendship with Newman, Russell and Parks began a creative circle around Waronker at Warner Bros. that became one of the keys to Warner Bros.' subsequent success as a rock music label.<ref>Fred Goodman, ''The Mansion on the Hill: Dylan, Young, Geffen, Springsteen and the Head-on Collision of Rock and Commerce'' ([[Random House]], 1997), p.65</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Newman co-wrote with [[Jake Holmes]] the \"Most Original Soft Drink Ever\" jingle for [[Dr Pepper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicthemes.com/50sTVThemes/sheetMusicBooks/jingleFolioBooks.html |title=Advertising Jingle Music Folio Books |website=Classicthemes.com |date=April 24, 2003 |access-date=February 26, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Newman endorsed jazz singer [[Roseanna Vitro]]'s album, ''The Randy Newman Project'' ([[Mot\u00e9ma Music]], 2011).<ref>{{cite web|author=All About Jazz|author-link=All About Jazz|url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=40042&page=1 |title=Roseanna Vitro: Following Her Muse |website=Allaboutjazz.com |access-date=September 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, Newman wrote a song called \u201cStay Away\u201d to support people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The album was not a commercial success, but critics liked it (it won a \"Record of the Year\" award from ''[[Stereo Review]]'' magazine), and it paved the way for Newman's 1970 release, ''[[12 Songs (Randy Newman album)|12 Songs]]'', a more stripped-down sound that showcased Newman's piano. [[Ry Cooder]]'s slide guitar and contributions from [[Byrds]] members [[Gene Parsons]] and [[Clarence White]] helped to give the album a much rootsier feel. ''12 Songs'' was also critically acclaimed (6th best album of the seventies according to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Robert Christgau]]), but again found little commercial success, though [[Three Dog Night]] made a huge hit of his \"[[Mama Told Me Not to Come]]\". The following year, ''[[Randy Newman Live]]'' cemented his cult following and became his first LP to appear in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, at No. 191. Newman also made his first foray into music for films at this time, writing and performing the theme song \"[[He Gives Us All His Love]]\" for [[Norman Lear]]'s 1971 film ''[[Cold Turkey (1971 film)|Cold Turkey]].''\n\n1972's [[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|''Sail Away'']] reached No. 163 on ''Billboard'', with the title track making its way into the repertoire of [[Ray Charles]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]. \"[[You Can Leave Your Hat On]]\" which was covered by [[Three Dog Night]], then [[Joe Cocker]], and later by [[Keb Mo]], [[Etta James]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] (whose version was later used for the final striptease to the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]''), and the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois singer [[Garou (singer)#Live albums|Garou]]. The album also featured \"Burn On\", an ode to an infamous incident in which the heavily polluted [[Cuyahoga River]] literally caught fire. In 1989, \"Burn On\" was used as the opening theme to the film ''[[Major League (film)|Major League]]'', whose focus was the hapless [[Cleveland Indians]].\n[[File:Randy Newman (muzikant, opdracht Haagse Courant), Bestanddeelnr 927-2100.jpg|left|thumb|Newman in 1974]]\nHis 1974 release ''[[Good Old Boys (Randy Newman album)|Good Old Boys]]'' was a set of songs about the American South. \"[[Rednecks (song)|Rednecks]]\" began with a description of segregationist [[Lester Maddox]] pitted against a \"smart-ass New York Jew\" on a TV show (this was a joke, because the \"Jew\" was Dick Cavett), in a song that criticizes both [[Racism in the United States|southern racism]] and the complacent bigotry of Americans outside of the south who stereotype all southerners as racist yet ignore racism in northern and midwestern states and large cities. This ambiguity was also apparent on \"Kingfish\" and \"[[Every Man a King]]\", the former a [[paean]] to [[Huey Long]] (the assassinated former Governor and [[United States Senator]] from [[Louisiana]]), the other a campaign song written by Long himself. An album that received lavish critical praise, ''Good Old Boys'' also became a commercial breakthrough for Newman, peaking at No. 36 on ''Billboard'' 200, spending 21 weeks there.\n\n''[[Little Criminals]]'' (1977) contained the surprise hit \"[[Short People]]\", which also became a subject of controversy. In September 1977, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported the following interview with Newman talking about his then-new release. \"There's one song about a child murderer,\" Newman deadpans. \"That's fairly optimistic. Maybe. There's one called 'Jolly Coppers on Parade' which isn't an absolutely anti-police song. Maybe it's even a fascist song. I didn't notice at the time. There's also one about me as a cowboy called 'Rider in the Rain.' I think it's ridiculous. [[The Eagles]] are on there. That's what's good about it. There's also this song 'Short People.' It's purely a joke.

Another somewhat controversial Randy Newman number, recorded by both [[Harpers Bizarre]] and [[The Nashville Teens]], was \"The Biggest Night of Her Life\", a song about a schoolgirl who is \"too excited to sleep\" because she has promised to lose her virginity on her sixteenth birthday to a boy whom her parents like \"because his hair is always neat\".\n\n1979's ''Born Again'' featured a song satirically mythologizing the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (and their arranging style) titled \"The Story of a Rock and Roll Band\".\n\nHis 1983 album ''[[Trouble in Paradise (Randy Newman album)|Trouble in Paradise]]'' included the single \"[[I Love L.A.]]\", a song that has been interpreted as both praising and criticizing the city of Los Angeles. This ambivalence is borne out by Newman's own comments on the song. As he explained in a 2001 interview, \"There's some kind of ignorance L.A. has that I'm proud of. The open car and the redhead, the [[Beach Boys]]&nbsp;... I can't think of anything a hell of a lot better than that.\" The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC network]] and [[Frank Gari|Frank Gari Productions]] transformed \"I Love L.A.\" into a popular 1980s TV promotional campaign, retooling the lyrics and title to \"You'll Love It!\" (on ABC) The song is played at home games for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] as well as the [[Los Angeles Kings]] who use the song along with their [[goal horn]]. In spite of its prominence, however, it failed to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nIn 1985 Newman performed a set at the first [[Farm Aid]] concert that included a duet with [[Billy Joel]] on facing grand pianos. Newman performed \"[[Sail Away (Randy Newman song)|Sail Away]]\".\n\nIn 2003 Newman's song \"[[It's a Jungle Out There (song)|It's a Jungle Out There]]\" was used for season 2 of the USA Network's show [[Monk (TV Series)|''Monk'']]; it won him the 2004 [[Emmy Award]] for Best Main Title Music.\n\nIn the years following ''Trouble in Paradise'', Newman focused more on film work, but his personal life entered a difficult period. He separated from his wife of nearly 20 years, Roswitha. He released four albums of new material as a singer-songwriter since that time: ''[[Land of Dreams (Randy Newman album)|Land of Dreams]]'' (1988), ''[[Bad Love (Randy Newman album)|Bad Love]]'' (1999), ''[[Harps and Angels]]'' (2008), and [[Dark Matter (Randy Newman album)|''Dark Matter'']] (2017). ''Land of Dreams'' included one of his best-known songs, \"It's Money That Matters\", and featured Newman's first stab at autobiography with \"Dixie Flyer\" and \"Four Eyes\", while ''Bad Love'' included \"I Miss You\", a moving tribute to his ex-wife<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&q=newman+i+miss+you+ex+wife&pg=PA298 |title=Randy Newman's American Dreams |author=Kevin Courrier |page=298 |year=2005 |isbn=9781550226904 |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref> (In an interview with [[Glenn Tilbrook]], half of the writing partnership of English pop band [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], to promote the album, probably on [[BBC Radio]], Newman acknowledged that \"I Miss You\" was written for his ex-wife. When asked by Tilbrook how his current wife felt about this, Newman said that though he had always been obedient to his wives in most things there was one area in which he did as he chose; \"I write what I write\", he said.){{citation needed|date=May 2020}} He has also rerecorded a number of songs that span his career, accompanying himself on piano, with ''The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 1 (2003)'', ''The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 2 (2011)'' and ''The Randy Newman Songbook Vol. 3 (2016)''. He continues to perform his songs before live audiences as a touring concert artist.\n[[File:Randy Newman, 2014.jpg|alt=Newman sitting at a piano|thumb|Newman performing at the 2014 [[Laurence L. & Thomas Winship/PEN New England Award]] for Songwriting ceremony]]\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, Newman's \"[[Louisiana 1927]]\" became an anthem and was played heavily on a wide range of American radio and television stations, in both Newman's 1974 original and [[Aaron Neville]]'s cover version of the song. The song addresses the deceitful manner in which [[New Orleans]]'s municipal government managed a [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|flood in 1927]], during which, as Newman asserts, \"The guys who ran the [[Mardi Gras]], the bosses in New Orleans decided the course of that flood.

Retrieved on July 13, 2012.</ref> In a related performance, Newman contributed to the 2007 release of ''[[Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino]]'' ([[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]]), contributing his version of [[Fats Domino|Domino]]'s \"[[Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)|Blue Monday]]\". Domino had been rescued from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Katrina, initially having been feared dead.\n\nIn October 2016, Newman released the song \"Putin\". ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: \"inspired by [[Vladimir Putin|the Russian leader's]] penchant for bare-chested photo ops and a geopolitical approach that's somewhat short of soft and cuddly, Newman has crafted a song that tells Putin's story from multiple perspectives.\"<ref name =Putin/> Newman explained that the song was from a new album that would be released in 2017, but he was putting out this song early because \"I think that people will lose interest after this surfeit of political talk and attention after [[2016 United States presidential election|the election]].... I've got the thing done. I just want to see what happens. I'm curious to see how the thing is received.\"<ref name =Putin>{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2016/10/10/exclusive-listen-to-randy-newmans-first-new-song-in-four-years-its-about-bare-chested-vladimir-putin-really/| title = Randy Newman's first new song in years is about bare-chested Vladimir Putin| author = Edgers, Geoff| date = October 10, 2016| access-date = October 12, 2016| newspaper = The Washington Post}}</ref> The song earned Newman a [[Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/arts/music/grammy-winners.html|title=Grammy 2018 Winners: Full List|first=Andrew R.|last=Chow|date=January 28, 2018|access-date=March 5, 2019|website=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nNewman released his much anticipated new album, [[Dark Matter (Randy Newman album)|''Dark Matter'']] in August 2017. It received positive reviews, many citing its musical ambition as well as its lyrical bite.\n\n===Film composer===\nNewman's earliest scoring work was for television, creating background music for a 1962 episode of TV's ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', and later working briefly on the 1960s TV shows ''[[Lost in Space]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', and ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea]]'' and more extensively on ''[[Judd, for the Defense|Judd For The Defense]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBo8RQLpwtUC&pg=PA205  |title=Randy Newman's American Dreams |author=Kevin Courrier |page=205 |year=2005 |isbn=9781550226904 |access-date=August 29, 2016}}</ref>  In 1966, an album of Newman's ''Peyton Place'' music appeared, credited to The Randy Newman Orchestra. The music was not a score from any episode, but incidental library music designed to be heard in contexts where characters turned on a radio station, or were watching TV.  Newman claims to have been unaware of the album's existence at the time of release and does not include it in the official \"complete discography\" on his website. He also co-wrote the title song for the 1970 drama ''[[Cover Me Babe]]''. The recording was performed by [[Bread (band)|Bread]].\n\nNewman also co-wrote pop songs for films as early as 1964, co-penning \"Look At Me\" with [[Bobby Darin]] for ''[[The Lively Set]]'' (1964), and \"Galaxy-a-Go-Go, or Leave It To Flint\" with [[Jerry Goldsmith]] for ''[[Our Man Flint]]'' (1966). However, Newman's work as a composer of actual film scores began with [[Norman Lear]]'s 1971 satire ''[[Cold Turkey (1971 film)|Cold Turkey]]''. He returned to film work with 1981's ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'', for which he was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]]. Newman co-wrote the 1986 film ''[[Three Amigos]]'' with [[Steve Martin]] and [[Lorne Michaels]], wrote three songs for the film, and provided the voice for the singing bush. His orchestral film scores resemble the work of [[Elmer Bernstein]] (with whom he worked on ''Three Amigos'') and [[Maurice Jarre]].{{says who?|date=October 2022}}\n\nNewman has scored nine [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Pixar]] feature films; ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'', ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', ''[[Monsters University]]'', ''[[Cars 3]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 4]]''.<ref name=THRD23DoryTS4>{{cite news|last1=Giardina|first1=Carolyn|title=D23: Pixar Previews 'Finding Dory' and 'Toy Story 4'|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/d23-pixar-previews-finding-dory-815593|access-date=August 15, 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 14, 2015}}</ref> He has earned at least one Academy Award nomination for six of the nine films he has scored for Pixar, winning the award for ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' and ''[[Toy Story 3]]'', both times in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]]. Additional scores by Newman include ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'', ''[[Parenthood (1989 film)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'', ''[[Seabiscuit (film)|Seabiscuit]]'', ''[[Awakenings]]'', ''[[The Paper (film)|The Paper]]'', ''[[Meet the Parents]]'', and its sequel, ''[[Meet the Fockers]]''. His score for ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]'' was an [[Academy Award]] nominee. He also wrote the songs for Turner's ''[[Cats Don't Dance]]''.\n\nNewman had the dubious distinction of receiving the most [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations (15) without a single win. His losing streak was broken when he received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 2002, for the ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' song \"[[If I Didn't Have You (Disney song)|If I Didn't Have You]]\", beating [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Enya]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. After receiving a standing ovation, a bemused but emotional Newman began his acceptance speech with \"I don't want your pity!\" When the orchestra began playing the underscore signifying that the speaker's time on stage is concluding, Newman ordered them to stop before thanking \"all these musicians, many of whom have worked for me several times and may not again.\"\n\nBesides writing songs for films, he also writes songs for television series such as the Emmy Award-winning theme song of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', \"[[It's a Jungle Out There (song)|It's a Jungle Out There]]\". Newman also composed the Emmy Award-winning song \"When I'm Gone\" for the final episode.\n\nNewman wrote the music for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. During Disney's annual shareholder meeting in March 2007, Newman performed a new song written for the movie. He was accompanied by the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]. The New Orleans setting of the film played to Newman's musical strengths, and his songs contained elements of [[Cajun music]], [[zydeco]], [[blues]] and [[Dixieland|Dixieland jazz]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Newman mines Big Easy music for 'Frog'|magazine=Variety |url=https://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral&jump=features&id=Music_Preview&articleid=VR1118011431 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629173811/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=awardcentral&jump=features&id=Music_Preview&articleid=VR1118011431 |archive-date=June 29, 2011 | first=Jon | last=Burlingame | date=November 16, 2009}}</ref> Two of the songs, \"[[Almost There (The Princess and the Frog song)|Almost There]]\" and \"[[Down in New Orleans (song)|Down in New Orleans]]\", were nominated for Oscars.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Randy Newman, T Bone Burnett Earn Oscar Nominations |magazine=Billboard |date= February 2010 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959521/randy-newman-t-bone-burnett-earn-oscar-nominations}}</ref>\n\nIn total, Newman has received 22 Academy Award nominations with two wins, both for Best Original Song.

After a 1995 staging at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]], he retained [[David Mamet]] to help rework the book before its relaunch on the Chicago [[Goodman Theatre]] [[mainstage]] in 1996. Newman's Faust had a one-time performance at the City Center in New York City on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Devil Went to Midtown to Serenade the Lord: 'Randy Newman's Faust,' With the Composer on Hand |date=July 3, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/theater/randy-newmans-faust-with-the-composer-on-hand.html|website=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[South Coast Repertory]] (SCR) produced ''The Miseducation of Randy Newman'', a musical theater piece that recreates the life of a songwriter who bears some resemblance to the actual Newman. Set in [[New Orleans]] and Los Angeles, it was modeled on the American autobiography, ''[[The Education of Henry Adams]]''.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Center Theatre Group]] staged ''Harps and Angels'', a musical revue of the Randy Newman songbook, interspersed with narratives reflecting on Newman's inspirations. The revue premiered at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in Los Angeles and included among other songs \"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\", \"Sail Away\", \"Marie\", \"Louisiana 1927\", \"Feels Like Home\", \"[[You've Got a Friend in Me]]\" and \"I Love L.A\". The revue was directed by [[Jerry Zaks]] and featured Ryder Bach, [[Storm Large]], [[Adriane Lenox]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Katey Sagal]] and Matthew Saldivar.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=World Premiere of Randy Newman's Harps and Angels Opens Nov. 21 |magazine=Playbill |date=November 21, 2010 |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/145128-World-Premiere-of-Randy-Newmans-Harps-and-Angels-Opens-Nov-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104165652/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/145128-World-Premiere-of-Randy-Newmans-Harps-and-Angels-Opens-Nov-21 |archive-date=January 4, 2011  }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nNewman was married to German-born Roswitha Schmale from 1967 to 1985, and they had three sons,<ref>{{cite web|last=Lubow |first=Arthur |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20084887,00.html |title=Randy Newman |website=People |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> [[Eric Newman (producer)|Eric Newman]], Amos Newman and John Newman.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Kamp|first=David|title=How Randy Newman and His Family Have Shaped Movie Music for Generations|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/02/randy-newman-musical-family|access-date=July 24, 2020|magazine=Vanity Fair|date=February 18, 2016|issue=Hollywood|language=en-us}}</ref> He has been married to Gretchen Preece since 1990, with whom he has two children, Patrick Newman and Alice Newman.
