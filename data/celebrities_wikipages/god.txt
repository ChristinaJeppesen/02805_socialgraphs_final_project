The reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] form {{PIE|* \u01f5hu-t\u00f3-m}} was likely based on the root {{PIE|* \u01f5hau(\u0259)-}}, which meant either \"to call\" or \"to invoke\".<ref>The ulterior etymology is disputed. Apart from the unlikely hypothesis of adoption from a foreign tongue, the OTeut. \"ghuba\" implies as its preTeut-type either \"*ghodho-m\" or \"*ghodto-m\". The former does not appear to admit of explanation; but the latter would represent the neut. pple. of a root \"gheu-\". There are two Aryan roots of the required form (\"*g,heu-\" with palatal aspirate) one with meaning 'to invoke' (Skr. \"hu\") the other 'to pour, to offer sacrifice' (Skr \"hu\", Gr. \u03c7\u03b5\u03b7i;\u03bd, OE \"geot\u00e0n\" Yete v).

Briefly in the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[quinque viae]]}}\n# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\n# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.\n# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\n# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. This then, we call God (Note: Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself).\n# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. This we call God (Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view, the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well).<ref>Summa of Theology I, q. 2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence</ref>\n\n===Personal===\nGod or deities from [[Near East|Near Eastern cultures]] are often thought of as [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] entities who have a human like body which is, however, not equal to a human body.

The term has been used to describe certain strands of Buddhism, <ref>Antonio Rigopoulos, The Life and Teachings of Sai Baba of Shirdi (1993), p. 372; J. L. (Ed) Houlden, Jesus: The Complete Guide (2005), p. 390</ref> Jainism and [[Stoicism]].<ref>''Writings on Religion'', Walter de Gruyter (1988), p. 145.</ref>\n\nAmong religions that do attach spirituality to the relationship with God disagree as how to best [[worship]] God and what is [[divine providence|God's plan]] for mankind. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the [[chosen people]] or have exclusive access to [[absolute truth]], generally through [[revelation]] or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is [[religious pluralism]]. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. The [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith]] preaches that [[Manifestation of God (Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith)|divine manifestation]]s include great prophets and teachers of many of the major religious traditions such as Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, Zoroaster, Muhammad, Bah\u00e1'\u00fa'll\u00e1h and also preaches the unity of all religions and focuses on these multiple epiphanies as necessary for meeting the needs of humanity at different points in history and for different cultures, and as part of a scheme of [[Progressive revelation (Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed)|progressive revelation]] and education of humanity. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is [[supersessionism]], i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is [[inclusivism|relativistic inclusivism]], where everybody is seen as equally right; an example being [[universalism]]: the doctrine that [[salvation]] is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is [[syncretic|syncretism]], mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the [[New Age]] movement.\n\n==Epistemology==\n===Faith===\n{{Main|Faith}}\nAs opposed to the [[evidentialist]] position taken by those such as [[Richard Swinburne]], [[faith]] in God is also sometimes held to be \"[[reformed epistemology|properly basic]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Michael |last=Beaty |year=1991 |title=God Among the Philosophers |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=53 |journal=The Christian Century |access-date=20 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109162529/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=53 |archive-date=9 January 2007}}</ref> Some theists agree that only some of the arguments for God's existence are compelling, but argue that faith is not a product of [[reason]], but requires risk.

This practice ended during the beginning of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. Zoroastrian [[iconoclasm]], which can be traced to the end of the Parthian period and the beginning of the Sassanid, eventually put an end to the use of all images of Ahura Mazda in worship.

Judaism is [[aniconism|aniconic]], meaning it overly lacks material, physical representations of both the natural and supernatural worlds. Furthermore, the worship of idols is strictly forbidden. The traditional view, elaborated by figures such as [[Maimonides]], reckons that God is wholly incomprehensible and therefore impossible to envision, resulting in a historical tradition of \"divine incorporeality\".

Some, like the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], are depiction borrowed from Jewish art. Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to use a human to symbolize [[God the Father]] in [[Western art]].<ref name=\"James Cornwell page 24\" /> Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for symbolizing the Father using a man gradually emerged around the 10th century AD. A rationale for the use of a human is the belief that God created the soul of man in the image of his own (thus allowing human to transcend the other animals). It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a usage of the whole human figure. Typically only a small part would be used as the image, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely a whole human. In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.<ref name=\"Adolphe Napol\u00e9on Didron pages 169\">Adolphe Napol\u00e9on Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} p. 169</ref> By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French [[illuminated manuscript]]s, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in [[stained glass]] church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] on the famous [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge|baptismal font in Li\u00e8ge]] of [[Rainer of Huy]] is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene).

The [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Lorenzo Ghiberti|\"Gates of Paradise\" of the Florence Baptistry]] by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], begun in 1425 use a similar tall full-length symbol for the Father. The [[Rohan Book of Hours]] of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer. At the same period other works, like the large Genesis [[altarpiece]] by the Hamburg painter [[Meister Bertram]], continued to use the old depiction of Christ as ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'' in Genesis scenes. In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ]].
