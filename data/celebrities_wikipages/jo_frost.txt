''[[Family S.O.S. with Jo Frost]]'' addressed issues such as addiction and abuse. ''Family Matters'' is a [[talk show]]. She has written six books on [[child care]].\n\n==Early life==\nFrost grew up with one brother{{r|Getting the Most}} in [[South West (London sub region)|Southwest London]].{{r|Oprah approved}}{{r|Head on}} Her father was an English builder and her mother, born in [[Gibraltar]], was an interior decorator. Frost had a happy, physically active childhood. Because her father was interested in history, she frequently visited a number of castles and museums as a child. Frost's mother died of [[breast cancer]]<ref>{{cite web|title=6Yr Old Boy Has Lost All Memories Of Mom - Supernanny|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZstxFZcILQ|access-date=15 October 2022}}</ref> when Frost was 24.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mihalik Family - Season 3 Episode 5 - Full Episodes - Supernanny USA|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w93dxfDVkc|access-date=15 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Nanny===\nFrost worked as a nanny for over 30 years, beginning in 1989, when she was 18 years of age.{{r|Oprah approved}}{{r|Came to tea}} She was employed in the United Kingdom and the United States{{r|New show}} and Frost's clients included celebrities such as [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]], a television producer.{{r|Oprah approved}}\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Jofrost2.jpg|thumb|Frost filming at the [[Children's Museum in Easton]], Massachusetts, U.S. in 2009]]\nFrost was hired for the Channel 4's{{r|Oprah approved}} ''[[Supernanny]]'' television show that launched in the United Kingdom in 2004. In each episode she visited a family and implemented consistent disciplinary, behavioral, and entertainment techniques to improve troubled families' lives.{{r|Oprah approved}} In their book ''Handbook of Psychological Assessment, Case Conceptualization, and Treatment, Children and Adolescents'', Michel Hersen and David Reitman state, \"With considerable skill, ''Super Nanny'' Jo Frost implements standard, evidence-based contingency management procedures, as well as heavy evidence of creating alternative positive activity structures.\"{{r|Hersen}} The show has had its critics, and not all child-care experts agree with her approach.{{r|Oprah approved}}{{r|Came to tea}} Some people find that the children's right to privacy has been violated{{r|Six childcare}} and that children are embarrassed when put on the \"naughty step\".{{r|Nanny state}} [[Newcastle University]] media and cultural-studies lecturer Tracey Jensen believes that the format results in the mother being \"shamed before she is transformed\".{{r|Six childcare}}\n\nThe show, viewed by six million people in its first year, was an \"instant success.\" Shows were created in 48 countries by 2014 that were tailored after ''Supernanny''.{{r|Oprah approved}}{{r|Came to tea}} The UK show ran six seasons.{{r|UK SN archives}} The United States version aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].{{r|Getting the Most}} Like the UK version, the American [[Supernanny (American TV series)|Supernanny]] was also a success and garnered Frost invitations to ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', and ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.{{r|Oprah approved}} In 2011, Frost quit ''Supernanny'', and Deborah Tillman, who ran a group of play schools, was hired as her replacement for the United States show.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n''Jo Frost: Extreme Parental Guidance'' aired in the UK for Channel 4 beginning in 2010.{{r|EPG 2010}} It had an issue-based format, with limited home visits.{{r|EPG Jul 2011}} ''[[Family S.O.S. with Jo Frost]]'' premiered 28 May 2013, on [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] in the United States with a 90-minute episode. ''Supernanny'' focused on discipline issues, but ''Family S.O.S.'' tackled serious, complex issues, such as blended families, addiction, abuse, and marital problems in family's homes.{{r|SOS May 2013}} TV critic Hank Stuever commented, \"For all its noise and uncomfy moments, ''Family S.O.S.'' is relatively genuine stuff, especially for the current incarnation of TLC. Viewers who know Frost's previous work will have no trouble believing that she cares about the outcome and sincerely wants to help these families patch things up.\"{{r|SOS May 2013}} Frost was one of the executive producers for the show.{{r|SOS Producer}}\n\nBeginning 18 April 2014, she hosted the talk show ''[[Jo Frost: Family Matters|Family Matters]]'' for [[ITV Network|ITV]]. Prior to the show, families underwent taped interviews about the nature of their difficulties, to be addressed during the talk show.{{r|FM}} The show relied on Frost's intuition and experience to resolve difficult situations, sometimes dealing with parents more directly than she may have done in other shows.{{r|Head on}} Over time, Frost has softened her image, including stopping her common gesture of pointing her finger at people, and stopped wearing severe suits, both of which had been iconic during her time on ''Supernanny''.{{cn|date=March 2021}} [[Twofour|Twofour Broadcast]] planned in July 2014 for a new UK show with Frost that would \"help to restore harmony and balance to their family life\" over the course of a family retreat.{{r|New show}}\n\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Frost's production company, Nanny Jo Productions, partnered with Strix Television to produce ''Nanny on Tour''.
