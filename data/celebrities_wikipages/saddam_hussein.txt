Second, the comparison with Stalin or Hitler is weak when one takes into consideration how many Iraqis were allowed to leave the country. Although citizens needed to undergo a convoluted and bureaucratic procedure to obtain the necessary papers to leave the country, the fact remains that more than one million Iraqis migrated from Iraq from the end of the Iran\u2013Iraq War in 1988 until the US-led invasion in 2003. Third, religion under Stalin did not function in the same manner as it did in Iraq, and while Faust details how the Shia were not allowed to engage in some of their ceremonies, the average Iraqi was allowed to pray at home and in a mosque.&nbsp;... it is correct that the security services kept a watch on religious establishments and mosques, but the Iraqi approach is somewhat different from that pursued by Stalin's totalitarianism.}}</ref> Saddam's rule was marked by [[Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq|numerous human rights abuses]], including [[Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq#Number of victims|an estimated 250,000 arbitrary killings]]<ref name=\"250k\" /> and bloody invasions of neighboring [[Iraqi invasion of Iran|Iran]] and [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait|Kuwait]].<ref>{{cite web|author-link=John Fisher Burns|last=Burns|first=John F.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/26/weekinreview/the-world-how-many-people-has-hussein-killed.html|title=How Many People Has Hussein Killed?|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 January 2003|access-date=20 February 2022|quote=The largest number of deaths attributable to Mr. Hussein's regime resulted from the war between Iraq and Iran between 1980 and 1988, which was launched by Mr. Hussein.

According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability.

[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/12/29/hussein.obit/index.html]</ref> At this time, Saddam moved up the ranks in the new government by aiding attempts to strengthen and unify the Ba'ath party and taking a leading role in addressing the country's major domestic problems and expanding the party's following.\n\nAfter the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]], Arab versus [[Kurds|Kurd]], tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 78\">Humphreys, 78</ref> The desire for stable rule in a country rife with [[Political faction|factionalism]] led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 78\" />\n\nSaddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.\n\nAt the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the [[1973 energy crisis]], and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda.\n[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|left|Saddam talking to [[Michel Aflaq]], the founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]], in 1988]]\nWithin just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the \"National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy\" and the campaign for \"Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,\" and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news2/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html Saddam Hussein], CBC News, 29 December 2006</ref><ref>Jessica Moore, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030625145156/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html The Iraq War player profile: Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power], PBS Online Newshour {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115205745/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html |date=15 November 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWith the help of increasing oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based [[economy of Iraq|Iraqi economy]]. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.\n\nThe oil revenue benefited Saddam politically.<ref name=\"economist2007\">{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8492668 | title=Saddam Hussein&nbsp;\u2013 The blundering dictator |date=4 January 2007 |newspaper=[[The Economist]]}}</ref> According to ''[[The Economist]]'', \"Much as Adolf Hitler won early praise for galvanizing German industry, ending mass unemployment and building autobahns, Saddam earned admiration abroad for his deeds.

As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally. He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations. He was the ''de facto'' leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979. He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.\n\nIn 1979, al-Bakr started to make treaties with Syria, also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to unification between the two countries. Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]] would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive Saddam to obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power. He forced the ailing al-Bakr to resign on 16 July 1979, and formally assumed the presidency.\n\n==== 1979 Ba'ath Party Purge ====\n{{Main|1979 Ba'ath Party Purge}}\nSaddam convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979.

After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty.

The Ba'ath Party, secular by nature, adopted Pan-Arab ideologies which in turn were problematic for significant parts of the population. Following the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, Iraq faced the prospect of r\u00e9gime change from two Shi'ite factions ([[Islamic Dawa Party|Dawa]] and [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq|SCIRI]]) which aspired to model Iraq on its neighbour Iran as a Shia theocracy. A separate threat to Iraq came from parts of the ethnic Kurdish population of [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] which opposed being part of an Iraqi state and favored independence (an ongoing ideology which had preceded Ba'ath Party rule). To alleviate the threat of revolution, Saddam afforded certain benefits to the potentially hostile population.

As the Ba'ath Party's paramilitary, the People's Army acted as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces. In addition to the People's Army, the Department of General Intelligence was the most notorious arm of the state-security system, feared for its use of [[torture]] and assassination.

Relations between Iraq and Egypt violently ruptured in 1977, when the two nations broke relations with each other following Iraq's criticism of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s peace initiatives with [[Israel]]. In 1978, Baghdad hosted an [[Arab League]] summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the [[Camp David Accords]]. Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation. Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's \"natural role\" among Arab countries.\n\n[[File:Arab Summit 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|left|Saddam Hussein and [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr|al-Bakr]], [[de jure]] president of Iraq alongside [[Hafez al-Assad]] of Syria at an [[Arab League Summit|Arab Summit]] in Baghdad in November 1978]]\nSaddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated [[Rolex]] wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world.

In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel (1979).\n\nSaddam initiated Iraq's nuclear enrichment project in the 1980s, with French assistance.

The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas\u2014hostile to his secular rule\u2014were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.\n\nThere had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, which Saddam tolerated. When Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. Here, Khomeini gained media connections and collaborated with a much larger Iranian community, to his advantage.\n\nAfter Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations.  In a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to [[United Nations|the United Nations]], he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the US and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.<ref name=\"PIRRR\">Esposito, John, \"Political Islam Revolution, Radicalism, or Reform\", ''Political Islam and Gulf Security'', Lynne Rienner Publishers, {{ISBN|1-55587-262-X}}, pp. 56\u201358</ref>\n\n[[File:Shakinghands high.OGG|thumb|left|thumbtime=05| Middle East special envoy [[Donald Rumsfeld]] meeting Saddam Hussein on 19\u201320 December 1983.

With the support of the Arab states, the US, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become \"the defender of the Arab world\" against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] claimed that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as \"an agent of the civilized world.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" /> The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored. Instead Iraq received economic and military support from its allies, who overlooked Saddam's use of chemical warfare against the Kurds and the Iranians, in addition to Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nIn the first days of the war, there was heavy ground fighting around strategic ports as Iraq launched an attack on Khuzestan. After making some initial gains, Iraq's troops began to suffer losses from [[human wave attack]]s by Iran. By 1982, Iraq was on the defensive and looking for ways to end the war.\n\nAt this point, Saddam asked his ministers for candid advice. Health Minister Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim suggested that Saddam temporarily step down to promote peace negotiations. Initially, Saddam Hussein appeared to take in this opinion as part of his cabinet democracy. A few weeks later, Dr. Ibrahim was sacked when held responsible for a fatal incident in an Iraqi hospital where a patient died from intravenous administration of the wrong concentration of potassium supplement.\n\nDr. Ibrahim was arrested a few days after his removal from the cabinet.

The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre-1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area. Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins.\n\nSaddam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shi'a radicalism. This backfired on Iraq and the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shi'a population.

Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off its huge debt.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\" />\n\nSaddam had consistently argued that Kuwait had historically been an integral part of Iraq, and had only come into being as a result of interference from the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]; echoing a belief that Iraqi nationalists had supported for the past fifty years. This belief was one of the few articles of faith uniting the political scene in a nation rife with sharp social, ethnic, religious, and ideological divides.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\" /> The extent of Kuwaiti oil reserves also intensified tensions in the region. The oil reserves of Kuwait (with a population of 2&nbsp;million next to Iraq's 25) were roughly equal to those of Iraq. Taken together, Iraq and Kuwait sat on top of some 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves; [[Saudi Arabia]] held another 25 percent. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraq\u2013Kuwait border.<ref name=\"Humphreys, 105\" />\n\nAs Iraq\u2013Kuwait relations rapidly deteriorated, Saddam was receiving conflicting information about how the US would respond to the prospects of an invasion. For one, Washington had been taking measures to cultivate a constructive relationship with Iraq for roughly a decade.

On 4 August an Iraqi-backed \"[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]\" was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a \"merger\" of the two countries. On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th [[Governorates of Iraq|Governorate]] of Iraq. Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, \"Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.\" Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he \"overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nWhen later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said \"When I get something into my head I act. That's just the way I am.\"<ref name=\"economist2007\" /> Saddam Hussein could pursue such military aggression with a \"military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nShortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan.

On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.<ref>Walter LaFeber, ''Russia, America, and the Cold War'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 358.</ref> On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.<ref>For a statement asserting the overriding importance of oil to U.S. national security and the U.S. economy, see, e.g., the declassified document, \"Responding to Iraqi Aggression in the Gulf,\" The White House, National Security Directive (NSD 54), top secret, 15 January 1991.

Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who happened to be in the US at the time.<ref>See Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1979\u20131990), 817.</ref>\n\nCooperation between the US and the Soviet Union made possible the passage of resolutions in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving the use of force if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. US officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich Saudi Arabia, since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the US and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as Egypt, Syria and [[Czechoslovakia]], deployed a massive number of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.\n\nSaddam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace.<ref name=\"economist2004\" />\n\nDuring the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting US- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.\n\nSaddam ignored the Security Council deadline. Backed by the Security Council, a US-led coalition launched round-the-clock missile and aerial attacks on Iraq, beginning 16 January 1991. Israel, though [[Iraqi rocket attacks on Israel|subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles]], refrained from retaliating in order not to provoke Arab states into leaving the coalition. A ground force consisting largely of US and British armored and infantry divisions ejected Saddam's army from Kuwait in February 1991 and occupied the southern portion of Iraq as far as the [[Euphrates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://milmag.com/2011/02/battle-at-rumaila/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811182711/http://milmag.com/2011/02/battle-at-rumaila/ |archive-date=11 August 2011 |title=Battle at Rumalia |work=Military Magazine |last=Pierson |first=David S. |access-date=9 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1991, Bush announced \"What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea\u2014a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=19253 |title=Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union |last=Bush |first=George |work=The American Presidency Project |publisher=University of California |access-date=9 January 2017 |archive-date=29 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129133253/http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=19253 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the end, the Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support. Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000. As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and [[biological warfare|germ weapons]] and allow UN observers to inspect the sites. UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms. Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war.\n\n== 1990s ==\n[[File:Iraq, Saddam Hussein (222).jpg|thumb|Saddam addresses state television, in January 2001]]\nIraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions. In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government. Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed. [[1991 Iraqi uprisings|Uprisings in 1991]] led to the death of 100,000\u2013180,000 people, mostly civilians.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Solomon |title=2 Mass Graves in Iraq Unearthed |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/05/world/fg-graves5 |access-date=23 September 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe US, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while [[Turkey]] opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nSaddam routinely cited his survival as \"proof\" that Iraq had in fact won the war against the US. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world. John Esposito wrote, \"Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions. That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice.\" As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] feelings.<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nOne US Muslim observer{{who|date=February 2022}} noted: \"People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America ... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him.\" A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period \"from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation.\"<ref name=\"PIRRR\" />\n\nSaddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society. Some elements of [[Sharia]] law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase \"[[Allahu Akbar]]\" (\"God is great\"), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag. Saddam also commissioned the production of a \"[[Blood Qur'an]],\" written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies.<ref name=\"BBC-2000\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/941490.stm \"Iraqi leader's Koran 'written in blood'\"].

The US launched a [[1993 cruise missile strikes on Iraq|missile attack]] aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad 26 June 1993, citing evidence of repeated Iraqi violations of the \"no fly zones\" imposed after the Gulf War and for incursions into Kuwait. US officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War's cease fire, by developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] and other banned weaponry, and violating the UN-imposed sanctions. Also during the 1990s, President [[Bill Clinton]] maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the \"Iraqi no-fly zones\" ([[1998 bombing of Iraq|Operation Desert Fox]]), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive US and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16\u201319 December 1998.
