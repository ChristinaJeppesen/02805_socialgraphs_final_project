On August 2, Washington assembled his cabinet to discuss how to deal with the situation. Unlike Washington, who had reservations about using force, Hamilton had long waited for such a situation and was eager to suppress the rebellion by using federal authority and force.{{sfn|Kohn|1972|pp=567\u2013568, 570}} Not wanting to involve the federal government if possible, Washington called on Pennsylvania state officials to take the initiative, but they declined to take military action. On August 7, Washington issued his first proclamation for calling up state militias. After appealing for peace, he reminded the protestors that, unlike the rule of the British crown, the Federal law was issued by state-elected representatives.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1pp=719\u2013721|Puls|2008|2p=219}}\n\nThreats and violence against tax collectors, however, escalated into defiance against federal authority in 1794 and gave rise to the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].

This represented the first use of federal military force against the states and citizens,{{sfn|Kohn|1972|pp=567\u2013584}} and remains the only time an incumbent president has commanded troops in the field. Washington justified his action against \"certain self-created societies\", which he regarded as \"subversive organizations\" that threatened the national union. He did not dispute their right to protest, but he insisted that their dissent must not violate federal law.

Still, he silently consented to run to prevent a further political-personal rift in his cabinet.

Sworn into office by Associate Justice [[William Cushing]] on March 4, 1793, in the Senate Chamber of [[Congress Hall]] in Philadelphia, Washington gave a brief address and then immediately retired to his Philadelphia presidential house, weary of office and in poor health.{{sfnm|Chernow|2010|1p=687|Cooke|2002|2pp=10\u201311}}\n[[File:Constitution1803.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of the frigate USS ''Constitution'' with three masts|[[USS Constitution|USS ''Constitution'']]: Commissioned and named by President Washington in 1794]]\n\nOn April 22, 1793, during the [[French Revolution]], Washington issued his famous [[Proclamation of Neutrality|Neutrality Proclamation]] and was resolved to pursue \"a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent Powers\" while he warned Americans not to intervene in the international conflict. {{sfnm|Ferling|2009|1pp=299, 304, 308\u2013311|Banning|1974|2p=2|Cooke|2002|3pp=11\u201312}} Although Washington recognized France's revolutionary government, he would eventually ask French minister to America [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat|Citizen Gen\u00eat]] be recalled over the Citizen Gen\u00eat Affair.{{sfn|Cooke|2002|pp=12\u201313}} Gen\u00eat was a diplomatic troublemaker who was openly hostile toward Washington's neutrality policy.

He did not feel bound to a two-term limit, but his retirement set a significant precedent. Washington is often credited with setting the principle of a two-term presidency, but it was Thomas Jefferson who first refused to run for a third term on political grounds.{{sfnm|Korzi|2011|1p=43|Peabody|2001|2pp=439\u2013453}}\n\n=== Farewell Address ===\n\n{{Main|George Washington's Farewell Address}}\n[[File:Washington's Farewell Address.jpg|thumb|[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington's Farewell Address]] (September 19, 1796)|alt=Newspaper showing Washington's Farewell Address]]\n\nIn 1796, Washington declined to run for a third term of office, believing his death in office would create an image of a lifetime appointment.

He participated in planning for a provisional army, but he avoided involvement in details. In advising McHenry of potential officers for the army, he appeared to make a complete break with Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans: \"you could as soon scrub the blackamoor white, as to change the principles of a profest Democrat; and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the government of this country.\"{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|1936|loc=vol. 36|p=474}} Washington delegated the active leadership of the army to Hamilton, a major general.
