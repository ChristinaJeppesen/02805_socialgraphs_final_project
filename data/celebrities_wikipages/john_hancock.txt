He served as [[President of the Continental Congress|president]] of the [[Second Continental Congress]] and was the first and third [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] of the [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], so much so that the term ''John Hancock'' or ''Hancock'' has become a nickname in the United States for one's [[signature]].<ref name=\"Unger2000\">{{cite book|author=Harlow G.

He began his political career in [[Boston]] as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Samuel Adams]], an influential local politician, though the two men later became estranged. Hancock used his wealth to support the colonial cause as tensions increased between colonists and [[Great Britain]] in the 1760s. He became very popular in Massachusetts, especially after British officials seized his sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 and charged him with smuggling. Those charges were eventually dropped; he has often been described as a smuggler in historical accounts, but the accuracy of this characterization has been questioned.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of John Hancock.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of arms of John Hancock]]\nHancock was born on January 23, 1737,{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=22, 372n48|ps=.

Not all sources fully convert his birth date to the New Style, and so the date is also given as January 12, 1736 (Old Style), January 12, 1737 (partial conversion), or January 12, 1736/7 (dual dating).}} in [[Braintree, Massachusetts]], in a part of town that eventually became the separate city of [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]].{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=22}} He was the son of Colonel [[John Hancock Jr.]] of Braintree and Mary Hawke Thaxter (widow of [[Samuel Thaxter]] Junior), who was from nearby [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]]. As a child, Hancock became a casual acquaintance of young [[John Adams]], whom the Reverend Hancock had baptized in 1735.{{sfn|Fowler |1980|p=8}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=14}} The Hancocks lived a comfortable life and owned one slave to help with household work.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=8}}\n\nAfter Hancock's father died in 1744, he was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, [[Thomas Hancock (merchant)|Thomas Hancock]] and Lydia (Henchman) Hancock. Thomas Hancock was the proprietor of a firm known as the House of Hancock, which imported manufactured goods from Britain and exported rum, whale oil, and fish.{{sfn|Fowler|2000b}} Thomas Hancock's highly successful business made him one of Boston's richest and best-known residents.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=16}} He and Lydia, along with several servants and slaves, lived in [[Hancock Manor]] on [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]]. The couple, who did not have any children of their own, became the dominant influence on John's life.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=18}}\n\nAfter graduating from the [[Boston Latin School]] in 1750, Hancock enrolled in [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] and received a bachelor's degree in 1754.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=31}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=32\u201341}} Upon graduation, he began to work for his uncle, just as the [[French and Indian War]] had begun. Thomas Hancock had close relations with the [[List of colonial governors of Massachusetts|royal governors of Massachusetts]] and secured profitable government contracts during the war.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=61}} John Hancock learned much about his uncle's business during these years and was trained for eventual partnership in the firm. Hancock worked hard, but he also enjoyed playing the role of a wealthy aristocrat and developed a fondness for expensive clothes.{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=50}}\n\nFrom 1760 to 1761, Hancock lived in England while building relationships with customers and suppliers. Upon returning to Boston, Hancock gradually took over the House of Hancock as his uncle's health failed, becoming a full partner in January 1763.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=46}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=74}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=63}} He became a member of the [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] Lodge of St. Andrew in October 1762, which connected him with many of Boston's most influential citizens.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=85}} When Thomas Hancock died in August 1764, John inherited the business, Hancock Manor, two or three household slaves, and thousands of acres of land, becoming one of the wealthiest men in the colonies.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=48\u201359}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=66\u201368}} The household slaves continued to work for John and his aunt, but were eventually freed through the terms of Thomas Hancock's will; there is no evidence that John Hancock ever bought or sold slaves.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=78}}\n\n==Growing imperial tensions==\nAfter its [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|victory in the Seven Years' War]], the [[British Empire]] was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] sought, for the first time, to directly tax the colonies, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=53}} The earlier [[Molasses Act|Molasses Act of 1733]], a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which was seen as a [[victimless crime]]. Not only was there little social stigma attached to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes, and content of their illicit cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorized. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England, brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 to the end of 1682\u2014and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively, merchants sometimes took matters into their own hands and stole illicit goods back while impounded.<ref>Smuggler Nation, Page 15</ref>\n\nThe Sugar Act provoked outrage in Boston, where it was widely viewed as a violation of colonial rights. Men such as [[James Otis Jr.|James Otis]] and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they [[no taxation without representation|could not be taxed]] by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=53}}\n[[File:Samuel_Adams_by_John_Singleton_Copley.jpg|thumb|Around 1772, Hancock commissioned John Singleton Copley to paint this portrait of Samuel Adams, Hancock's early political mentor.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=153}}]]\nHancock emerged as a leading political figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five [[Boston Board of Selectmen|selectmen]], an office previously held by his uncle for many years.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=55}} Soon after, Parliament passed the [[Stamp Act 1765|1765 Stamp Act]], a tax on legal documents such as wills that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal [[British subject]], he thought that the colonists should submit to the act even though he believed that Parliament was misguided.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=56}} Within a few months Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=58\u201360}} Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] in May 1766.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nHancock's political success benefited from the support of Samuel Adams, the clerk of the House of Representatives and a leader of Boston's \"popular party\", also known as \"Whigs\" and later as \"Patriots\". The two men made an unlikely pair. Fifteen years older than Hancock, Adams had a somber, [[Puritans|Puritan]] outlook that stood in marked contrast to Hancock's taste for luxury and extravagance.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=109}}{{sfn|Fowler|1997|p=76}} Apocryphal stories later portrayed Adams as masterminding Hancock's political rise so that the merchant's wealth could be used to further the Whig agenda.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=64}} Historian [[James Truslow Adams]] portrays Hancock as shallow and vain, easily manipulated by Adams.{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=428}} Historian [[William M. Fowler]], who wrote biographies of both men, argues that this characterization was an exaggeration and that the relationship between the two was symbiotic, with Adams as the mentor and Hancock the prot\u00e9g\u00e9.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=64\u201365}}{{sfn|Fowler|1997| p=73}}\n\n==Townshend Acts crisis==\n\nAfter the repeal of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a different approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 [[Townshend Acts]], which established new [[duty (economics)|duties]] on various imports and strengthened the [[customs]] agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the [[Navigation Acts]] by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nColonial merchants, even those not involved in smuggling, found the new regulations oppressive. Other colonists protested that new duties were another attempt by Parliament to tax the colonies without their consent. Hancock joined other Bostonians in calling for a boycott of British imports until the Townshend duties were repealed.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=111\u201314}} {{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=73}} In their enforcement of the customs regulations, the Customs Board targeted Hancock, Boston's wealthiest Whig. They may have suspected that he was a smuggler or they may have wanted to harass him because of his politics, especially after Hancock snubbed Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] by refusing to attend public functions when the customs officials were present.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=82}}{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=527\u201328}}\n\nOn April 9, 1768, two customs employees (called tidesmen) boarded Hancock's brig ''Lydia'' in [[Boston Harbor]]. Hancock was summoned, and finding that the agents lacked a [[writ of assistance]] (a general search warrant), he did not allow them to go below deck. When one of them later managed to get into the hold, Hancock's men forced the tidesman back on deck.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=530}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=103a}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=118}}<ref>The exact details and sequence of events in the ''Lydia'' affair varies slightly in these accounts.</ref> Customs officials wanted to file charges, but the case was dropped when [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] [[Jonathan Sewall]] ruled that Hancock had broken no laws.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=530\u201331}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=82}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=118\u201319}} Later, some of Hancock's most ardent admirers called this incident the first act of physical resistance to British authority in the colonies and credit Hancock with initiating the American Revolution.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=103b|ps=; Allan does not fully endorse this view.}}\n\n===''Liberty'' affair===\n\nThe next incident proved to be a major event in the coming of the American Revolution. On the evening of May 9, 1768, Hancock's sloop ''Liberty'' arrived in Boston Harbor, carrying a shipment of [[Madeira wine]]. When custom officers inspected the ship the next morning, they found that it contained 25 [[Butt (unit)|pipes]] of wine, just one fourth of the ship's carrying capacity.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=119}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=84}}{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=525}} Hancock paid the duties on the 25 pipes of wine, but officials suspected that he had arranged to have more wine unloaded during the night to avoid paying the duties for the entire cargo.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=84}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=174}} They did not have any evidence to prove this, however, since the two tidesmen who had stayed on the ship overnight gave a sworn statement that nothing had been unloaded.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=521\u201322}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=119}}\n\n[[File:John Hancock painting.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Hancock by John Singleton Copley, c. 1765|alt=Full-length portrait of a young man seated at a table. He wears a finely tailored dark suit, knee breeches with white stockings, and a wig in the style of an English gentleman. He holds a quill pen in his right hand, and is turning the pages of a large book with the other hand.]]\n\nOne month later, while the British warship [[HMS Romney (1762)|HMS ''Romney'']] was in port, one of the tidesmen changed his story: he claimed that he had been forcibly held on the ''Liberty'' while it had been illegally unloaded.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=522}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=120}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=175}} On June 10, customs officials seized the ''Liberty''. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the ''Romney'' had been [[impressment|impressing]] colonists and not just deserters from the [[Royal Navy]], an arguably illegal activity.{{sfn|Knollenberg|1975|p=63}} A riot broke out when officials began to tow the ''Liberty'' out to the ''Romney'', which was also arguably illegal.{{sfn|Knollenberg|1975|p=64}}{{sfn|Reid|1979|p=91}} The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the ''Liberty'' were mistaken for a press gang.{{sfn|Reid|1979|pp=92\u201393}} After the riot, customs officials relocated to the ''Romney'' and then to [[Fort Independence (Massachusetts)|Castle William]] (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=85}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=120}} Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.{{sfn|Reid|1979|pp=104\u201320}}\n\nBritish officials filed two lawsuits stemming from the ''Liberty'' incident: an ''[[In rem jurisdiction|in rem]]'' suit against the ship and an ''[[in personam]]'' suit against Hancock. Royal officials as well as Hancock's accuser stood to gain financially since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third.{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=186}} The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the ''Liberty'' in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] the following year.{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|pp=179\u201380}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=90}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=124}}\n\nThe second trial began in October 1768, when charges were filed against Hancock and five others for allegedly unloading 100 pipes of wine from the ''Liberty'' without paying the duties.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p= 534}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=180\u201381}} If convicted, the defendants would have had to pay a penalty of triple the value of the wine, which came to [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]9,000. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a [[vice admiralty court]], which had no jury and was not required to allow the defense to cross-examine the witnesses.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=535\u201336}} After dragging out for nearly five months, the proceedings against Hancock were dropped without explanation.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=100}}{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=539}}{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|p=183}}\n\nAlthough the charges against Hancock were dropped, many writers later described him as a smuggler.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|p=517}} The accuracy of this characterization has been questioned. \"Hancock's guilt or innocence and the exact charges against him\", wrote historian John W. Tyler in 1986, \"are still fiercely debated.\"{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=114}} Historian Oliver Dickerson argues that Hancock was the victim of an essentially criminal [[racketeering]] scheme perpetrated by Governor Bernard and the customs officials. Dickerson believes that there is no reliable evidence that Hancock was guilty in the ''Liberty'' case and that the purpose of the trials was to punish Hancock for political reasons and to plunder his property.{{sfn|Dickerson|1946|pp=518\u201325}} Opposed to Dickerson's interpretation were Kinvin Wroth and Hiller Zobel, the editors of John Adams's legal papers, who argue that \"Hancock's innocence is open to question\" and that the British officials acted legally, if unwisely.{{sfn|Wroth|Zobel|1965|pp=185\u201389|ps=, quote from p. 185.}} Lawyer and historian Bernard Knollenberg concludes that the customs officials had the right to seize Hancock's ship, but towing it out to the ''Romney'' had been illegal.{{sfn|Knollenberg|1975|pp=65\u201366, 320n41, 321n48}} Legal historian John Phillip Reid argues that the testimony of both sides was so politically partial that it is not possible to objectively reconstruct the incident.{{sfn|Reid|1979|pp=127\u201330}}\n\nAside from the ''Liberty'' affair, the degree to which Hancock was engaged in smuggling, which may have been widespread in the colonies, has been questioned. Given the clandestine nature of smuggling, records are scarce.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=13}} If Hancock was a smuggler, no documentation of this has been found. John W. Tyler identified 23 smugglers in his study of more than 400 merchants in revolutionary Boston but found no written evidence that Hancock was one of them.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|pp=5, 16, 266}} Biographer William Fowler concludes that while Hancock was probably engaged in some smuggling, most of his business was legitimate, and his later reputation as the \"king of the colonial smugglers\" is a myth without foundation.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=82}}\n\n==Massacre to Tea Party==\n[[File:Boston 1768 edit.jpeg|thumb|Paul Revere's 1768 engraving of British troops arriving in Boston was reprinted throughout the colonies.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=95\u201396}}|alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves.

A key at the bottom of the drawing indicates some prominent landmarks and the names of the warships.]]\n\nThe ''Liberty'' affair reinforced a previously made British decision to suppress unrest in Boston with a show of military might. The decision had been prompted by Samuel Adams's 1768 [[Massachusetts Circular Letter|Circular Letter]], which was sent to other [[British America]]n colonies in hopes of coordinating resistance to the Townshend Acts. [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire|Lord Hillsborough]], secretary of state for the colonies, sent four regiments of the British Army to Boston to support embattled royal officials and instructed Governor Bernard to order the Massachusetts legislature to revoke the Circular Letter. Hancock and the Massachusetts House voted against rescinding the letter and instead drew up a petition demanding Governor Bernard's recall.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=86\u201387}} When Bernard returned to England in 1769, Bostonians celebrated.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=112}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=109}}\n\nThe British troops remained, however, and tensions between soldiers and civilians eventually resulted in the killing of five civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]] of March 1770. Hancock was not involved in the incident, but afterwards he led a committee to demand the removal of the troops. Meeting with Bernard's successor, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]], and the British officer in command, Colonel [[William Dalrymple (British Army officer)|William Dalrymple]], Hancock claimed that there were 10,000 armed colonists ready to march into Boston if the troops did not leave.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=124}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=120}} Hutchinson knew that Hancock was bluffing, but the soldiers were in a precarious position when garrisoned within the town, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=124}} Hancock was celebrated as a hero for his role in getting the troops withdrawn.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=145}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=120}} His re-election to the Massachusetts House in May was nearly unanimous.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=131}}{{sfn|Brown|1955|p=271}}\n\n[[File:Hancock mezzotint.jpg|thumb|left|This portrait of Hancock was published in England in 1775.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=following 176}}]]\n\nAfter Parliament partially repealed the Townshend duties in 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended.{{sfn|Tyler|1986|p=140}} Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained.{{sfn|Brown|1955|p=268\u201369}} Hancock tried to improve his relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence.{{sfn|Brown|1955|pp=289\u201390}}{{sfn|Brown|1970|p=61n7}} In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the [[First Corps of Cadets (Massachusetts)|Boston Cadets]], a militia unit whose primary function was to provide a ceremonial escort for the governor and the General Court.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=136}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=124\u201327}} In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Council]], the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=136\u201342}}\n\nHutchinson had dared to hope that he could win over Hancock and discredit Adams.{{sfn|Brown|1955|p=285}} To some, it seemed that Adams and Hancock were indeed at odds: when Adams formed the Boston [[Committees of correspondence|Committee of Correspondence]] in November 1772 to advocate colonial rights, Hancock declined to join, creating the impression that there was a split in the Whig ranks.{{sfn|Brown|1970|pp=57\u201360}} But whatever their differences, Hancock and Adams came together again in 1773 with the renewal of major political turmoil. They cooperated in the revelation of [[Hutchinson Letters Affair|private letters]] of Thomas Hutchinson, in which the governor seemed to recommend \"an abridgement of what are called \"English liberties\" to bring order to the colony.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=150\u201352}} The Massachusetts House, blaming Hutchinson for the military occupation of Boston, called for his removal as governor.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=152}}\n\nEven more trouble followed Parliament's passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]]. On November 5, Hancock was elected as moderator at a Boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported the Tea Act was an \"Enemy to America\".{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=156\u201357}} Hancock and others tried to force the resignation of the agents who had been appointed to receive the tea shipments. Unsuccessful in this, they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in Boston Harbor. Hancock was at the fateful meeting on December 16 where he reportedly told the crowd, \"Let every man do what is right in his own eyes.\"{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=161}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=169}} Hancock did not take part in the [[Boston Tea Party]] that night, but he approved of the action, although he was careful not to publicly praise the destruction of private property.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=159\u201362}}\n\nOver the next few months, Hancock was disabled by [[gout]], which troubled him with increasing frequency in the coming years. By March 5, 1774, he had recovered enough to deliver the fourth annual [[Massacre Day]] oration, a commemoration of the Boston Massacre. Hancock's speech denounced the presence of British troops in Boston, who he said had been sent there \"to enforce obedience to acts of Parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make\".{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=163}} The speech, probably written by Hancock in collaboration with Adams, [[Joseph Warren]], and others, was published and widely reprinted, enhancing Hancock's stature as a leading Patriot.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=165\u201366}}\n\n==Revolution begins==\n[[File:17750324 Resolution - In Provincial Congress - John Hancock - The Virginia Gazette.jpg|thumb|This March 24, 1775 resolution in the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] of which Hancock was president, resolves that measures for \"putting this colony into a complete state of defense, be still most vigorously pursued by the several towns, as well as individual inhabitants\".<ref name=Resolution_17750324>{{cite news |title=IN PROVINCIAL CONGRESS / Concord, March 24, 1775 |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/williamsburg-virginia-gazette-apr-21-1775-p-15/ |work=The Virginia Gazette |date=April 21, 1775 |location=Williamsburg, Virginia |page=15 }}</ref>]]\nParliament responded to the Tea Party with the [[Boston Port Act]], one of the so-called [[Intolerable Acts|Coercive Acts]] intended to strengthen British control of the colonies. Hutchinson was replaced as governor by General [[Thomas Gage]], who arrived in May 1774. On June 17, the Massachusetts House elected five delegates to send to the [[First Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia, which was being organized to coordinate colonial response to the Coercive Acts.

The purpose of the British expedition was to seize and destroy military supplies that the colonists had stored in Concord. According to many historical accounts, Gage also instructed his men to arrest Hancock and Adams; if so, the written orders issued by Gage made no mention of arresting the Patriot leaders.{{sfn|Alden|1944|p=453}} Gage apparently decided that he had nothing to gain by arresting Hancock and Adams, since other leaders would simply take their place, and the British would be portrayed as the aggressors.{{sfn|Alden|1944|p=452}}{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=85}}\n\nAlthough Gage had evidently decided against seizing Hancock and Adams, Patriots initially believed otherwise. From Boston, Joseph Warren dispatched messenger [[Paul Revere]] to warn Hancock and Adams that British troops were on the move and might attempt to arrest them. [[Paul Revere's Midnight Ride|Revere reached Lexington around midnight]] and gave the warning.{{sfn|Fischer|1994|p=110}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=183}} Hancock, still considering himself a militia colonel, wanted to take the field with the Patriot militia at Lexington, but Adams and others convinced him to avoid battle, arguing that he was more valuable as a political leader than as a soldier.{{sfn|Fischer|1994|pp=177\u201378}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=184}} As Hancock and Adams made their escape, the first shots of the war were fired at [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Lexington and Concord]]. Soon after the battle, Gage issued a proclamation granting a general pardon to all who would \"lay down their arms, and return to the duties of peaceable subjects\"\u2014with the exceptions of Hancock and Samuel Adams.

On May 24, 1775, he was unanimously elected [[President of the Continental Congress]], succeeding [[Peyton Randolph]] after [[Henry Middleton]] declined the nomination. Hancock was a good choice for president for several reasons.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=190}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=206}} He was experienced, having often presided over legislative bodies and town meetings in Massachusetts. His wealth and social standing inspired the confidence of moderate delegates, while his association with Boston radicals made him acceptable to other radicals. His position was somewhat ambiguous because the role of the president was not fully defined, and it was not clear if Randolph had resigned or was on a leave of absence.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=191}} Like other presidents of Congress, Hancock's authority was mostly limited to that of a presiding officer.{{sfn|Fowler|2000a}} He also had to handle a great deal of official correspondence, and he found it necessary to hire clerks at his own expense to help with the paperwork.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=205}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=237}}\n\nIn Congress on June 15, 1775, Massachusetts delegate [[John Adams]] nominated [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief of the army then gathered around Boston.

This brief comment from 1801 is the only source for the oft-cited claim that Hancock sought to become commander-in-chief.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=669}} In the early 20th century, historian [[James Truslow Adams]] wrote that the incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between Hancock and Washington, but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that the incident, or the estrangement, ever occurred. According to historian Donald Proctor, \"There is no contemporary evidence that Hancock harbored ambitions to be named commander-in-chief. Quite the contrary.\"{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=670}} Hancock and Washington maintained a good relationship after the alleged incident, and in 1778 Hancock named his only son ''John George Washington Hancock''.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=675}} Hancock admired and supported General Washington, even though Washington politely declined Hancock's request for a military appointment.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=215}}{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=672}}\n\nWhen Congress recessed on August 1, 1775, Hancock took the opportunity to wed his fianc\u00e9e, [[Dorothy Quincy|Dorothy \"Dolly\" Quincy]].

As president, Hancock may have signed the document that was sent to the printer [[John Dunlap]], but this is uncertain because that document is lost, perhaps destroyed in the printing process.{{sfn|Boyd|1976|p=450}} Dunlap produced the first published version of the Declaration, the widely distributed [[Physical history of the United States Declaration of Independence|Dunlap broadside]]. Hancock, as President of Congress, was the only delegate whose name appeared on the broadside, although the name of [[Charles Thomson]], secretary of the Continental Congress but not a delegate, was also on it as \"Attested by\" implying that Hancock had signed the fair copy. This meant that until a second broadside was issued six months later with all of the signers listed, Hancock was the only delegate whose name was publicly attached to the treasonous document.{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=230\u201331}} Hancock sent a copy of the Dunlap broadside to George Washington, instructing him to have it read to the troops \"in the way you shall think most proper\".{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=242}}\n\nHancock's name was printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic signature appears on a different document\u2014a sheet of parchment that was carefully handwritten sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present.{{sfn|Boyd|1976|pp=464\u201365}} Known as the engrossed copy, this is the famous document on display at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration.html|title=Declaration of Independence|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|access-date=November 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Return to Massachusetts==\n\n[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|325px|alt=About 50 men, most of them seated, are in a large meeting room.

When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.{{sfn|Fowler|2000a}}{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=207, 220, 230}}\n\nBack in Boston, Hancock was re-elected to the House of Representatives. As in previous years, his philanthropy made him popular. Although his finances had suffered greatly because of the war, he gave to the poor, helped support widows and orphans, and loaned money to friends. According to biographer William Fowler, \"John Hancock was a generous man and the people loved him for it. He was their idol.\"{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=225\u201326}} In December 1777, he was re-elected as a delegate to the Continental Congress and as moderator of the Boston town meeting.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=225}}\n[[File:Hancock House, Ticonderoga, NY.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hancock House (Ticonderoga, New York)|Hancock House]], a replica of [[Hancock Manor]] in Boston, was built in Ticonderoga, New York, by the Ticonderoga Historical Society and is open as a museum.]]\n\nHancock rejoined the Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief time there was unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected [[Henry Laurens]] as its new president, which was a disappointment to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams and missed his wife and newborn son.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=230\u201331}} On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the [[Articles of Confederation]]; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles were not ratified until 1781.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=270}}\n\nHancock returned to Boston in July 1778, motivated by the opportunity to finally lead men in combat. Back in 1776, he had been appointed as the senior major general of the Massachusetts militia.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=207}} Now that the French fleet had come to the aid of the Americans, General Washington instructed General [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] to lead an [[Battle of Rhode Island|attack on the British garrison]] at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in August 1778. Hancock nominally commanded 6,000 militiamen in the campaign, although he let the professional soldiers do the planning and issue the orders. It was a fiasco: French Admiral [[Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing|d'Estaing]] abandoned the operation, after which Hancock's militia mostly deserted Sullivan's Continentals.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=232\u201334}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=270\u201373}} Hancock suffered some criticism for the debacle but emerged from his brief military career with his popularity intact.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=234\u201335}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|pp=274\u201375}} \n\nAfter much delay, the [[Constitution of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Constitution]] finally went into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected [[Governor of Massachusetts]] in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=243\u201344}} In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably patriotic given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) to serve in the First Continental Congress.{{sfn|Morse|1909|pp=21\u201322}} Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.{{sfn|Hall|1972|p=134}}\n\nHancock governed Massachusetts through the end of the Revolutionary War and into an economically troubled postwar period, repeatedly winning re-election by wide margins. Hancock took a hands-off approach to governing, avoiding controversial issues as much as possible. According to William Fowler, Hancock \"never really led\" and \"never used his strength to deal with the critical issues confronting the commonwealth.\"{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=246\u201347, 255}} Hancock governed until his surprise resignation on January 29, 1785. Hancock cited his failing health as the reason, but he may have become aware of growing unrest in the countryside and wanted to get out of office before the trouble came.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=258\u201359}}\n\nHancock's critics sometimes believed that he used claims of illness to avoid difficult political situations.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=222}} Historian James Truslow Adams writes that Hancock's \"two chief resources were his money and his gout, the first always used to gain popularity, and the second to prevent his losing it\".{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=430}} The turmoil that Hancock avoided ultimately blossomed as [[Shays' Rebellion]], which Hancock's successor Bowdoin had to deal with. After the uprising, Hancock was re-elected in 1787, and he promptly pardoned all the rebels.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=265\u201366}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=311}} The next year, a controversy arose when three free blacks were kidnapped from Boston and sent to work as slaves in the French colony of [[Martinique]] in the West Indies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&pg=PA26 Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1]</ref>  Governor Hancock wrote to the governors of the islands on their behalf.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vrs9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA212 The Collected Works of Theodore Parker: Discourses of slavery]</ref>  As a result, the three men were released and returned to Massachusetts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mlsSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA328 John Hancock: The Picturesque Patriot]</ref> Hancock was re-elected to annual terms as governor for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=xvi}}\n\n==Final years==\n\n[[File:HancockGrave.jpg|thumb|Hancock's memorial in Boston's [[Granary Burying Ground]], dedicated in 1896{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=viii}}]]\n\nWhen he had resigned as governor in 1785, Hancock was again elected as a delegate to Congress, known as the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] after the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1781. Congress had declined in importance after the Revolutionary War and was frequently ignored by the states. Hancock was elected to serve as its president on November 23, 1785, but he never attended because of his poor health and because he was disinterested. He sent Congress a letter of resignation in June 1786.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=264}}\n\nIn an effort to remedy the perceived defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 and then to the [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787, where they drafted the [[Constitution of the United States|United States Constitution]], which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the Constitution's lack of a [[bill of rights]] and its shift of power to a central government.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|pp=267\u201369}} In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=268}} Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=270}} Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=271}}{{sfn|Allan|1948|pp=331\u201332}}\n\nHancock was put forth as a candidate in the [[1788\u201389 United States presidential election|1789 U.S. presidential election]]. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that Washington was going to be elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=274}} Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=275}} Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=275}}\n\nHis health failing, Hancock spent his final few years as essentially a figurehead governor. With his wife at his side, he died in bed on October 8, 1793, at age 56.{{sfn|Fowler|1980|p=279}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=330}} By order of acting governor Samuel Adams, the day of Hancock's burial was a state holiday; the lavish funeral was perhaps the grandest given to an American up to that time.{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=358}}{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=331}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:USS John Hancock Stern.jpg|thumb|275px|Hancock's famous signature on the stern of the destroyer [[USS John Hancock (DD-981)|USS ''John Hancock'']]]]\n\nDespite his grand funeral, Hancock faded from [[collective memory|popular memory]] after his death. According to historian [[Alfred F.

His house on Beacon Hill was torn down in 1863 after both the city of Boston and the Massachusetts legislature decided against maintaining it.{{sfn|Young|1999|p=120}} According to Young, the conservative \"new elite\" of Massachusetts \"was not comfortable with a rich man who pledged his fortune to the cause of revolution\".{{sfn|Young|1999|p=120}} In 1876, with the centennial of American independence renewing popular interest in the Revolution, plaques honoring Hancock were put up in Boston.{{sfn|Young|1999|p=191}} In 1896, a memorial column was erected over Hancock's essentially unmarked grave in the [[Granary Burying Ground]].{{sfn|Allan|1948|p=viii}}\n\nNo full-length biography of Hancock appeared until the 20th century. A challenge facing Hancock biographers is that, compared to prominent [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] like [[Thomas Jefferson]] and John Adams, Hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians to use in interpreting his life. As a result, most depictions of Hancock have relied on the voluminous writings of his political opponents, who were often scathingly critical of him. According to historian Charles Akers, \"The chief victim of Massachusetts historiography has been John Hancock, the most gifted and popular politician in the Bay State's long history. He suffered the misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through the judgments of his detractors, Tory and Whig.\"{{sfn|Akers|1974|p=130}}\n\nHancock's most influential 20th-century detractor was historian [[James Truslow Adams]], who wrote negative portraits of Hancock in ''Harper's Magazine'' and the ''Dictionary of American Biography'' in the 1930s.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=654}} Adams argued that Hancock was a \"fair presiding officer\" but had \"no great ability\", and was prominent only because of his inherited wealth.{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=428}} Decades later, historian Donald Proctor argued that Adams had uncritically repeated the negative views of Hancock's political opponents without doing any serious research.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=676}} Adams \"presented a series of disparaging incidents and anecdotes, sometimes partially documented, sometimes not documented at all, which in sum leave one with a distinctly unfavorable impression of Hancock\".{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=657}} According to Proctor, Adams evidently projected his own disapproval of 1920s businessmen onto Hancock{{sfn|Proctor|1977|p=676}} and ended up misrepresenting several key events in Hancock's career.{{sfn|Proctor|1977|pp=658\u201375}} Writing in the 1970s, Proctor and Akers called for scholars to evaluate Hancock based on his merits rather than on the views of his critics. Since that time, historians have usually presented a more favorable portrait of Hancock while acknowledging that he was not an important writer, political theorist, or military leader.{{sfn|Nobles|1995|pp=268, 271}}\n\nMany places and things in the United States have been named in honor of Hancock. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] has named vessels [[USS Hancock|USS ''Hancock'']] and [[USS John Hancock|USS ''John Hancock'']]; a World War II [[Liberty ship]] was also named in his honor.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=355}} Ten states have a [[Hancock County (disambiguation)|Hancock County]] named for him;{{sfn|Gannett|1973|p=148}} other places named after him include [[Hancock, Massachusetts]]; [[Hancock, Michigan]]; [[Hancock, New Hampshire]]; [[Hancock, New York]]; and [[Mount Hancock (New Hampshire)|Mount Hancock]] in New Hampshire.{{sfn|Gannett|1973|p=148}} The defunct [[John Hancock University]] was named for him,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hancocku.edu/about-jhu/|title=About John Hancock University|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|access-date=January 14, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203162539/http://www.hancocku.edu/about-jhu/|archive-date=February 3, 2013}}</ref> as was the [[John Hancock Financial]] company, founded in Boston in 1862; it had no connection to Hancock's own business ventures.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=337}} The financial company passed on the name to the [[John Hancock Tower]] in Boston, the [[John Hancock Center]] in Chicago, as well as the [[John Hancock Student Village]] at [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T1sxAAAAIBAJ&pg=1784,159250|title=Firm not signing away its name|work=[[Reading Eagle]]| agency=Associated Press| date=October 1, 2003|page=D6|access-date=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Hancock was a charter member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1780.<ref name=\"AAAS\">{{cite web|title=Charter of Incorporation of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences|url=https://www.amacad.org/content/about/about.aspx?d=23|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617015414/https://www.amacad.org/content/about/about.aspx?d=23|archive-date=June 17, 2018|access-date=July 28, 2014|website=American Academy of Arts and Sciences}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|United States|Politics}}\n* [[List of richest Americans in history]]\n* [[List of wealthiest historical figures]]\n* [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence]]\n* [[Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence]]\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |last1= Adams |first1=James Truslow |author-link1=James Truslow Adams|date=September 1930|title=Portrait of an Empty Barrel |journal=Harpers Magazine  |volume=161   |pages= 425\u201334}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Akers |first1= Charles W.|date=March 1974 |title=Sam Adams\u2014And Much More |journal= New England Quarterly |volume= 47|issue= 1|pages=120\u201331|doi=10.2307/364333|jstor= 364333}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Alden |first1=John R. |year=1944 |title=Why the March to Concord? |journal=The American Historical Review |volume= 49 |pages=446\u201354|doi=10.2307/1841029 |issue=3|jstor=1841029 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Allan | first = Herbert S. | year = 1948 | title = John Hancock: Patriot in Purple | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York }}\n* {{cite journal |last1= Boyd|first1=Julian P. |author-link1=Julian P.
