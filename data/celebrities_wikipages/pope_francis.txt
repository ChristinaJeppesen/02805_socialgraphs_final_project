{{IPA-it|ber\u02c8\u0261\u0254\u028e\u028eo|}} (Italian)}} 17 December 1936) is the head of the [[Catholic Church]]. He has been sovereign of the [[Vatican City State]] since 13 March 2013. Francis is the first [[pope]] to be a member of the [[Society of Jesus]], the first from the [[Americas]], the first from the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the first pope from outside Europe since [[Pope Gregory III|Gregory III]], a Syrian who reigned in the 8th century.\n\nBorn in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], Bergoglio worked for a time as a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] and a [[janitor]] as a young man before training to be a chemist and working as a technician in a [[food science]] laboratory. After recovering from a severe illness, he was inspired to join the [[Jesuits|Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) in 1958. He was ordained a [[Catholic priest]] in 1969, and from 1973 to 1979 was the Jesuit [[provincial superior]] in Argentina. He became the [[archbishop of Buenos Aires]] in 1998 and was created a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] in 2001 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. He led the Argentine Church during the [[December 2001 riots in Argentina]]. The administrations of [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner]] considered him to be a political rival. Following the [[resignation of Pope Benedict XVI]] on 28 February 2013, [[2013 papal conclave|a papal conclave]] elected Bergoglio as his successor on 13 March. He chose Francis as his [[papal name]] in honor of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]]. Throughout his public life, Francis has been noted for his humility, emphasis on God's mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to [[Pope Francis: ecumenism and interreligious dialogue|interreligious dialogue]]. He is credited with having a less formal approach to the papacy than his predecessors, for instance choosing to reside in the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]] guesthouse rather than in the [[papal apartments]] of the [[Apostolic Palace]] used by previous popes.\n\nFrancis maintains the views of the church regarding [[Abortion and the Catholic Church|abortion]], [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]], and the [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|ordination of women]], but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of [[deaconess]]es and has made women full members of [[dicasteries]] in the [[Roman Curia]]. He maintains that the church should be more open and welcoming for members of the [[LGBT community]]. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled [[capitalism]] and free market economics, [[consumerism]], and [[overdevelopment]];<ref>{{cite web|date=15 December 2013|work=The Guardian|title=Pope says he is not a Marxist, but defends criticism of capitalism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/15/pope-francis-defends-criticism-of-capitalism-not-marxist}}</ref> he advocates taking action on [[climate change]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|date=7 September 2021|title=Christian leaders unite to issue stark warning over climate crisis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/07/christian-leaders-unite-to-issue-stark-warning-over-climate-crisis|access-date=7 September 2021|website=The Guardian|language=en}}</ref> a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of ''[[Laudato si']]''.
