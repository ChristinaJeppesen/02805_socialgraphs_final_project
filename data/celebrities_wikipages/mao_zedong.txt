(surname)|Mao]]|Ze|textonly=yes}}}} (26 December 1893 \u2013 9 September 1976), also known as '''Chairman Mao''', was a [[Chinese communist]] [[revolutionary]] who was the [[List of national founders|founder]] of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which he led as the [[chairman of the Chinese Communist Party]] from the [[Establishment of the People's Republic of China|establishment of the PRC]] in 1949 until [[Death and state funeral of Mao Zedong|his death]] in 1976. Ideologically a [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]], his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as [[Maoism]].\n\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in [[Shaoshan]], [[Hunan]]. He supported [[Chinese nationalism]] and had an [[anti-imperialist]] outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911 and [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at [[Peking University]] as a librarian and became a founding member of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), leading the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] in 1927. During the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the CCP, Mao helped to found the [[Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]], led the [[Jiangxi Soviet]]'s radical land reform policies, and ultimately became head of the CCP during the [[Long March]]. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under the [[Second United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after [[Victory over Japan Day|Japan's surrender]], and Mao's forces defeated the [[Nationalist government]], which withdrew to [[Taiwan]] in 1949.\n\nOn 1 October 1949, Mao [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed the foundation of the PRC]], a Marxist\u2013Leninist [[single-party state]] controlled by the CCP. In the following years he solidified his control through the [[Chinese Land Reform]] against landlords, the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], the \"[[Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns]]\", and through a psychological victory in the [[Korean War]], which altogether resulted in the deaths of several million Chinese. From 1953 to 1958, Mao played an important role in enforcing [[planned economy]] in China, constructing the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China|first Constitution of the PRC]], launching the industrialisation [[Industry of China|program]], and initiating military projects such as the \"[[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\" project and [[Project 523]]. His foreign policies during this time were dominated by the [[Sino-Soviet split]] which drove a wedge between China and the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1955, Mao launched the [[Sufan movement]], and in 1957 he launched the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], in which at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents, were persecuted.<ref name=\"1Mac\">{{Cite book |last=MacFarquhar |first=Roderick |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrkpx6iKq48C&dq=550000+anti-rightist+china&pg=PA82 |title=The Politics of China: The Eras of Mao and Deng |date=13 January 1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-58863-8 |language=en}}</ref> In 1958, he launched the [[Great Leap Forward]] that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] to [[Industrial society|industrial]], which led to the [[Great Chinese Famine|deadliest famine in history]] and the deaths of 15\u201355 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the [[Socialist Education Movement]], and in 1966 he initiated the [[Cultural Revolution]], a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent [[class struggle]], widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of [[Mao's cult of personality]]. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its [[family planning policy]].\n\n<!-- Legacy -->A controversial figure within and outside China, Mao is still regarded as one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century. Beyond politics, Mao is also known as a theorist, military strategist, and poet. During the Mao era, China was heavily involved with other southeast Asian communist conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], and the [[Cambodian Civil War]], which brought the [[Khmer Rouge]] to power. The government during Mao's rule was responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, [[Laogai|prison labour]], and mass executions.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ian|author-link=Ian Johnson (writer)|date=5 February 2018|title=Who Killed More: Hitler, Stalin, or Mao?|url=https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/02/05/who-killed-more-hitler-stalin-or-mao/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180205193203/https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2018/02/05/who-killed-more-hitler-stalin-or-mao/|archive-date=5 February 2018|access-date=18 July 2020|website=The New York Review of Books|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=Fenby|first=Jonathan|url=https://archive.org/details/modernchinafallr00fenb/page/351/mode/2up|title=Modern China: The Fall and Rise of a Great Power, 1850 to the Present|publisher=[[Penguin Group]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0061661167|pages=351|author-link=Jonathan Fenby}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Schram|first=Stuart|author-link=Stuart R.

Under this economic program, the relatively small agricultural collectives that had been formed to date were rapidly merged into far larger [[people's commune]]s, and many of the peasants were ordered to work on massive infrastructure projects and on the production of iron and steel.

Based upon the falsely reported success, party cadres were ordered to requisition a disproportionately high amount of that fictitious harvest for state use, primarily for use in the cities and urban areas but also for export. The result, compounded in some areas by drought and in others by floods, was that farmers were left with little food for themselves and many millions starved to death in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. The people of urban areas in China were given food stamps each month, but the people of rural areas were expected to grow their own crops and give some of the crops back to the government. The death count in rural parts of China surpassed the deaths in the urban centers.

After the July 1959 [[Lushan Conference|clash at Lushan]] Conference with [[Peng Dehuai]], Mao launched a new anti-rightist campaign along with the radical policies that he previously abandoned. It wasn't until the spring of 1960, that Mao would again express concern about abnormal deaths and other abuses, but he did not move to stop them.

Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper [[smelting]] conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward: \"We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise.

The most direct of these was Minister of Defence and Korean War veteran General [[Peng Dehuai]]. Following Peng's criticism of the Great Leap Forward, Mao orchestrated a purge of Peng and his supporters, stifling criticism of the Great Leap policies. Senior officials who reported the truth of the famine to Mao were branded as \"right opportunists.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Becker|1998|pp=92\u201393}}</ref> A campaign against right-wing opportunism was launched and resulted in party members and ordinary peasants being sent to prison labour camps where many would subsequently die in the famine.

Until the mid-1980s, when official census figures were finally published by the Chinese Government, little was known about the scale of the disaster in the Chinese countryside, as the handful of Western observers allowed access during this time had been restricted to model villages where they were deceived into believing that the Great Leap Forward had been a great success. There was also an assumption that the flow of individual reports of starvation that had been reaching the West, primarily through Hong Kong and Taiwan, must have been localised or exaggerated as China was continuing to claim record harvests and was a net exporter of grain through the period. Because Mao wanted to pay back early to the Soviets debts totalling 1.973 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] from 1960 to 1962,<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\"/> exports increased by 50%, and fellow Communist regimes in [[North Korea]], [[North Vietnam]] and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] were provided grain free of charge.<ref name=\"Becker81\"/>\n\nCensuses were carried out in China in 1953, 1964 and 1982. The first attempt to analyse this data to estimate the number of famine deaths was carried out by American demographer Dr. Judith Banister and published in 1984. Given the lengthy gaps between the censuses and doubts over the reliability of the data, an accurate figure is difficult to ascertain. Nevertheless, Banister concluded that the official data implied that around 15 million excess deaths incurred in China during 1958\u201361, and that based on her modelling of Chinese demographics during the period and taking account of assumed under-reporting during the famine years, the figure was around 30 million. [[Hu Yaobang]], a high-ranking official of the CCP, states that 20 million people died according to official government statistics.<ref>{{Harvnb|Short|2001|p=761}}</ref> [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], a former [[Xinhua News Agency]] reporter who had privileged access and connections available to no other scholars, estimates a death toll of 36 million.<ref name=\"Yang Jisheng\">Mark O'Neill.

He saw that the revolution and Great Leap Forward had replaced the old ruling elite with a new one. He was concerned that those in power were becoming estranged from the people they were to serve. Mao believed that a revolution of culture would unseat and unsettle the \"ruling class\" and keep China in a state of \"perpetual revolution\" that, theoretically, would serve the interests of the majority, rather than a tiny and privileged elite.<ref>{{harvnb|Feigon|2002|p=140}}</ref> State Chairman [[Liu Shaoqi]] and General Secretary [[Deng Xiaoping]] favoured the idea that Mao be removed from actual power as China's head of state and government but maintain his ceremonial and symbolic role as Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, with the party upholding all of his positive contributions to the revolution. They attempted to marginalise Mao by taking control of economic policy and asserting themselves politically as well. Many claim that Mao responded to Liu and Deng's movements by launching the [[Cultural Revolution|Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] in 1966.
