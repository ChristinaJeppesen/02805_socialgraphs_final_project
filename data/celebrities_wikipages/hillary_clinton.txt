A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she was the party's [[2016 Democratic National Convention|nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party; Clinton won the popular vote, but lost the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] vote, thereby losing the election to [[Donald Trump]].\n\nRaised in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]], Rodham graduated from [[Wellesley College]] in 1969 and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973. After serving as a [[congressional staff|congressional legal counsel]], she moved to [[Arkansas]] and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, Clinton co-founded [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]]. She was appointed the first female chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's [[Rose Law Firm]] the following year. ''[[The National Law Journal]]'' twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of [[Arkansas]] from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for [[Healthcare reform in the United States|healthcare reform]]. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|Clinton health care plan]]\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]], and the [[Foster Care Independence Act]]. Clinton [[Women's Rights Are Human Rights|advocated for gender equality]] at the [[Fourth World Conference on Women|1995 UN conference on women]]. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the [[Lewinsky scandal]], which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.\n\nIn 2000, Clinton was [[2000 United States Senate election in New York|elected]] as the first female [[List of United States senators from New York|senator from New York]] and became the first First lady to simultaneously hold elected office, and then the first former First lady to serve in the Senate. She was [[2006 United States Senate election in New York|re-elected in 2006]] and chaired the [[United States Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee|Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee]] from 2003 to 2007.

In 2008, Clinton [[Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential campaign|ran for president]] but was defeated by eventual winner [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]]. Clinton was U.S. Secretary of State in the first term of the [[Obama administration]] from 2009 to 2013. During her [[Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State|tenure]], Clinton established the [[Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review]]. She responded to the [[Arab Spring]] by [[War Powers Resolution|advocating]] [[military intervention in Libya]] but was harshly criticized by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]]. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international [[sanctions against Iran]] in an effort to force it to curtail its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]]; this effort eventually led to the multinational [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|JCPOA nuclear agreement]] in 2015. [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|Her use of a private email server]] when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nClinton made a [[Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign|second presidential run in 2016]], winning the Democratic nomination, and ran in the general election with Virginia senator [[Tim Kaine]] as her [[Vice President of the United States|running mate]]. Clinton lost the [[2016 United States presidential election|presidential election]] to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], despite winning the [[Popular vote (representative democracy)|popular vote]].
