Psi Com broke up around 1985 and Farrell met [[Eric Avery]] through mutual friends. The two began jam sessions which would become the initial foundation for Jane's Addiction. It was during this period that Bernstein chose the pseudonym Perry Farrell for himself as a play on the word \"peripheral\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/farrell_perry/artist.jhtml|title=Perry Farrell &#124; New Music And Songs|publisher=MTV|access-date=July 13, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614091119/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/farrell_perry/artist.jhtml|archive-date=June 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Jane's Addiction <small>(1985\u20131991, 1997, 2001\u20132004, 2008\u2013present)</small>===\nJane's Addiction made its name in mid-1980s LA by building up a rabid fan base with legendary, high-energy shows in small LA rock clubs. Jane's Addiction, prior to their first break-up, released three albums: ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]''. A B-sides album from the ''Ritual'' sessions, titled ''Live and Rare,'' was released in Japan. Late in 1991, Jane's Addiction broke up due to internal tensions over differing ideologies mostly centering on drug use, notably Farrell's severe addiction to heroin. Around this time, as mentioned in the ''Spin'' magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3) article about their \"Ritual\" tour, a rumor got around that Farrell had contracted HIV. Apparently for amusement, Farrell would tease audiences with \"news\" of his supposed health and would neither confirm nor deny its truth. In 1993 Farrell and his ex-girlfriend Casey Niccoli released a film called ''[[Gift (1993 film)|Gift]]'' that featured Jane's Addiction. ''Gift'' was released by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1997, Jane's Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] replacing Avery on bass.\n\nFarrell has sometimes been credited with changing the fortunes of the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicfestivals/p/coachella.htm|title=Coachella Music Festival \u2013 Coachella \u2013 Profile of Coachella Music Festival|publisher=Musicians.about.com|date=June 22, 2013|access-date=July 13, 2013}}</ref> Following the festival's disastrous first year in 1999, the event was not held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the [[Goldenvoice|festival organizers]], decided to reunite Jane's Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major artist each year.\n\nFarrell again toured with Jane's Addiction in 2001 and 2003.  In 2003, Jane's Addiction released an album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]''. It quickly became one of their best selling records and was certified Gold in the USA and Silver in UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database \u2013 July 12, 2013 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=July 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archive-date=June 26, 2007  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218103035/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076|date=February 18, 2009}}</ref> They toured extensively in North America and Europe, brought back [[Lollapalooza]] for the first time since 1997, as well as performing at the [[Big Day Out]] festivals in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Internal struggles saw the band split up again in early 2004. A \"best of\" release following the breakup of this incarnation of the band was released in 2006, titled ''[[Up from the Catacombs - The Best of Jane's Addiction|Up from the Catacombs]]''.\n\nThe four original members of Jane's Addiction played their first show together in 17 years at the first United States edition of the NME Awards on April 23, 2008, and played two small shows in Los Angeles during late 2008. The reunited Jane's Addiction re-debuted at [[SXSW]] in 2009 and kicked off a summer tour with [[Nine Inch Nails]]. Eric Avery again left the band in late 2009, leaving Farrell, Navarro and Perkins as the remaining members of Jane's Addiction. The band with [[Dave Sitek]] on bass released ''[[The Great Escape Artist]]'' in 2011 and have continued to tour.\n\n===Porno for Pyros (1992\u20131998)===\n\nFollowing the break-up of Jane's Addiction, Farrell formed [[Porno for Pyros]] with former bandmate [[Stephen Perkins]] as well as newcomers [[Peter DiStefano]] on guitar and [[Martyn LeNoble]] on bass. Together they released two albums, ''[[Porno for Pyros (album)|Porno for Pyros]]'' and ''[[Good God's Urge]]''.\n\n===Solo career (1999\u2013present)===\n[[File:PerryFarrellJune07.jpg|thumb|Farrell performing at the London Astoria in June 2007]]\n\nKicking off his solo career, Farrell released ''[[Rev (Perry Farrell album)|rev]]'' in 1999, a compilation featuring songs from his previous two bands as well as two new solo songs. In 2001, he released his debut solo album, ''[[Song Yet to Be Sung]]'', with lyrics inspired by [[Kabbalah]].\n\nFarrell has released a number of solo tracks online, all of them recorded with the involvement of wife Etty Lau.
