Robertson advocates a [[christian right|conservative Christian]] ideology and is known for his past activities in [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[party politics]]. He is associated with the [[Charismatic Movement]] within Protestant [[evangelicalism]]. He serves as chancellor and CEO of [[Regent University]] and chairman of the [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN).\n\nOn Robertson's own account, he originally set out to be a businessman. He graduated near the top of his class at [[Yale Law School]] in 1955 but later failed the New York bar exam, which he described as a minor setback since he never planned to practice law and he already had a career with a major corporation on Wall Street. He became a Christian while having dinner at a restaurant in Philadelphia with an author and WWII veteran, Cornelius Vanderbreggen. After his conversion, Robertson left the corporate world and went into ministry.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/06/03/pat-robertsons-noble-cause/34cd02ee-1ce9-452f-a52f-a9033f9d3aa4/ Pat Robertson's 'Noble Cause'] at The Washington Post; by Michael Barone; published June 3, 1986; retrieved May 4, 2022</ref>\n\nSpanning over five decades, Robertson is the founder of major organizations including The [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] (CBN), [[Regent University]], [[Operation Blessing International|Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation]], the [[ABC Family Worldwide Inc.|International Family Entertainment Inc.]] ([[ABC Family|ABC Family Channel/Freeform]]), the [[American Center for Law & Justice]] (ACLJ), the Founders Inn and Conference Center, and the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]].<ref name=\"officialbio\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |title=About Us |publisher=[[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] |access-date=2007-03-31 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070308053058/http://www.cc.org/about.cfm |archive-date = March 8, 2007}}</ref> \n\nFounded in 1978, Operation Blessing is the humanitarian organization that has helped millions of people in more than 90 countries and territories through services including [[drinking water|safe water]], hunger relief, medical aid, [[Emergency management|disaster relief]], as well as vulnerable children and [[orphan]] care. \n\nRobertson is also a best-selling author and the former host of ''[[The 700 Club]]'', a Christian News and TV program broadcast live weekdays on Freeform (formerly ABC Family) from CBN studios, as well as on channels throughout the United States, and on CBN network [[Network affiliate|affiliates]] worldwide.<ref name=\"officialbio\" /> Robertson announced his retirement at the age of 91 from the 700 Club in October 2021, on the sixtieth anniversary of the first telecast on October 1, 1961 of what eventually became CBN.<ref>{{cite news |title=US televangelist Pat Robertson says 'God is not a Republican' during TV interview |url=https://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/us-televangelist-pat-robertson-says-god-is-not-a-republican-during-tv-interview/60929.htm |access-date=December 10, 2021 |work=Ecumenical News |date=October 19, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe son of [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Absalom Willis Robertson|A.

His parents were [[Absalom Willis Robertson]] (1887\u20131971), a [[conservative Democrat]]ic [[United States Senate|Senator]], and Gladys Churchill ([[n\u00e9e]] Willis; 1897\u20131968), a housewife and a musician. At a young age, Robertson was nicknamed ''Pat'' by his six-year-old brother, Willis Robertson, Jr., who enjoyed patting him on the cheeks when he was a baby while saying \"pat, pat, pat\". Later, Robertson thought about which first name he would like people to use. He considered \"Marion\" to be effeminate, and \"M. Gordon\" to be affected, so he opted for his childhood nickname \"Pat\".<ref name=\"davidjohnmarley\" />\n\nWhen he was eleven, Robertson was enrolled in the preparatory [[McDonogh School]] outside [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. From 1940 until 1946 he attended [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where he graduated with honors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regent.edu/about-regent/leadership/m-g-pat-robertson|title=M.G. \"Pat\" Robertson|website=Regent University|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Freemasons in America: Inside the Secret Society|last=Jeffers|first=H.

He was also a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the nation\u2019s most prestigious academic honor society.<ref name=\"officialbio\" /> He joined [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity. Robertson has said, \"Although I worked hard at my studies, my real major centered around lovely young ladies who attended the nearby girls schools.\"<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/education/ \"Education\"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, the [[Conscription|draft]] was reinstated and Robertson was given the option of joining the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] or being drafted into the [[United States Army|Army]]; he opted for the first.\n\nRobertson described his military service as follows: \"We did long, grueling marches to toughen the men, plus refresher training in firearms and bayonet combat.\" In the same year, he transferred to [[Korea]], \"I ended up at the headquarters command of the First Marine Division,\" says Robertson. \"The Division was in combat in the hot and dusty, then bitterly cold portion of [[North Korea]] just above the 38th Parallel later identified as the 'Punchbowl' and 'Heartbreak Ridge.'\" For Robertson's service in the [[Korean War]], the US Marines awarded him three Battle Stars.<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/militaryservice/ \"Military Service\"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref>\n\nIn 1986, Former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Pete McCloskey|Paul \"Pete\" McCloskey, Jr.]], who served with Robertson in Camp Pendleton, wrote a public letter challenging Robertson\u2019s record in the military.

He then went on to receive a law degree from [[Yale Law School]] in 1955, near the top of his class. However, he failed his first and only attempt at the New York bar exam necessary for admission to the [[New York State Bar Association]].<ref>[http://www.patrobertson.com/SpiritualJourney/SomethingMissing.asp \"Spiritual Journey\"], The Official Site of Pat Robertson.</ref>, which did not deter Robertson because he never intended to practice law anyway.  Shortly thereafter he underwent a religious conversion and decided against pursuing a career in business. Instead, Robertson attended [[New York Theological Seminary|The Biblical Seminary in New York]], where he received a [[Master of Divinity]] degree in 1959.\n\n==''Christian Broadcasting Network''==\n{{Main|Christian Broadcasting Network}}\nIn 1956, Robertson met Dutch missionary Cornelius Vanderbreggen, who impressed Robertson both by his lifestyle and his message. Vanderbreggen quoted [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (3:5, 6), \"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths\", which Robertson considers to be the \"guiding principle\" of his life. He was ordained as a minister of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in 1961.\n\nIn 1960, Robertson established the Christian Broadcasting Network in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]]. He started it by buying the license of a defunct [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] station in nearby [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. The station, with the call sign WYAH-TV, first broadcast on October 1, 1961. On April 29, 1977, CBN launched a religious [[cable television|cable network]], the CBN Satellite Service, which eventually became The Family Channel.\n\nIn 1977 CBN became the first direct-to-cable, satellite-delivered television channel in America, delivering content to cable systems all over the country. The venture became so lucrative that it could not continue to be kept under a tax-exempt charity, so Robertson spun off The Family Channel into a separate commercial entity that was sold to [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] for $1.9 billion in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Web Site Design and Hosting by LogicalSolutions.net \u2013 An Internet Marketing Company |url=http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |title=Student Press Law Center \u2013 News Flashes |publisher=Splc.org |date=October 18, 2007 |access-date=2009-07-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212011926/http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1655&year |archive-date=December 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, he was an endorser of the document ''[[Evangelicals and Catholics Together]]''.\n\n==''Regent University''==\n{{Main|Regent University}}\nRobertson founded CBN University, a private Christian university, in 1977 on CBN's Virginia Beach campus. Since its founding, the university has established eight academic schools and offers [[Associate degree|associate]], [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|master's]], and [[Doctorate|doctoral]] degrees in over 150 areas of study. It was renamed Regent University in 1990. According to the school's catalog, \"a regent is one who represents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of life he or she may be called to serve Him.\"\n\nWith more than 11,000 current students, Regent University has ranked the #1 Best Online Bachelor\u2019s Program in Virginia for ten years in a row by ''U.S. News & World Report'', 2022, as well as 2023 Best Graduate Schools-Law, Best Graduate Schools \u2013 Social Sciences and Humanities Doctoral Programs \u2013 Psychology, 2023 Best Graduate Schools \u2013 Public Affairs, and 2023 Best Education Schools by ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/regent-university-30913 Regent University] at ''U.S. News & World Report''; retrieved May 4, 2022</ref> Robertson serves as its [[chancellor (education)|chancellor]] and CEO.\n\nRobertson is also founder and president of the [[American Center for Law & Justice]], a major public interest law firm headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]] and associated with [[Regent University School of Law]] in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], that defends Constitutional freedoms and [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] ideals.

Robertson announced the launch of Operation Blessing live on The 700 Club that same day, writing on a blackboard for his viewers that the program would feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and house the homeless. The idea was to match the ability of some viewers to donate with the needs of other audience members.\n\nThe program quickly grew, and in 1986 Robertson organized the Operation Blessing International Relief and Development Corporation, which expanded the program\u2019s services from assisting individuals to large scale humanitarian operations through four core program areas: disaster relief, medical care, hunger relief and clean water.\n\nOperation Blessing purchased a fleet of [[Semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailer trucks]] to deliver thousands of pounds of food, water and other essential products to a network of food pantries and churches across the country, which he called the ''Hunger Strike Force''. In the last year, the Hunger Strike Force delivered more than 44 million pounds of food, beverages and other supplies to families in need.\n\nOperation Blessing also began sending medical teams to third world countries to help people who had no access to medical care. In 1994, in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan genocide]], Robertson solicited donations to provide medical supplies to refugees in neighboring [[Zaire]] (present-day Congo), where Robertson also had exploratory diamond mining operations.<ref>Marlow Stern, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/07/doc-mission-congo-alleges-pat-robertson-exploited-post-genocide-rwandans-for-diamonds.html \"\u2018Mission Congo\u2019 Alleges Pat Robertson Exploited Post-Genocide Rwandans For Diamonds\"], Daily Beast, September 7, 2013.</ref> According to a 1999 article in [[The Virginian-Pilot]], two Operation Blessing pilots who were interviewed alleged that the organization's planes were used to haul diamond-mining equipment to Robertson's mines in Zaire. Robertson has adamantly denied the pilots\u2019 accounts, and public records show that Operation Blessing did in fact conduct major humanitarian relief efforts in that country.<ref>[https://www.vqronline.org/articles/response-pat-robertson\u2019s-attorney Response from Pat Robertson\u2019s Attorney] at The Virginia Quarterly Review; published April 15, 2008; retrieved May 25, 2022</ref><ref>David John Marley, Pat Robertson: An American Life (Rowman & Littlefield, 2007), p. 190.</ref>\n\nRobertson also established a U.S. [[Emergency management|disaster relief]] team which has since responded to numerous major natural and humanitarian disasters, including [[Hurricane Katrina]], earthquakes in Haiti, China, and Nepal, the [[Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia|Ebola outbreak in Liberia]], [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine| Russia\u2019s 2022 war against Ukraine]], and dozens of other hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes.\n\nSince its founding Operation Blessing has been dedicated to its mission of demonstrating God\u2019s love by alleviating human need and suffering, touching the lives of millions of people in more than 90 countries and in every state.

Robertson was the founder and co-chairman of [[International Family Entertainment Inc.]] (IFE).\n\nFormed in 1990, IFE produced and distributed family entertainment and information programming worldwide. IFE's principal business was The Family Channel, a satellite delivered cable-television network with 63 million U.S. subscribers. IFE, a publicly held company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], was sold in 1997 to [[Fox Kids]] Worldwide, Inc. for $1.9 billion, whereupon it was renamed [[Fox Family Channel]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired FFC in 2001 and its name was changed again, to ABC Family. The network was renamed to [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] on January 12, 2016, though Robertson's sale of the channel continues to require Freeform to carry four hours of CBN/''700 Club'' programming per weekday, along with CBN's yearly [[telethon]].\n\nRobertson is a global businessman with media holdings in [[Asia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Africa]]. He struck a deal with [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based [[General Nutrition Center]] to produce and market a weight-loss shake he created and promoted on ''The 700 Club''.\n\nIn 1999, Robertson entered into a joint venture with the [[Bank of Scotland]] to provide financial services in the United States.
