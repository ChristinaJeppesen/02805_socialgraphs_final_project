Supporters of the council proposal believed that having a council would produce a higher degree of unity in society and more positive characteristics would be found in a council, while the opposers believed that an individual leader was more efficient according to the past experiences in case of Judiciary council.<ref name=\"Raja\" />\n\nEbrahim Amini listed the summary of reasons presented by the two sides. According to him the opposers rejected the proposal because: i) Evidences for [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist]] were true only for the guardianship of an individual and it was not clear who held the guardianship when there was a council. Guardianship of a council was not rooted in Hadiths and Islamic jurisprudence. ii) Previous council type organizations such as broadcasting council and supreme judicial council were not successful in practice and leadership council would not do well for similar reasons. iii) People were accustomed to the leadership of an individual and a council of leaders was something unfamiliar to them. iv) An individual leader could act more decisive when dealing with critical and important decisions and solving problems and crisis. On the other hand, the supporters of the proposal believed that: i) At the time, there were no [[Faq\u012bh|''Faqih'']] equal to Khomeini or even two or three levels lower than him so that he could fulfill the expectation of people. ii) In case of council of leaders, the members could compensate each other, if any of them had some shortage in a field.<ref name=\"Raja\" />\n\nFinally, 45 members voted against the leadership council proposal while more than 20 people were in favor of it and the proposal was rejected.<ref name=\"Fars-1\" /> After the assembly rejected the idea of a Leadership Council, Khamenei was elected Leader by 60 of the 74 members present with Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani]] receiving the remaining 14 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hashemirafsanjani.ir/content/%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%88%D8%B5%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%9F-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%DA%AF%D9%84%D9%BE%D8%A7%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B3%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3 |script-title=fa:\u0686\u0631\u0627 \u0622\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0648\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u0631\u0627 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u062f\u061f/ \u067e\u06cc\u0634\u0646\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0631\u0647\u0628\u0631\u06cc \u0622\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u06af\u0644\u067e\u0627\u06cc\u06af\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0633\u0648\u06cc \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0647 \u0645\u062f\u0631\u0633\u06cc\u0646 |author=Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani |date=4 June 1989 |work=\u0628\u0627\u0632\u0633\u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0648 \u0633\u0627\u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc |language=fa |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130620012317/http://www.hashemirafsanjani.ir/content/%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%88%D8%B5%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%9F-%D9%BE%DB%8C%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%DA%AF%D9%84%D9%BE%D8%A7%DB%8C%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%B3%D9%88%DB%8C-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3 |archive-date=20 June 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khobreganrahbari.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=76 |title=\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0647\u0628\u0631\u06cc \u2013 \u0631\u064a\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u062c\u0645\u0639 \u062a\u0634\u062e\u064a\u0635 \u0645\u0635\u0644\u062d\u062a \u0646\u0638\u0627\u0645: \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0647\u0645\u062a\u0631\u064a\u0646 \u067e\u064a\u0634\u0631\u0641\u062a\u200c\u0647\u0627\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0646\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u060c \u062a\u0623\u0633\u064a\u0633 \u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u064a \u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0641\u0642\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f[\u0627\u064a\u0644\u0646\u0627&#93;
