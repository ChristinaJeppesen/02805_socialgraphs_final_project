After actresses [[Suzanne Zenor]] and [[Susan Lanier]] did not impress producers during the first two [[Pilot episode|pilots]], Somers was suggested by ABC president  [[Fred Silverman]], who had seen her on the ''[[Tonight Show]]'' and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. She portrayed [[Chrissy Snow]], a stereotypical [[Blonde stereotype|dumb blonde]], who was employed as an office [[secretary]].\n\nThe series co-starred [[John Ritter]] and [[Joyce DeWitt]] in a [[comedy of errors]] about two single women  living with a single man who pretends to be [[Homosexuality|gay]] in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], eventually spawning a short-lived [[The Ropers|spin-off series]] (starring [[Norman Fell]] and [[Audra Lindley]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=Horace Newcomb|title=Encyclopedia of Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUzIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2327|date=3 February 2014|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-135-19479-6|page=2327}}</ref>\n\nWhen ''Three's Company'' began its fifth season in late 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences.\nAfter ABC denied her a raise in salary, Somers refused to appear in the second and fourth episodes of the season, due to excuses such as a broken rib. She finished the remaining season on her contract, but her role was decreased to just 60 seconds per episode, her character only appearing in the episode's closing tag in which Chrissy calls the trio's apartment from her parents' home. After ABC fired her from the program and terminated her contract, Somers sued the network for $2 million, saying her credibility in show business had been damaged. The lawsuit was settled by an arbitrator who decided Somers was owed $30,000, due to a single missed episode for which she had not been paid. Future rulings also favored the network and  producers. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as [[Alan Alda]] and [[Carroll O'Connor]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohen|first=Y|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/interviews/female-comedians-funny-actresses|title=We'll Show You Who's FUNNY|work=[[Marie Claire]]|date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317124355/http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/interviews/female-comedians-funny-actresses|archive-date=2009-03-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Suzanne Somers through her Hamel/Somers Productions had signed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures Television]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=1983-09-05|title=Fates & Fortunes|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/83-OCR/BC-1983-09-05-OCR-Page-0106.pdf|access-date=2021-09-26}}</ref>\n\nSomers and her ''Three's Company'' co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|date=February 1, 2011|title=Suzanne Somers made peace with John Ritter before his death|url=https://blog.seattlepi.com/people/2011/02/01/suzanne-somers-made-peace-with-john-ritter-before-his-death/|access-date=2020-09-24|website=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===''Playboy'' pictorials===\nSomers appeared in two ''[[Playboy]]'' cover-feature nude pictorials, in 1980 and 1984. Her first set of nude photos was taken by [[Stan Malinowski]] in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. She was accepted as a Playmate candidate in 1971, but declined to pose nude before the actual shoot. During an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', she denied ever posing nude (except for a ''[[High Society (magazine)|High Society]]'' topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20075637,00.html|title=Naked Came the Danger to Suzanne Somers' Career, but She Had An Ace Up Her Sleeve|work=people.com}}</ref> Somers' original motivation for posing nude was to be able to pay medical bills related to injuries her son Bruce Jr. suffered in a car accident. By the time the photos were published, her son was 14 and Somers feared  seeing his mother posing nude would be difficult for him. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000\u2014which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]].<ref name=\"first-playboy\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/43141333/ |title=Playboy exposure continues to haunt Suzanne Somers |last=Dangaard |first=Colin |publisher=[[Ottawa Journal]]|date=1980-03-26|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref> The second nude pictorial by [[Richard Fegley]] appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the ''Three's Company'' debacle in 1981. Despite her anger and the earlier lawsuit, Playboy approached her earlier that year to pose nude a second time. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial.<ref name=\"second-playboy\">{{cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/11/06/Scotts-World-Suzanne-bares-all/4965468565200/ |title=Scott's World: Suzanne bares all |last=Scott |first=Vernon |publisher=[[UPI]]|date=1984-11-06|access-date=2018-03-18}}</ref>\n\n===Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster===\nDuring the 1980s, Somers became a [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] entertainer.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Emmis Communications|title=Orange Coast Magazine|journal=Orange Coast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37|date=July 1988|publisher=Emmis Communications|page=37|issn=0279-0483}}</ref> In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the [[Thighmaster]], a piece of [[exercise equipment]] that is squeezed between one's thighs.

In 1987, she starred in the sitcom ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'', which ran in [[first-run syndication]]. Somers portrayed a widow with two young kids who decided to fill the shoes of her late husband, a sheriff of a Nevada town. The show ran for two seasons.\n\n===''Step by Step''===\nIn 1990, Somers returned to network TV, appearing in numerous guest roles and made-for-TV movies, mostly for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Her roles in these, including the movie ''[[Rich Men, Single Women]]'', attracted the attention of [[Lorimar Television]] and [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], who were developing a new sitcom. Somers had starred in the film with [[Heather Locklear]], who inadvertently directed the focus of both production companies to Somers due to Locklear's starring role on ''[[Going Places (American TV series)|Going Places]]'' (from Lorimar and Miller/Boyett). For Lorimar, this was asking Somers back, since they alone had produced ''[[She's the Sheriff]]''.\n\nIn September 1991, Somers returned to series TV in the sitcom ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step By Step]]'' (with [[Patrick Duffy]]), which became a success on ABC's youth-oriented ''[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]'' lineup. A week after the premiere of ''Step By Step'', a two-hour biopic of Somers starring the actress herself, entitled ''Keeping Secrets'' (based on her first autobiography of the same title), was broadcast on ABC. The movie chronicled Somers' troubled family life and upbringing, along with her subsequent rise to fame. Playing off her rejuvenated career, Somers also launched a daytime talk show in 1994, aptly titled ''Suzanne Somers'', which lasted one season. ''Step By Step'' continued on ABC until the end of its sixth season in 1997, whereupon the series moved to CBS that fall for what turned out to be its final season. With her sitcom now airing on CBS, Somers was chosen to co-host the network's revival of ''[[Candid Camera]]'' with [[Peter Funt]], which began airing later that season.<ref name=\"boomsbeat.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|title = Suzanne Somers|url = http://www.starpulse.com/Actresses/Somers,_Suzanne/Biography/|website = Starpulse|access-date = 2016-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===''Candid'' cohost===\nFrom 1997\u201399, Somers cohosted the revised ''[[Candid Camera]]'' show, when CBS chose to bring it back with [[Peter Funt]].
