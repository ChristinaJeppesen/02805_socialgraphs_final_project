John declared that both his cousins had become \"poster boys for bad behavior\"\u2014believed to be the first time a member of the Kennedy family had publicly attacked another Kennedy.

Though the magazine had already begun to decline in popularity before Berman left, his departure was followed by a rapid drop in sales.<ref name=Heymann438/>\n\n[[David Pecker]], CEO of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines who were partners in ''George'', said the decline was because Kennedy refused to \"take risks as an editor, despite the fact that he was an extraordinary risk taker in other areas of his life.\" Pecker said, \"He understood that the target audience for ''George'' was the eighteen-to-thirty-four-year-old demographic, yet he would routinely turn down interviews that would appeal to this age group, like [[Princess Diana]] or [[John Gotti Jr.]], to interview subjects like [[Dan Rostenkowski]] or [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]].\"<ref name=Heymann438>Heymann, p. 438.</ref>\nShortly before his death, Kennedy had been planning a series of online chats with the 2000 presidential candidates.
