He became president of his father's real estate business in 1971 and renamed it [[The Trump Organization]]. He expanded the company's operations to building and renovating skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He later started side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. From 2004 to 2015, he co-produced and hosted the reality television series ''[[The Apprentice (American TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies.\n\nTrump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, isolationist, and nationalist. He won the [[2016 United States presidential election]] as the Republican nominee against Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] despite losing the national popular vote.{{efn|name=electoral-college|Presidential elections in the United States are decided by the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. Each state names a number of electors equal to its representation in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and (in most states) all electors vote for the winner of their state's popular vote.}} He became the first U.S. president with no prior military or government service. His election and policies sparked numerous protests.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 20. --> The 2017\u20132019 special counsel investigation led by [[Robert Mueller]] established that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to favor the election of Trump. Trump promoted conspiracy theories and made many false and misleading statements during his campaigns and presidency, to a degree unprecedented in American politics.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], items 49 and 53. --> Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist,<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 30. --> and many as misogynistic.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE this sentence without prior consensus, see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 51. -->\n\nTrump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding towards building a wall on the U.S.\u2013Mexico border, and implemented a policy of family separations for apprehended migrants.<!-- This sentence must contain a summary of Trump's actions on immigration, including the Muslim travel ban, the wall, and the family separation policy; see [[Talk:Donald Trump#Current consensus]], item 52. --> He rolled back more than 100 environmental policies and regulations in an aggressive attempt to weaken environmental protections. Trump signed the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] which cut taxes for individuals and businesses and rescinded the individual health insurance mandate penalty of the Affordable Care Act. He appointed 54 federal appellate judges and three United States Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump initiated a trade war with China and withdrew the U.S. from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. Trump met with North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] three times, but made no progress on denuclearization. He reacted slowly to the COVID-19 pandemic, ignored or contradicted many recommendations from health officials in his messaging, and promoted misinformation about unproven treatments and the need for testing.\n\nTrump lost the [[2020 United States Presidential Election|2020 presidential election]] to [[Joe Biden]] but refused to concede defeat, falsely claiming widespread electoral fraud and attempting to overturn the results by pressuring government officials, mounting scores of unsuccessful legal challenges, and obstructing the presidential transition. On January 6, 2021, Trump urged his supporters to march to the [[United States Capitol]], which many of them then attacked, resulting in multiple deaths and interrupting the electoral vote count. In November 2022, he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump is the only American president to have been impeached twice. After he pressured Ukraine in 2019 to investigate Biden, he was impeached by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December. The [[United States Senate|Senate]] acquitted him of both charges in February 2020.<!-- PLEASE DISCUSS BEFORE CHANGING THIS LANGUAGE. --> The House of Representatives impeached Trump a second time in January 2021, for incitement of insurrection. The Senate acquitted him in February, after he had already left office. Since leaving office, Trump has remained heavily involved in the Republican Party, including making over 200 political endorsements during the 2022 midterm elections.
