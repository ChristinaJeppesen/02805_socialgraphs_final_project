He was also Chairman of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] and [[President of the European Council]] in 2006. In his earlier career, he was a journalist. Vanhanen is the son of professor [[Tatu Vanhanen]] and Anni Tiihonen.\n\n==Career==\nVanhanen studied [[political science]] at the [[University of Helsinki]], graduating as a Master of [[Social Science]]s in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |title=Yleisen valtio-opin laitos |publisher=Valt.helsinki.fi |date=31 March 2008 |access-date=23 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703051031/http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/vol/laitos/alumni/index.htm |archive-date=3 July 2010}}</ref> He was chairman of the Centre Party Youth League from 1980 to 1983. He also served as a member of the [[Espoo]] City Council from 1981 to 1984. Vanhanen used to work as a journalist. He was an editor (1985\u20131988) and editor-in-chief (1988\u20131991) at the local newspaper ''Keh\u00e4sanomat''. In a column in ''[[Suomenmaa]]'' (the Centre Party's organ), he strongly condemned the ''Baltic Star'' pro-Estonian independence demonstration held in Helsinki in July 1985, calling the demonstration \"provocative\".<ref>[http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html Matti Vanhanen, Suomenmaa 30.7.1985 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720185147/http://kavkaz.fi/vanhanen.html |date=20 July 2011 }}</ref>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0806-010, LPG Gierst\u00e4dt, Besuch einer finnischen Jugenddelegation.jpg|thumb|250px|Vanhanen (third from right) visited the [[East Germany|GDR]] in 1988.]]\n\nVanhanen was elected to the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament (Eduskunta)]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|date=8 June 2020|title=N\u00e4k\u00f6kulma: Matti Vanhanen taipui pelastajaksi, vaikka ei ollut innokas siirtym\u00e4\u00e4n takaisin ministeriauton takapenkille|url=https://www.aamulehti.fi/kotimaa/art-2000007551918.html|access-date=29 July 2021|website=Aamulehti|language=fi}}</ref> As a member of Parliament he was interested in ecological issues. For instance, Vanhanen spoke against the building of a fifth [[nuclear power plant]] in 1992, at the same time as serving on the board of electricity corporation [[Fortum]]. He served on the Parliamentary Environment Committee 1991\u20131995, and was chair of the Parliamentary Grand Committee 2000\u20132001. He was vice-chair of the Centre Party Parliamentary group 1994\u20132001, and Deputy Chairman of the Centre Party 2000\u20132003.\n\nAnother important topic for Vanhanen was [[Foreign relations of Finland|Finland's foreign and security policy]]. As a specialist on the [[European Union]] he was a member of the [[Convention on the Future of Europe|European Union Constitutional Convention]]. There he criticised the president of the convention, former French president [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], as [[authoritarian]]. Vanhanen has said<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suomenkuvalehti.fi/?id=5835 |title=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |publisher=Suomenkuvalehti.fi |date=12 March 2010 |access-date=23 June 2010}}</ref> that he is unenthusiastic about European co-operation, and that he is an \"EU pragmatist\", so he may be considered a [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]], especially when compared to his EU-enthusiast predecessor [[Paavo Lipponen]].\n\nVanhanen served as Chairman of the Youth Foundation from 1998 to 2003 and Deputy chairman from 1981 to 1997. The prosecution claims the Youth Foundation donated under the direction of Centre Party MP [[Antti Kaikkonen]] funding of over 90,000 euros for his own campaign and that of other Centre Party MPs including Matti Vanhanen. Prosecutors say this contravened the Foundation's own rules and laws governing such institutions.<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/vanhanen_no_talk_of_campaign_funding_in_youth_foundation/6330074 Vanhanen: No talk of campaign funding in Youth Foundation, Former Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen took the witness stand today in the trial of former leaders of the Youth Foundation] yle 10 October 2012</ref>\n\n===Vanhanen's first cabinet===\nVanhanen resigned from the Constitutional Convention in 2003 when he became Minister of Defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]]. After J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki's resignation, Vanhanen [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|was elected Prime Minister]] and [[Matti Vanhanen's first cabinet|his first cabinet]] was formed.\n\nAs a politician, Vanhanen is considered to be part of the liberal wing of the old agrarian Central Party, along with the two other Party ministers from [[Uusimaa|Uusimaa region]]. His government cut the top state income tax rate from 35.5% to 33.5% in 2005 and 32.5% in 2006 (resulting in approximately 55% total tax rate after local government and social security taxes). The corporate tax rate was also lowered to 26% and capital gains to 28% (both formerly 29%), though at the same time dividends were partially made taxable.\n\n===Presidential candidate===\n[[File:World leaders at the 32nd G8 Summit, Strelna, Russia - 20060716.jpg|thumb|right|Vanhanen after [[2006 Finnish presidential election|Finnish 2006 presidential elections]] in G8 Summit in [[Strelna]], Russia. Left to right: [[Romano Prodi]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Jacques Chirac]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Junichiro Koizumi]], [[Stephen Harper]], Matti Vanhanen and [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]].]]\nAs the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] candidate, Vanhanen challenged [[president of Finland|President]] [[Tarja Halonen]] in the [[2006 Finnish presidential election]]. He received 18.6% of the vote, coming third to the [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]]'s [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] (24.1%) and [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrat]] and incumbent [[Tarja Halonen]] (46.3%), and thus did not qualify for the runoff. Vanhanen expressed his support for Niinist\u00f6 in the runoff election against his coalition partner's candidate Halonen.\n\nThe presidential election, and co-operation between Centre Party and National Coalition Party, proved to be a major strain on the government coalition between the Centre Party and Social Democrats. The flashpoint came in March, when the Centre Party demanded national [[Agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] to cover farmers' losses when the Finnish exception in the European Union's [[Common Agricultural Policy]] was about to expire. At the end of the crisis Vanhanen told his parliamentary group that taxpayers would cover ninety percent or about 100 million euros in losses.\n\nMatti Vanhanen received 25,000 euros for his presidential election campaign in 2006 from [[Ahti Vilppula]] via his company Helsingin Mekaanikkotalo. Mekaanikkotalo is owned by Procomex in [[Luxembourg]] and further by Kilbrin Investments Limited in the [[Virgin Islands]].<ref>Matti Yl\u00f6nen Veroparatiisit, 20 ratkaisua varjotalouteen Like 2008 page 108 {{in lang|fi}}</ref> In 2009 it was found out that this finance was not included in the finance announcement.\n\n===Vanhanen's second cabinet===\n[[File:Vanhasen II hallitus.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Vanhanen's second cabinet.]]\nAfter the [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|March 2007 election]] the Centre Party narrowly remained the largest party after losing four seats. However their coalition partner, the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|SDP]], lost eight seats and the centre-right [[National Coalition Party (Finland)|National Coalition Party]] gained ten. [[Matti Vanhanen's second cabinet|Vanhanen's second cabinet]] was formed on a centre-right basis, with minor partners the [[Green League]] and the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]].\n\nA scandal involving Vanhanen's second cabinet began rolling in May 2008, after the leader of the Centre Party's parliamentary group [[Timo Kalli]] said publicly that he would not reveal information about his [[campaign finance]]s, because such disclosure was not required. After a media backlash, Kalli gave up his secrecy and listed a group of businessmen known as \"Kehittyvien maakuntien Suomi\" (KMS; in English, \"The Finland of Developing Regions\"), who had financed the Centre Party. Centre Party links with KMS were suspected, as one address of the organisation belonged to a party official. It was later revealed that the organisation had been formed in the Centre Party's general secretary's office.\n\nAfter the Russian response to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia, Vanhanen said that Finland would rethink its security.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |title=Vanhanen: Finland to Rethink Security Following Crisis in Georgia |publisher=Yle.fi |access-date=23 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229204507/http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2008/08/vanhanen_finland_to_rethink_security_following_crisis_in_georgia_314968.html |archive-date=29 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nVanhanen's cabinet proposed raising the retirement age from 63 to 65 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/200902289164604_uu.shtml |title=Vanhanen: El\u00e4kei\u00e4n korotus l\u00e4hti minun aloitteestani |publisher=Iltalehti.fi |date=28 February 2009 |access-date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/kotimaa.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2009/02/818706 |title=Vanhanen: El\u00e4kei\u00e4n nostolla maksetaan laman laskut |publisher=Mtv3.fi |date=25 February 2009 |access-date=23 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-5730671 |title=PM Vanhanen: \"Necessary to Raise Pension Age\" |publisher=Yle.fi |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=23 June 2010 }}</ref> His proposal was fiercely opposed by the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]] (Finnish acronym SAK), which is affiliated with the SDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taloussanomat.fi/tyomarkkinat/2009/03/02/sak--uhkaa-katkaista-valit-hallitukseen/20095555/12 |title=SAK uhkaa katkaista v\u00e4lit hallitukseen |publisher=Taloussanomat.fi |date=3 February 2009 |access-date=23 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, Vanhanen announced that he would step down as chair of the Centre Party at its June 2010 convention.

Because the charges concerned Vanhanen's actions while in office, the decision whether he should be prosecuted fell to the Constitutional Law Committee of the [[Finnish Parliament]].
