Cabaret. His success in these venues led to appearances on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and ''Buscando Estrellas,'' where he attained the title \"International Comedy Grand Champion.\" Then, in 1994, Mencia was chosen to host [[Home Box Office|HBO's]] [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|latino]] comedy showcase ''Loco Slam.''\n\nMencia followed up ''Loco Slam'' by hosting ''Funny is Funny!'' on [[Galavisi\u00f3n (USA)|Galavision]] in 1998. He would continue to do [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]], including a successful tour in 2001 with [[Freddy Soto]] and [[Pablo Francisco]], \"The Three Amigos.\" Mencia also did two half-hour specials on HBO, the second of which won him a [[CableACE Award]] for ''Best Stand-Up Comedy Special.''

The show achieved moderate success in its first season and was brought back for a second season in the spring of 2006, becoming Comedy Central's second highest-rated program behind ''[[South Park]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2006/071206_mencia_thirdseason_pickup.jhtml | title = Comedy central delves deeper into the \"mind of mencia\" and orders third season | publisher = Comedy Central | access-date = 2006-10-21}}</ref> It was brought back for a third season that summer before being cancelled in 2008.
