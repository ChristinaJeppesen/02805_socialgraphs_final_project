After learning to speak English, she signed on to [[Epic Records]] in the United States. In 1990, Dion released her debut English-language album, ''[[Unison (Celine Dion album)|Unison]]'', establishing herself as a viable pop artist in North America and other English-speaking areas of the world. Her recordings since have been mainly in English and French although she has also sung in Spanish, Italian, German, Latin, Japanese, and Chinese.\n\nDuring the 1990s, she achieved worldwide fame after releasing several best-selling English-language albums in music history, such as ''[[Falling into You]]'' (1996) and ''[[Let's Talk About Love]]'' (1997), which were both certified [[RIAA certification#RIAA Diamond certifications|diamond]] in the US and over 30 million sales worldwide each.
