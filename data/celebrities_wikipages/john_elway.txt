He was also a prolific [[Rush (American and Canadian football)|rusher]] of the ball, being one of only two players to score a rushing touchdown in four different Super Bowls (the other being [[Thurman Thomas]]) and the only quarterback to do so.<ref name=\"nfl.com\">[http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/records/superbowls/player/passing \"Super Bowl Records: Individual Passing\"], NFL.com</ref><ref name=\"Super Bowl Leaders\">[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/super-bowl/leaders.htm \"Super Bowl Leaders\"], Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref> Elway is also only one of two quarterbacks (the other being [[Peyton Manning]], also with the Denver Broncos) to retire after a [[Super Bowl]] victory.\n\nElway set several career records for passing attempts and completions while at Stanford and also received [[All-America]]n honors. He was the first selection in the [[1983 NFL Draft]], famously known as the quarterback class of 1983, where he was taken by the [[1983 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] before being traded to the Denver Broncos. In January 1987, Elway embarked on one of the most notable performances in sports and in NFL history, helping engineer a 98-yard, game-tying [[touchdown]] drive in the [[AFC Championship Game]] against the [[1986 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], a moment later dubbed \"[[The Drive]]\". Following that game in Cleveland, Elway and the Broncos lost in [[Super Bowl XXI]] to the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].\n\nAfter two more Super Bowl losses, the Broncos entered a period of decline; however, that ended during the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|1997 season]], as Elway and Denver won their first Super Bowl title by defeating the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 31\u201324 in [[Super Bowl XXXII]]. The Broncos repeated as champions the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|following season]] in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] by defeating the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] 34\u201319. Elway was voted MVP of that Super Bowl, which was the last game of his career, and in doing so Elway set a then-record five Super Bowl starts which was broken in February 2015 when [[Tom Brady]] of the [[New England Patriots]] started [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. After his retirement as a player, Elway served as general manager and executive vice president of football operations of the Broncos, which won four division titles, two AFC Championships, and [[Super Bowl 50]] during his tenure, making Elway a three-time Super Bowl Champion with the Broncos - two as a player and one as an executive. Elway was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 2000 and the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2004.\n\n==Early life==\nElway and his twin sister Jana were born on June 28, 1960 in [[Port Angeles, Washington]] to Janet ([[n\u00e9e]] Jordan) and [[Jack Elway]], then the head coach at [[Port Angeles High School]].

With two minutes remaining in the game, Stanford was down 19\u201317 and had 4th-and-17 on their own 13-yard line. Elway completed a 29-yard pass and drove the ball downfield to the 35-yard line, where Mark Harmon kicked what appeared to be the winning field goal. However, the clock had four seconds remaining, so Stanford had to kick off.

In a span of 5 minutes and 2 seconds, Elway led his team 98 yards to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation. The Broncos won the game in overtime. Elway and the Broncos started out the Super Bowl against the [[1986 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] very well, building a 10\u20137 lead and then driving to the Giants 1-yard line in the second quarter. However, the Broncos lost five yards on their next three plays and came up empty after kicker [[Rich Karlis]] missed the field goal attempt. From that point on, the rest of the game went downhill for the Broncos. Elway was sacked in the end zone for a safety on the Broncos ensuing possession, cutting their lead to 10\u20139. Then in the second half, the Giants scored 30 points and ended up winning the game 39\u201320. Still, Elway had an impressive performance, throwing 304 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, while also leading Denver in rushing with 27 yards and a touchdown on the ground.\n\n[[File:1987 Atlanta Falcons Pocket Schedule (crop).jpg|right|thumb|Elway (center) getting tackled by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in 1985]]\nIn the [[1987 Denver Broncos season|1987 season]], Elway was selected to start in the [[American Football Conference]]'s (AFC) [[Pro Bowl]] team and won the [[NFL Most Valuable Player Award]]. He went on to once again lead the Broncos to a victory over the Browns in the AFC title game, earning their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, this one against the [[Washington Redskins]]. The game started out very well for Denver, and they built up a 10\u20130 lead by the end of the first quarter. At the time, no team had overcome a 10\u20130 deficit in the Super Bowl. But in the second quarter, the Redskins suddenly stormed back with a record 35 points, and ended up winning [[Super Bowl XXII]] 42\u201310. Elway did have a few highlights. His 56-yard touchdown pass to [[Ricky Nattiel]] after just 1:57 had elapsed in the game set a record for the fastest touchdown in Super Bowl history, at the time. He also became the first quarterback to catch a pass in the Super Bowl, recording a 23-yard reception from halfback [[Steve Sewell]] on a [[halfback option play]]. With a porous defense unable to stop the Redskins offense, Elway was forced to take more risks on the offensive end. As a result, Elway's performance was rather disappointing: just 14 out of 38 completions for 257 yards and one touchdown, with three interceptions.\n\nAfter recording an 8\u20138 record in 1988, Elway once again led his team to the Super Bowl after the [[1989 Denver Broncos season|1989 season]], with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] in [[Super Bowl XXIV]]. However, this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55\u201310, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try to hide from the media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he was asked if he wanted to go back to the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. However, many doubted that he would win a Super Bowl in his career.\n\nIt took Elway another eight years, but he eventually led his team back to the Super Bowl, following the [[1997 Denver Broncos season|1997 season]]. During the preseason [[American Bowl]] game in [[Mexico City]], Elway ruptured his right (throwing arm) [[biceps brachii muscle|biceps]] [[tendon]]. It was treated non-surgically, and he returned to play 19 days later, and the team advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXII]], Elway's fourth, where they faced the [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], the [[Super Bowl XXXI|defending champions]]. Despite Elway completing only 11 of 22 passes, throwing no touchdowns, but one interception, the Broncos defeated the Packers 31\u201324, winning their first Super Bowl, after three failed attempts for Elway (and four for the team).\n\nIn the [[1998 Denver Broncos season|1998 season]], the Broncos repeated this feat and Elway was named [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], throwing 336 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, while also scoring a rushing touchdown in Denver's 34\u201319 win over the [[1998 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. It was his last game, other than the [[1999 Pro Bowl]].\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:David Petraeus, Lynn Swann, Roger Craig, John Elway, Roger Goodell at Super Bowl 43.jpg|right|thumb|Elway (second from right) at [[Super Bowl XLIII]] with [[Lynn Swann]], [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]], [[Roger Goodell]], and General [[David Petraeus]]]]\nOn May 2, 1999, at age 38, Elway announced his retirement from professional football. Elway is regarded as one of the top quarterbacks to play the game. He has one of the best winning percentages in league history (148\u201382\u20131), and was tied for the second-most [[Pro Bowl]] selections for a quarterback (nine) at the time of his retirement. Elway played in 22 postseason games with the Broncos, 21 as a starter, and led the team to victory in 14 of them. In those games he threw 4,964 yards and 27 touchdowns, with 21 interceptions, while also rushing for 461 yards and 6 more scores. He is currently 9th all time in passing yards,<ref>{{cite web |title=NFL Passing Yards Career Leaders |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_career.htm |website=Pro Football Reference |access-date=26 August 2020}}</ref> 10th in passes completed,<ref>{{cite web |title=NFL Passes Completed Career Leaders |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_cmp_career.htm |website=Pro Football Reference |access-date=26 August 2020}}</ref> and 12th in passing touchdowns.<ref>{{cite web |title=NFL Passing Touchdowns Career Leaders |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career.htm |website=Pro Football Reference |access-date=26 August 2020}}</ref> His four total rushing touchdowns in his Super Bowl games are the most by a quarterback.
