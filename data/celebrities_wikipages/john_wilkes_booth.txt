Please do not unhide this without resolving all three of these major issues.\n\n===Evidence that shows Booth converted to Catholicism===\nThe editor's introduction of the 1874 memoir of Booth's sister [[Asia Booth|Asia Booth Clarke]] states that no individual church was preeminent in the Booth household during her childhood. Booth's mother was Episcopalian, and his father was described as a free spirit who was open to the great teachings of all religions.<ref name=Clarke42>Clarke, p. 16, 17</ref> On January 23, 1853, the 14-year-old Booth was [[Baptism|baptized]] at St. Timothy's [[Protestant Episcopal]] Church.<ref name=Clarke44 /> The Booth family had traditionally been Episcopalian. Clergyman [[Charles Chiniquy]] stated that Booth was a convert to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] later in life. Historian Constance Head also declared that Booth was of this religion. She wrote the paper \"Insights on John Wilkes Booth from His Sister Asia's Correspondence\" (1982) published in the ''Lincoln Herald'', in which she quotes from a letter of Booth's sister Asia Booth Clarke, in which she wrote that her brother was a Roman Catholic. (Asia Booth Clarke's memoir was published after her death.)\n\nTerry Alford, a college history professor and a leading authority on Booth's life,<ref name=Clarke43>Clarke, dust jacket, back inner sleeve</ref> has stated, \"Asia Booth Clarke's memoir of her brother John Wilkes Booth has been recognized as the single most important document available for understanding the personality of the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln\", and \"no outsider could give such insights into the turbulent Booth's childhood or share such unique personal knowledge of the gifted actor\". Testimony given at the trial of John Surratt showed that at his death, Booth had a Catholic medal on his person. Court evidence showed his attending a Roman Catholic church service on at least two occasions. Like his sister Asia, he received education at a school established by an official of the Catholic Church.\n\nConstance Head states, \"In any case, it seems certain that Booth did not publicize his conversion during his lifetime. And while there is no reasonable cause to connect Booth's religious preference and his 'mad act', the few who knew of his conversion must have decided after the assassination that for the good of the church, it was best never to mention it. Thus the secret remained so well guarded that even the most rabidly [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] writers who tried to depict the assassination of Lincoln as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] or [[Pope|Papist]] plot were puzzled by the seemingly accurate information that John Wilkes Booth was an Episcopalian.\"<ref name=Clarke542>Clarke, pp. 542, 543</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Constance|last=Head|title=Insights on John Wilkes Booth From His Sister Asia's Correspondence|newspaper=[[Lincoln Herald]]|publisher=Herald News|location=Lincolnton, North Carolina|date=Winter 1980|volume=82|issue=4|pages=542, 543}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Serup |title=Who Killed Abraham Lincoln?: An investigation of North America's most famous ex-priest's assertion that the Roman Catholic Church was behind the assassination of America's greatest President |publisher=[[Salmova Press]]|location=Prince George British Columbia, Canada|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-9811685-0-0|pages=144\u2013146, 382 }}</ref>--->\n\n==Theatrical career==\n===1850s===\n[[File:Richmond Theatre (VA) in 1858.jpg|thumb|The Richmond Theatre, [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1858, when Booth, who had started acting in 1855, made his first stage appearance there in the [[repertory company]]]]\nBooth made his stage debut at age 17 on August 14, 1855, in the supporting role of the Earl of Richmond in ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' at Baltimore's Charles Street Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ghostsofbaltimore.org/2013/09/09/original-ad-john-wilkes-booths-acting-debut/|title=Original Ad For John Wilkes Booth's Acting Debut|last=Tom|date=September 9, 2013|website=Ghosts of Baltimore|language=en-US|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Smith61>Smith, pp. 61\u201362.</ref><ref>Kauffman, ''American Brutus'', p. 95.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Original Ad for John Wilkes Booth's Acting Debut|date=September 9, 2013|url=http://ghostsofbaltimore.org/2013/09/09/original-ad-john-wilkes-booths-acting-debut/|publisher=Ghosts of Baltimore|access-date=September 9, 2013}}</ref> The audience jeered at him when he missed some of his lines.<ref name=Smith61 /><ref name=Bishop2>{{cite book|last=Bishop|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Bishop|title=The Day Lincoln Was Shot|url=https://archive.org/details/daylincolnwassho00bish|url-access=registration|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1955|pages=[https://archive.org/details/daylincolnwassho00bish/page/63 63\u201364]|lccn=54012170}}</ref> He also began acting at Baltimore's [[Holliday Street Theater]], owned by [[John T.
