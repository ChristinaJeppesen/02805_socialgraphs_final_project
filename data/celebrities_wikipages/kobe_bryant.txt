On January 22, 2006, he scored a career-high 81 points; the second [[List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders|most points scored in a single NBA game]], behind [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]]. Bryant led the team to consecutive championships in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], both times being named NBA Finals MVP. He continued to be among the top players in the league through the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]], when he suffered a [[torn achilles tendon]] at age 34. His next two seasons were cut short by injuries to his knee and shoulder, respectively. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]]. In 2017, the Lakers retired both his Nos. 8 and 24, making him the only player in NBA history to have multiple [[retired number|numbers retired]] by the same franchise.\n\nThe all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] in NBA history to [[List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders|play 20 seasons]]. His 18 All-Star designations are the [[List of NBA All-Stars|second most all time]], and he has the most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four [[NBA All-Star Game MVP Award]]s are tied with [[Bob Pettit]] for the most in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname \"'''Black Mamba'''\" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public.
