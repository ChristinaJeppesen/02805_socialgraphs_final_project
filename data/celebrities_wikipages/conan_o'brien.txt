He is best known for having hosted [[late-night talk shows]] for almost 28 years, beginning with ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' (1993\u20132009) and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' (2009\u20132010) on the [[NBC]] television network, and ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' (2010\u20132021) on the cable channel [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]]. Before his hosting career, he was a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (1988\u20131991) and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1991\u20131993). He has also been host of the podcast series ''[[Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend]]'' since 2018 and is expected to launch a new show on [[HBO Max]].\n\nBorn in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], O'Brien was raised in an [[Irish Catholic]] family. He served as president of ''[[The Harvard Lampoon]]'' while attending [[Harvard University]], and was a writer for the sketch comedy series ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]''. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of ''Saturday Night Live''. O'Brien was a writer and producer for ''The Simpsons'' for two seasons until he was selected by [[Lorne Michaels]] and [[NBC]] to take over [[David Letterman]]'s position as host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' in 1993. A virtual unknown to the public, O'Brien's initial ''Late Night'' tenure received unfavorable reviews and remained on a multiweek renewal cycle during its early years. The show generally improved over time and was highly regarded by the time of his departure in 2009. Afterwards, O'Brien moved from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of ''The Tonight Show'' for seven months until highly-publicized network politics [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|prompted a host change in 2010]]. After this departure, O'Brien hosted a 32-city live comedy tour titled [[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour]], which was the subject of the documentary ''[[Conan O'Brien Can't Stop]]''. He then hosted ''Conan'' from 2010 to 2021. Throughout his career he has also hosted a number of awards shows and [[television special]]s, including the [[Emmy Award]]s and the [[White House Correspondents' dinner]] twice each.<ref name=\"nytannouncement\">{{cite news |last1=Carter |first1=Bill |title=Conan O'Brien Will Do a Late-Night Show on TBS |url=https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/conan-obrien-will-do-a-late-night-show-on-tbs/ |access-date=May 10, 2022 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220428065355/https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/12/conan-obrien-will-do-a-late-night-show-on-tbs/ |archive-date=April 28, 2022}}</ref><ref name=\"abc04122010\">{{cite web |author=Moore |first=Frazier |date=April 12, 2010 |title=Conan O'Brien to make TBS his new late-night home |url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-conan-obrien-to-make-tbs-his-new-late-night-home-2010apr12-story.html#:~:text=The%20late%2Dnight%20guessing%20game,his%20employer%20of%2017%20years. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220518160045/https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-conan-obrien-to-make-tbs-his-new-late-night-home-2010apr12-story.html%23:~:text%3DThe%20late-night%20guessing%20game%2Chis%20employer%20of%2017%20years. |archive-date=May 18, 2022 |access-date=April 12, 2010 |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]}}</ref>\n\nKnown for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as \"awkward, self-deprecating humor\", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the \"lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films\".<ref name=\"NewYorkT\">{{cite news |last=Hirschberg |first=Lynn |date=May 20, 2009 |title=Heeeere's . . .
