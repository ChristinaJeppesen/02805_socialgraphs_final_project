A seven-time [[NASCAR Cup Series]] champion, he competed full-time in the series from 2002 to 2020, driving the No. 48 [[Chevrolet]] with [[Hendrick Motorsports]]. Johnson's seven Cup championships, the first five of which are consecutive, are tied with [[Richard Petty]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the most all-time. Many analysts and fellow drivers consider Johnson to be one of the greatest NASCAR drivers of all time. From 2021 to 2022, Johnson competed in the [[IndyCar Series]] for [[Chip Ganassi Racing]]. Johnson is also known for his appearances in [[sports car racing]], where he drives the No. 48 [[Cadillac DPi-V.R|Cadillac]] on a part-time schedule for [[Action Express Racing]].\n\nJohnson was born in [[El Cajon, California]], and began racing motorcycles at the age of four. After graduating from [[Granite Hills High School (El Cajon, California)|Granite Hills High School]] he competed in [[off-road racing|off-road]] series. He raced in [[Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group]] (MTEG), [[Short-course Off-road Drivers Association]] (SODA), and [[SCORE International]], winning rookie of the year in each series. In 1998, Johnson and his team, [[Herzog Motorsports]], began stock car racing. He moved to the national [[American Speed Association]] (ASA) series for [[late model]] touring cars, and won another rookie of the year title. In 2000, he switched to the NASCAR Busch Series (now [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Xfinity Series]]).\n\nHis talent was noticed by Hendrick Motorsports driver [[Jeff Gordon]], who convinced owner [[Rick Hendrick]] to sign Johnson in the Winston Cup Series full-time for 2002, with Gordon as a part-owner of his car. After finishing fifth in the points in his first full season, he was second in 2003 and 2004 and fifth in 2005. Johnson won his first Cup Series championship in 2006 and with further wins in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, he became the first and only driver in NASCAR history<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.carophile.org/greatest-race-car-drivers-of-all-time/6/|title = 10 Greatest Race Car Drivers of All Time - Page 6 of 10|date = May 7, 2015|access-date = April 8, 2017|archive-date = April 9, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170409021229/http://www.carophile.org/greatest-race-car-drivers-of-all-time/6/|url-status = live}}</ref> to win five consecutive championships. Johnson finished sixth in the points standings in the 2011 season and third in 2012 before winning his sixth championship in 2013. In 2016, Johnson won his seventh championship, tying Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most Cup Series championships of all time. Johnson is also a two-time winner of the [[Daytona 500]], winning in [[2006 Daytona 500|2006]] and [[2013 Daytona 500|2013]].

It was also the first time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.\n\nThe following week at Phoenix, Johnson started inside the top ten and finished second behind [[Carl Edwards]]. He followed this with a sixth-place finish at Las Vegas. At Bristol, he was running on the lead lap until a spin late-race forced him back to a 22nd-place finish. At Fontana, he struggled for most of the race, racing near the back of the pack, but salvaged a 12th-place finish. Johnson won his first pole position of the season at Martinsville and had the dominant car, leading 346 of 500 laps on the way to his eighth Martinsville race win. Johnson also assumed the point lead as well, which he held for the remainder of the regular season. Johnson's consistency was enough that there were points in the summer where he was more than a full two-race wins' worth of points ahead of [[Carl Edwards]] or [[Clint Bowyer]]. Afterward, Johnson finished sixth at Texas. At Kansas, he led nine laps and finished third behind [[Matt Kenseth]] and [[Kasey Kahne]]. Johnson finished 12th the following week at Richmond, allowing him to build even further on his point lead. At Talladega, he was the only driver besides [[Matt Kenseth]] to lead double-digit laps (16) and finished in fifth place. A fourth-place finish the following week at Darlington allowed Johnson to further solidify his point lead over Edwards.\n\nIn the [[2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race]], Johnson won his record fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop allowed him to start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later passed [[Kasey Kahne]] for the victory.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/jimmie-johnson-races-record-4th-035533465--nascar.html|title=Jimmie Johnson races to record 4th All-Star win|work=[[Yahoo!

He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track's 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the [[2013 Quicken Loans 400|Quicken Loans 400]] at Michigan, Johnson closed in on [[Greg Biffle]] for the lead with less than ten laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go.

Johnson led the most laps and almost won, but a slow final pit stop cost him the race to Newman. The following week at Pocono, Johnson won another pole position, setting another track qualifying record. He led 43 of the first 80 laps before he cut a right-front tire that knocked a spark plug loose and affected the handling of the car. Johnson's pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing the plug on the last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.\n\nReturning to Michigan, Johnson qualified third but crashed in happy hour, forcing him to a backup car and a 43rd starting spot. After running up to the lead through pit stop strategy, Johnson lost an engine on lap 55, relegating him to a 40th-place finish. This was followed by a streak of three poor finishes of 36th at Bristol, 28th at Atlanta, and 40th at Richmond due to crashes and mechanical failures.\n\nJohnson started the Chase seeded in second place. He started the Chase with a fifth-place finish at Chicago, followed by a fourth-place finish at New Hampshire. At Dover, Johnson led 243 laps and held off [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] over the last 25 laps to win his eighth race at the track, also redeeming himself for the restart line violation that had cost him a shot at winning the June race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2013/09/29/Jimmie-Johnson-wins-record-eighth-victory-at-Dover|title=Jimmie Johnson wins record eighth victory at Dover|work=[[Hendrick Motorsports]]|date=September 29, 2013|access-date=September 30, 2013|archive-date=September 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929214923/http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/article/2013/09/29/Jimmie-Johnson-wins-record-eighth-victory-at-Dover|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJohnson spent the next several races chasing [[Matt Kenseth]] for the points lead, eventually gaining it at Talladega, though losing it when he and Kenseth tied for the points lead at Martinsville. Returning to Texas, Johnson had the dominant car, leading 255 laps to his sixth win of the season. The following weekend at Phoenix, Johnson avoided trouble in tight racing on two separate occasions (a near scrape in turn 4 on the first lap, and later a near spin after contact with [[Carl Edwards]] in turn 1) to escape with a third-place finish. He also capitalized on Kenseth suffering from a poor-handling car. With Kenseth finishing 23rd, Johnson took a 28-point lead to the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In the finale, Johnson raced conservatively to a ninth-place finish to secure his sixth title. He closed out the season with six wins, three poles, 16 top-five, and 24 top-ten finishes, with an average finish of 9.8 and an average start of 10.7.\n\n====2014====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson Sonoma 2014.jpg|thumb|Johnson racing during the [[2014 Toyota/Save Mart 350]]]]\nStatistically, 2014 was one of Johnson's worst seasons to date. He started the season on an up-and-down note but went winless through the first 11 races of the 2014 season (his best finish was 2nd at Martinsville). Skepticism began to arise, as he had never gone more than 12 races into a season without a win, and hadn't gone that long since the first few years of his Cup career. However, Johnson won the Coca-Cola 600, his first win in the race since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/10984179/jimmie-johnson-wins-coca-cola-600-first-victory-season|title=Jimmie Johnson wins Coca-Cola 600|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 26, 2014|access-date=June 4, 2020|archive-date=June 4, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200604162413/https://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/10984179/jimmie-johnson-wins-coca-cola-600-first-victory-season|url-status=live}}</ref> Afterward, he went on to win at Dover the following week, making it the 13th time he had back-to-back wins.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/06/01/jimmie-johnson-wins-dover-race-fedex-400-nascar-sprint-cup/9844103/|title=Jimmie Johnson makes it nine wins at Dover|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=June 1, 2014|access-date=June 1, 2014|archive-date=June 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602044150/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/06/01/jimmie-johnson-wins-dover-race-fedex-400-nascar-sprint-cup/9844103/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA few weeks later, Johnson recorded his first win at Michigan, after several years of being deprived of a shot at victory as the result of running out of gas or blowing an engine. However, he didn't keep up with the momentum. After finishing in the top ten at Sonoma and Kentucky, Johnson was collected in an early wreck in the Coke Zero 400, finishing 42nd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/motorracing/os-nascar-daytona-coke-notes-0707-20140706,0,343580.story|title=Jimmie Johnson falls from No. 2 in NASCAR Cup Series points standings.|access-date=July 7, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714224048/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/motorracing/os-nascar-daytona-coke-notes-0707-20140706,0,343580.story|archive-date=July 14, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Johnson's streak of misfortune continued the next several weeks, finishing 42nd for the second week in a row at New Hampshire. This was followed up by an inconsistent run at Indy (14th), and poor showings resulting from accidents at Pocono (39th) and Watkins Glen (28th). Despite the poor finishes, Johnson qualified fourth for the Chase.\n\nIn the Chase, Johnson finished 12th at Chicagoland, fifth at New Hampshire, and third at Dover to advance to the Contender Round. However, trouble struck when he finished 40th and 17th in the next two races.\n\nAt Talladega, Johnson started second and led a high of 84 laps. However, a 24th-place finish kept him from advancing to the Eliminator Round. At Martinsville, Johnson started seventh but finished 39th after being involved in a crash early in the race. Returning to Texas, Johnson dominated and held off [[Brad Keselowski]], [[Kevin Harvick]] (and [[Jeff Gordon]], who cut a tire on contact with Brad Keselowski late in the race which led to a post-race brawl) to score his third straight win in the fall Texas race, and also ended an 18-race-winless-streak. At Phoenix, he struggled for most of the day and finished 38th after blowing a tire and crashing out. At the season finale at Homestead, Johnson finished ninth and closed out finishing 11th in points. This marks the first time in Johnson's NASCAR Cup career that he has finished outside of the top ten in the final points.\n\n====2015====\n[[File:Three-wide multiple row back.JPG|thumb|right|Johnson leading the [[2015 Daytona 500]].]]\nJohnson began his season with a win in the [[Budweiser Duel]].

He rebounded with an 11th-place finish in Phoenix and a ninth-place finish at California, his first top ten there in two years. At Martinsville, he struggled to a 35th-place finish. However, his momentum returned at Texas when he held off [[Kevin Harvick]] and [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] to win. At Bristol, he avoided tight trouble early in the race and came home second to polesitter [[Matt Kenseth]]. At Richmond, he finished third. These finishes moved him back up to fourth in the standings. At Talladega, Johnson started fifth and led 50 laps, only to finish second to Earnhardt Jr.\n\nAt Kansas, Johnson gambled by staying out on the last round of pit stops and held off Harvick and Earnhardt again to win his third race at Kansas and of the season. In winning, he established a Cup record of 23 wins on 1.5-mile tracks, taking what was both his 200th top-five and his 300th top ten finish.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bonkowski|first1=Jerry|title=Jimmie Johnson leads Hendrick onslaught, holds off Kevin Harvick to win at Kansas|url=http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/10/jimmie-johnson-leads-hendrick-onslaught-holds-off-harvick-to-win-at-kansas/|website=NASCAR Talk|publisher=NBC Sports|access-date=May 10, 2015|date=May 10, 2015|archive-date=May 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511221852/http://nascartalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/10/jimmie-johnson-leads-hendrick-onslaught-holds-off-harvick-to-win-at-kansas/|url-status=live}}</ref> At Charlotte, he spun out on two occasions.

He wasn't so lucky on the second spin late in the race; while running fifth, he spun out again at the same place, and hit the wall in pit road, causing some nose damage. Those spin-outs left him with a 40th-place finish. He rebounded the following week with a [[2015 FedEx 400|win at Dover]], and also became one of four drivers to have won 10 or more races at one track. This gave him a total of 74 career wins, two fewer than [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s 76.\n\nAt Pocono, Johnson cut a tire on lap 88 but did not take major damage. He was able to work his way through the field to finish in third place. He finished 19th at Michigan after the race was called for rain on lap 138. At Sonoma, Johnson led the most laps at 45 laps, but a late-race caution caused by [[Casey Mears]]' broken wheel axle cost him, and he was passed by [[Kyle Busch]] with five laps to go and slipped back to sixth place.\n[[File:TSM350 - 2015 - Jimmie Johnson 2 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Johnson during [[2015 Toyota/Save Mart 350]] qualifying]]\nReturning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before finishing second to [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], in a repeat of the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the top ten for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr, took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished 3rd, Dale Jr. took 4th, Johnson grabbed 6th). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: Overshooting the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26\u201328): Speeding through pit road) Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn't so lucky at Michigan, late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th but had bad luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the 7th caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th. He was able to recover a bit for a 9th-place finish at Richmond and started 1st in the Chase in a three-way tie between him, Kyle Busch, and Matt Kenseth.\n\nJohnson opened up the Chase in a rough way. At Chicagoland, he blew a left front tire early in the race but was able to charge through the field to salvage an 11th-place finish. He also was the subject of controversy when he made contact with [[Kevin Harvick]] on a three-wide pass that led to Harvick cutting a left rear tire, leaving Harvick with a 42nd-place finish.\n\nAt Loudon, Johnson finished 6th after blowing a tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes came to an end when his car broke a driveline, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.\n\nJohnson finished 5th at Phoenix, and for the third year in a row, he finished 9th at Homestead. Also in the process, he edged out Ryan Newman by 1 point to finish 10th in the final standings. With the retirement of his teammate and mentor, Jeff Gordon, Johnson assumed the active wins record with 75.\n\n====2016: The seventh title====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson 2016 Cup Series Champion.jpg|thumb|Johnson after winning the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Championship]]\nJohnson began the 2016 season with a 16th-place finish at the [[2016 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]].

At Richmond, he led 44 laps early in the race and finished 3rd. At [[2016 GEICO 500|Talladega]], Johnson was spun by [[Paul Menard]] and got involved in a multi-car accident with 28 laps to go, finishing 22nd. Johnson's streak of misfortune continued through the next several months, crashing out at [[2016 AAA 400 Drive for Autism|Dover]], [[2016 Axalta \"We Paint Winners\" 400|Pocono]], [[2016 Coke Zero 400|Daytona]], Kentucky and at Watkins Glen, where he finished last for the first time in his career. His top-10 finishes during the period came only in the [[2016 Coca-Cola 600|Coca-Cola 600]] and [[2016 Brickyard 400|Brickyard 400]], where he finished 3rd in both races. Johnson finished 7th and 6th at Bristol and Michigan the following two weeks but finished 33rd at Darlington after he spun out of turn 4. Johnson then finished 11th at Richmond. He qualified 8th for the Chase.\n\nJohnson began the [[NASCAR Chase for the Championship|Chase for the Championship]] by leading a race-high 118 laps at Chicagoland, but received a speeding penalty during a green flag pit stop late in the race, ultimately finished 12th. Johnson finished 8th the following week at Loudon. At [[2016 Citizen Soldier 400|Dover]], Johnson led 90 laps but once again received a pit road penalty with 105 laps to go, costing him a win. He charged through the field and finished 7th (1st car a lap down) and moved to the \"Round of 12\" of the Chase.\n\nAt Charlotte, Johnson led a race-high 155 laps and won the [[2016 Bank of America 500|Bank of America 500]], claiming his 8th win at the track and the 3rd win of the season, also snapping his 24-race winless streak. This marked Johnson's first appearance in the \"Round of 8\" under the current Chase system. He then finished 4th at Kansas and 23rd at [[2016 Hellmann's 500|Talladega]]. At Martinsville, [[Denny Hamlin]] aggressively made contact with Johnson on lap 198 and had a tire rub to cause a caution but was able to stay on the lead lap. Later during a caution on lap 362, he lost fuel pressure but was able to get the car refired and stayed on the lead lap again. After the restart, he took the lead from Hamlin and led the final 92 laps to win the [[2016 Goody's Fast Relief 500|Goody's Fast Relief 500]]. This locked him into the Championship 4 for the final race at Homestead. Johnson finished 11th in the rain-shortened race at [[2016 AAA Texas 500|Texas]], and 38th at [[2016 Can-Am 500|Phoenix]] after being penalized a lap for passing the pace car coming down to pit road and involved in a wreck on a restart.\n\n{{Wikinews|Jimmie Johnson wins seventh NASCAR Cup Series championship}}\nJohnson claimed his seventh championship by winning at [[2016 Ford EcoBoost 400|Homestead]] on November 20. After losing his starting spot due to a pre-race inspection fault, Johnson started at the rear of the field. He progressed through the field, cracking the top 10 quickly, but remained stagnant around 5th place for a majority of the race. On a restart with 10 laps to go, [[Carl Edwards]] came across the nose of Joey Logano, hit the inside wall, and triggered a massive wreck, ending Edwards' championship hopes. Johnson avoided the accident and was put into the position to win the title. On the final restart, he passed [[Kyle Larson]], winning the race and his seventh championship, tying [[Richard Petty]] and [[Dale Earnhardt]] for the most all-time of championships.\n\n====2017: Final NASCAR wins====\n[[File:Jimmie Johnson Dover 2017.jpg|thumb|Johnson before winning his final race, the [[2017 AAA 400 Drive for Autism]]]]\nJohnson came into 2017 as the defending NASCAR Cup Series champion. The start of the season didn't go as smoothly as the end of last season, however. Through the first six races of the season, Johnson only scored one top ten finish. He then rebounded with back-to-back wins at the [[2017 O'Reilly Auto Parts 500]] in Texas (started from the rear of the field) and the [[2017 Food City 500]] at Bristol, his first win at The Last Great Coliseum since 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2017/04/24/jimmie-johnson-wins-2nd-race-in-a-row-captures-food-city-500-at-bristol/|title = Jimmie Johnson wins second race in a row, captures Food City 500 at Bristol|date = April 24, 2017}}</ref> This would be the 14th and final time he won back-to-back races in his career.

In the week following his Dover triumph, during the [[2017 Axalta presents the Pocono 400|Axalta presents the Pocono 400]], Johnson's brakes failed into Turn 1 at a speed of over 200 MPH, resulting in a tremendous impact with the outside [[SAFER barrier]]. Similarly, directly behind Johnson, fellow competitor [[Jamie McMurray]] also experienced a brake failure, and impacted the wall hard, igniting a large vehicle fire.

During that stretch, in the [[2017 Brickyard 400]] on a late race restart, Johnson's Lowe's Chevrolet started billowing smoke while running in the 3rd position. Heading into Turn 3, the two race leaders Brad Keselowski and Kasey Kahne battled one another, allowing Johnson to close in and make a 3 wide move to the inside. Without much space into the corner, and with the obvious mechanical failure, the car broke sideways and impacted the outside retaining wall hard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2017/07/23/add-jimmie-johnson-to-those-who-wreck-out-of-brickyard-400/|title = Add Jimmie Johnson to those who wreck out of Brickyard 400|date = July 24, 2017}}</ref> The following week, Johnson had another run-in with teammate Kasey Kahne, resulting in a second consecutive DNF; his third in the last four races.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/watch-jimmie-johnson-crashes-out-of-nascar-race-at-pocono/|title = WATCH: Jimmie Johnson crashes out of NASCAR race at Pocono}}</ref> Regardless, Johnson (from his wins earlier in the season) was able to qualify for the playoffs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/09/09/2017-nascar-playoffs-drivers-monster-energy-series/|title = NASCAR Playoffs: 2017 Monster Energy Series field set|date = September 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nEntering the 2017 NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs, the defending champion was still one of the favorites to win the title, despite his results over the summer stretch.

In the elimination race at Kansas Speedway, Johnson entered with a 7-point advantage. After having two separate spins, he drove his way through a large multicar accident off turn 2, involving Playoff drivers Matt Kenseth and Jamie McMurray, and rebounded with an 11th-place finish.

At the [[2018 Advance Auto Parts Clash|Advance Auto Parts Clash]], he was wrecked on the last lap by [[Kyle Larson]]; this was the seventh year in a row he failed to finish the Clash. Johnson qualified third for the [[2018 Daytona 500]] but had to go to a backup car after wrecking in his [[2018 Can-Am Duels|Duel]]. On lap 59 of the Daytona 500, he got caught up in a wreck started by [[Ryan Blaney]], and [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]], which also involved his teammate [[William Byron (racing driver)|William Byron]], [[Erik Jones]], [[Daniel Su\u00e1rez]], [[Trevor Bayne]], and [[Ty Dillon]] and ended up 38th. Since then, Johnson struggled throughout the 2018 season with only two top-fives and eight top-10 finishes by the time he barely made the Playoffs for the 15th season in a row. Johnson's only great run of the season came at the [[2018 Bank of America Roval 400|Charlotte Roval race]] where he ran in the Top 10 for most of the day and battled [[Martin Truex Jr.]] for the win on the final lap, but he locked his brakes on turn 17 and spun out of control, taking Truex out with him in the process while Blaney passed them to win the race. Johnson finished eighth, and as a result of a three-way tie with 0 points, he was eliminated in the Round of 16. Johnson scored only one more top-ten finish afterward and wound up a then career-worst 14th in the final point standings since running full-time in 2002, winless for the first time in his career along with equaling a career-low 11 top-ten finishes for the second season in a row.\n\nJohnson notably gave teammate and friend Chase Elliott a push to the front stretch when his car ran out of fuel when being congratulated by the rest of the drivers after recording his first career win, at Watkins Glen.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Iconic moment as Johnson pushes Elliott to Victory Lane {{!}} Hendrick Motorsports|url=http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/articles/92067/iconic-moment-as-johnson-pushes-elliott-to-victory-lane|access-date=2020-07-19|website=hendrickmotorsports.com|archive-date=July 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719163357/http://www.hendrickmotorsports.com/news/articles/92067/iconic-moment-as-johnson-pushes-elliott-to-victory-lane|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-08-08|title=Chase Elliott on Jimmie Johnson's 'awesome' sportsmanship after first win|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/08/chase-elliott-jimmie-johnson-nascar-first-win-teammate-sportsmanship-celebration-watkins-glen-hendrick|access-date=2020-07-19|website=For The Win|language=en|archive-date=July 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719035526/https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/08/chase-elliott-jimmie-johnson-nascar-first-win-teammate-sportsmanship-celebration-watkins-glen-hendrick|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Lowe's announced they would no longer sponsor the No. 48 car after the 2018 season; [[Ally Financial]] assumed primary sponsorship of the team in 2019 on a two-year deal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/jimmie-johnson-sponsor-ally-financial-lowes/3204616/ | title=Jimmie Johnson finds new sponsor in Ally Financial for 2019 season | last=Utter | first=Jim | work=Motorsport.com | date=October 29, 2018 | access-date=October 29, 2018 | archive-date=October 28, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028230005/https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/jimmie-johnson-sponsor-ally-financial-lowes/3204616/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Johnson and his long-time crew chief Knaus parted ways at the end of the season, ending a 17-year partnership, the longest in NASCAR history.
