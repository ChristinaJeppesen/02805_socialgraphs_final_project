R. M. Howard]], a 1950s proponent of the consumer boycott tactic, soon became a major supporter of Jackson's efforts \u2013 donating and raising funds, and introducing Jackson to prominent members of the black business community in Chicago.<ref name=\"maverick\"/> Under Jackson's direction, Operation Breadbasket held popular weekly workshops on Chicago's South Side featuring white and black political and economic leaders,<ref name=\"quits\"/> and religious services complete with a jazz band and choir.<ref name=\"chicago's\"/>\n\nJackson became involved in SCLC leadership disputes following King's assassination on April 4, 1968. When King was shot, Jackson was in the parking lot one floor below.<ref name=\"aims\"/> Jackson told reporters he was the last person to speak to King, and that King died in his arms \u2013 an account that several King aides disputed.<ref name=\"aims\"/> In the wake of King's death, Jackson worked on SCLC's [[Poor People's Campaign|Poor People's Crusade]] in Washington, D.C., and was credited with managing its 15-acre tent city \u2013 but he began to increasingly clash with [[Ralph Abernathy]], King's successor as chairman of the SCLC.<ref name=\"chief\"/><ref name=\"shanty\"/> In 1969 ''The New York Times'' reported that several black leaders viewed Jackson as King's successor and that Jackson was one of the few black activists who was preaching racial reconciliation.\n\nJackson was also reportedly seeking coalition with whites in order to approach what were considered racial problems as economic and class problems. \"When we change the race problem into a class fight between the haves and the have-nots, then we are going to have a new ball game\", he said.<ref name=\"chicago's\"/> In the 21st century, some public school systems are working on an approach for affirmative action that deals with family income rather than race, recognizing that some minority members have been very successful. ''The Times'' also indicated that Jackson was being criticized as too involved with middle-class blacks, and for having an unattainable goal of racial unity.<ref name=\"chicago's\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1971 Abernathy ordered Jackson to move the national office of Operation Breadbasket from Chicago to Atlanta and sought to place another person in charge of local Chicago activities, but Jackson refused to move.<ref name=\"quits\"/> He organized the October 1971 Black Expo in Chicago, a trade and business fair to promote black capitalism and grass roots political power.<ref name=\"races\"/> The five-day event was attended by black businessmen from 40 states, as well as politicians such as Cleveland Mayor [[Carl Stokes]], and Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]. Daley's presence was seen as a testament to the growing political and economic power of blacks.<ref name=\"races\"/>\n\nIn December 1971 Jackson and Abernathy had a complete falling out, with the split described as part of a leadership struggle between Jackson, who had a national profile, and Abernathy, whose prominence from the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was beginning to wane.<ref name=\"quits\"/> The break began when Abernathy questioned the handling of receipts from the Black Expo, and then suspended Jackson as leader of Operation Breadbasket for not obtaining permission to form non-profit corporations.<ref name=\"quits\"/> [[Al Sharpton]], then youth group leader of the SCLC, left the organization to protest Jackson's treatment and formed the [[National Youth Movement]].<ref name=DS/> Jackson, his entire Breadbasket staff, and 30 of the 35 board members resigned from the SCLC and began planning a new organization.<ref name=\"search\"/><ref name=\"races2\"/> ''Time'' magazine quoted Jackson as saying at that time that the traditional civil rights movement had lost its \"offensive thrust.\"<ref name=\"races2\"/>\n\n===Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}\n[[File:20070906 Rainbow-PUSH Headquarters.JPG|thumb|The [[Rainbow/PUSH]] national headquarters in [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]], Chicago]]\n[[People United to Save Humanity]] (Operation PUSH) officially began operations on December 25, 1971;<ref name=\"races2\"/> Jackson later changed the name to People United to Serve Humanity.<ref name=\"clearing\"/> T.

The Republican Party needs black people if it is ever to compete for national office.\"<ref name=\"wooing\"/>\n\nIn 1983 Jackson and Operation PUSH led a boycott against beer giant [[Anheuser-Busch]], criticizing the company's level of minority employment in their distribution network. [[August Busch IV]], Anheuser-Busch's CEO was introduced in 1996 to Yusef Jackson, Jesse's son, by Jackson family friend [[Ron Burkle]]. In 1998 Yusef and his brother Jonathan were chosen by Anheuser-Busch to head River North Sales, a Chicago beer distribution company, leading to controversy. \"There is no causal connection between the boycott in 1983 and me meeting in the middle '90s and me buying this company in 1998,\" said Yusef.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jackson|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20051015/ISSUE02/100024624/jackson|work=Crain's Chicago Business|date=October 15, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Jackson Contacts Cultivated Beer Deal|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-08/news/0104080240_1_yusef-jackson-rev-jackson-jackson-sons|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|date=April 8, 2001|first=Sabrina L. |last=Miller |author2= E.A.

In 1983 he traveled to [[Syria]] to secure the release of a captured American pilot, Navy Lt. [[Robert Goodman]], who was being held by the Syrian government. Goodman had been shot down over Lebanon while on a mission to bomb Syrian positions in that country. After Jackson made a dramatic personal appeal to [[List of Presidents of Syria|Syrian President]] [[Hafez al-Assad]], Goodman was released. The Reagan administration was initially skeptical about Jackson's trip, but after Jackson secured Goodman's release, Reagan welcomed Jackson and Goodman to the White House on January 4, 1984.<ref name=\"damascus\"/> This helped to boost Jackson's popularity as an American patriot and served as a springboard for his 1984 presidential run. In June 1984 Jackson negotiated the release of 22 Americans being held in [[Cuba]] after an invitation by Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]].<ref name=\"times topics\"/>\n\nOn the eve of the 1991 Persian [[Gulf War]], Jackson made a trip to Iraq to plead with [[Saddam Hussein]] for the release of foreign nationals held there as a \"human shield\", securing the release of several British and 20 American individuals.<ref name=\"reunites\"/><ref name=\"pilgrimage\"/><ref name=\"politics\"/>\n\nIn 1997 Jackson traveled to [[Kenya]] to meet with [[Heads of state of Kenya|Kenyan President]] [[Daniel arap Moi]] as United States President [[Bill Clinton]]'s special envoy for democracy to promote free and fair elections. In April 1999, during the [[Kosovo War]], he traveled to [[Belgrade]] to negotiate the release of three U.S. POWs captured on the [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] border while patrolling with a UN peacekeeping unit. He met with then-Yugoslav president [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], who later agreed to release the three men.<ref name=\"frontline\"/>\n\nHis international efforts continued into the 2000s. On February 15, 2003, Jackson spoke in front of over an estimated one million people in [[Hyde Park, London]] at the culmination of the [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|anti-war demonstration]] against the imminent [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of [[Iraq]] by the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In November 2004 Jackson visited senior politicians and community activists in [[Northern Ireland]] in an effort to encourage better cross-community relations and rebuild the peace process and restore the governmental institutions of the [[Belfast Agreement]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}\n\nIn August 2005 Jackson traveled to [[Venezuela]] to meet [[List of Presidents of Venezuela|Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], following controversial remarks by televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] that implied that Ch\u00e1vez should be assassinated. Jackson condemned Robertson's remarks as immoral. After meeting with Ch\u00e1vez and addressing the Venezuelan Parliament, Jackson said there was no evidence that Venezuela posed a threat to the U.S. He also met representatives from the Venezuelan African and indigenous communities.<ref name=\"venezuela\"/>{{better source needed|not RS per RSP|date=June 2022}}\n\nIn 2005 Jackson was enlisted as part of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Operation Black Vote]], a campaign [[Simon Woolley]] ran to encourage more of Britain's ethnic minorities to vote in political elections ahead of the [[May 2005 General Election]].<ref name=\"black vote\"/>\n\nIn 2009 Jackson served as a speaker for the [[International Peace Foundation]] on the topic \"Building a culture of peace and development in a globalized world\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peace-foundation.net/speaker_previous.asp |title=International Peace Foundation - Previous speakers and artists |date=2007 |access-date=August 12, 2017}}</ref> He visited multiple locations in Malaysia, including the [[Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations]] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in [[Thailand]], including [[NIST International School]] in Bangkok.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zenfolio.nist.ac.th/p431554045 |title=2009-04-23: Bridges - Rev.

He afterwards stated that he had been handicapped by party rules. While Mondale (in the words of his aides) was determined to establish a precedent with his vice presidential candidate by picking a woman or visible minority, Jackson criticized the screening process as a \"[[Public relations|p.r.]] parade of personalities\". He also mocked Mondale, saying that [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the \"last significant politician out of the St. Paul\u2013Minneapolis\" area.<ref name=\"trying\"/>\n\n===Relations with Jewish community===\nJackson was criticized in the early 1980s for referring to Jews as \"Hymies\" and New York City as \"Hymietown\" in remarks to a black ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter.<ref name=\"aims\"/><ref name=wapo/> (\"[[List of religious slurs|Hymie]]\" is a [[pejorative]] term for [[Jew]]s.)

A rift between Jackson and many in the Jewish community endured at least through the 1990s.<ref name=wapo />\n\nShortly after President [[Jimmy Carter]] fired U.N. Ambassador [[Andrew Young]] for meeting with [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] representatives, Jackson and other black leaders began publicly endorsing a Palestinian state, with Jackson calling Israel's prime minister a \"terrorist\" and soliciting Arab-American financial support.<ref name=\"'70s 273\"/> Jackson has since apologized for some of these remarks, but they badly damaged his presidential campaign, as \"Jackson was seen by many conservatives in the United States as hostile to Israel and far too close to Arab governments.\"<ref name=LibyaSalon/>\n\nAccording to a 1987 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, Jackson began attempting to improve his relationship with the Jewish community after 1984.<ref name=\"aims\"/> In 2000, he was invited to speak in support of [[Jewish]] Senator and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] candidate [[Joe Lieberman]] at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"don't ask\"/>\n\nOn March 8, 2020, Jackson endorsed Jewish candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] for president.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/486484-civil-rights-activist-jesse-jackson-endorses-sanders |title = Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson endorses Sanders|website=The Hill|first=Justine|last=Coleman |date = March 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===1988 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Jesse Jackson presidential campaign, 1988}}\nIn 1988 Jackson again sought the Democratic presidential nomination.

In his speech he spoke out against Chrysler's decision: \"We have to put the focus on Kenosha, Wisconsin, as the place, here and now, where we draw the line to end economic violence!\" He compared the workers' fight to that of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|1965 Voting Rights Movement]] in [[Selma, Alabama]]. As a result, the UAW Local 72 union voted to endorse Jackson, even against UAW rules.<ref name=dudley/>\n\nAfter winning 55% of the vote in the [[Michigan]] Democratic caucus, Jackson was considered the front-runner for the nomination, as he surpassed all the other candidates in total number of pledged [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s. But Jackson's campaign suffered a significant setback less than two weeks after the UAW endorsement when he narrowly lost the Colorado primary to [[Michael Dukakis]] and was defeated handily the following day by Dukakis in the [[Wisconsin]] primary. Jackson's showing among white voters in Wisconsin was significantly better than in 1984, but was also noticeably lower than pre-primary polling had predicted.

In 1987 ''The New York Times'' described him as \"a classic liberal in the tradition of the New Deal and the Great Society\".<ref name=\"aims\"/> Declaring that he wanted to create a \"Rainbow Coalition\" of various [[minority group|minority]] groups, including [[African American]]s, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]], [[Arab-American]]s, [[Asian American]]s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[family farm]]ers, the [[Poverty|poor]] and [[working class]], and [[homosexuality|homosexuals]], as well as [[European American]] [[progressivism|progressives]] who fit into none of those categories, Jackson ran on a platform that included:\n* Creating a [[Works Progress Administration]]-style program to rebuild America's [[infrastructure]] and provide jobs to all Americans,\n* Re-prioritizing the [[War on Drugs]] to focus less on [[mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for drug users (which he views as racially biased) and more on harsher punishments for [[money-laundering]] [[banker]]s and others who are part of the \"supply\" end of \"[[supply and demand]]\"\n* Reversing [[Reaganomics]]-inspired [[tax cuts]] for the richest ten percent of Americans and using the money to finance [[social welfare]] programs\n* Cutting the [[budget]] of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] by as much as fifteen percent over the course of his administration\n* Declaring [[Apartheid]]-era South Africa to be a [[Rogue state|rogue nation]]\n* Instituting an immediate [[nuclear freeze]] and beginning [[disarmament]] negotiations with the [[Soviet Union]]\n* Supporting family farmers by reviving many of [[Franklin D.

Less than a month after the 1973 Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' legalized abortion, Jackson began a PUSH campaign against the decision, calling abortion murder and declaring that [[Jesus]] and [[Moses]] might not have been born if abortion had been available in ancient times.<ref name=\"maverick\"/> Jackson's strong rhetoric on abortion temporarily alienated one of his major supporters, T. R. M. Howard, a Black physician who performed the procedure.<ref name=\"maverick\"/>\n\nIn 1975, Jackson endorsed a plan for a constitutional amendment banning abortion.<ref name=\"christians join\"/> He also endorsed the [[Hyde Amendment]], which bars the funding of abortions through the federal [[Medicaid]] program. In a 1977 [[National Right to Life Committee]] News report, Jackson argued that the basis for ''Roe v. Wade'' \u2013 the [[right to privacy]] \u2013 had also been used to justify slavery and the treatment of slaves on the plantations. Jackson decried what he believed was the casual taking of life and the decline in society's values. Jackson later changed his views, saying that women have the right to an abortion and that the government should not interfere.<ref name=\"reprint\"/>\n\n===Later political activities===\n\n====1990s====\n[[File:Barlow-and-jesse-jackson.jpg|thumb|200px|Jackson with [[Maude Barlow]]]]\nJackson ran for office as \"[[shadow senator]]\" for the District of Columbia when the position was created in 1991<ref name=\"to run\"/> serving as such through 1997, when he did not run for reelection.

The incident was caught on home video and became a national media event when CNN ran pictures of the fight. After the students were expelled, Jackson argued that the expulsions were unfair and racially biased. He called on the school board to reverse its decision.<ref name=\"national race\"/>\n\n====2000s====\nOn January 20, 2001, Bill Clinton's final day in office, Clinton pardoned Congressman [[Mel Reynolds]], John Bustamante, and Dorothy Rivers; Jackson had requested pardons for them. Jackson had also requested a pardon for his half-brother Noah Robinson who had been convicted of murdering Leroy Barber and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Clinton did not pardon Robinson on the grounds that Robinson had already submitted three pardon appeals, all of which the Justice Department had denied.<ref>Timmerman, Kenneth, \"Shakedown, Exposing the Jesse Jackson Racket\"</ref>\n\nJackson was a target of a [[2002 white supremacist terror plot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/07/26/Jury-convicts-white-supremacists/UPI-67151027718854/|title=Jury convicts white supremacists|author=Haskell, Dave|date=July 26, 2002|work=[[United Press International]]|access-date=January 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:March3.J27.UFPJ.WDC.27jan07.jpg|thumb|Jackson at an [[January 27, 2007 anti-war protest|anti-war rally]] in 2007 with [[Sean Penn]]]]\n\nIn early 2005 Jackson visited [[Terri Schiavo]]'s parents and supported their unsuccessful bid to keep her alive.<ref name=\"schiavo\"/>\n\nIn 2005 the [[Federal Election Commission]] ruled that Jackson and the [[Democratic National Committee]] had violated electoral law and levied a $200,000 fine on them.<ref>{{cite news|title=Democrats, Jackson fined $200,000 by FEC|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-27/news/0505270241_1_campaign-travel-arrangement-citizen-education-fund-democratic-committee|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|language=en|date=May 27, 2005|first=Rudolph|last=Bush}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006 an African-American woman accused three white members of the [[Duke University]] men's lacrosse team of raping her.

The case against the three men was later thrown out and the players were declared innocent by the North Carolina Attorney General.<ref name=\"prosecutors\"/>\n\nJackson took a key role in the scandal caused by comedian [[Michael Richards]]'s onstage racist tirade at the [[Laugh Factory]] in November 2006. Richards called Jackson a few days after [[Michael Richards#2006 Laugh Factory incident|the incident]] to apologize; Jackson accepted Richards' apology<ref name=\"comedian's\"/> and met with him publicly as a means of resolving the situation. Jackson also joined Black leaders in a call for the elimination of the \"[[nigger|N-word]]\" throughout the entertainment industry.<ref name=\"richards\"/>\n\nOn June 23, 2007, Jackson was arrested in connection with a protest at a gun store in Riverdale, a low-income suburb of Chicago. He and others were protesting due to allegations that the gun store had been selling firearms to local gang members and was contributing to the decay of the community. According to police reports, Jackson refused to stop blocking the front entrance of the store and let customers pass. He was charged with one count of criminal trespassing.<ref name=\"arrested\"/>\n\nIn March 2007 Jackson declared his support for then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries]].<ref name=\"backs obama\"/> He later criticized Obama in 2007 for \"[[acting white|acting like he's white]]\" in response to the [[Jena 6]] beating case.<ref name=\"jena 6\"/>\n\nOn July 6, 2008, during an interview with [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]], a microphone picked up Jackson whispering to fellow guest Reed Tuckson:<ref name=\"regrets\"/> \"See, Barack's been, ahh, talking down to black people on this faith-based...
