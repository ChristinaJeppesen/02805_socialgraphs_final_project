While Obama toiled unknown in Illinois, the Bronx-born Spitzer won himself a national reputation as the \"Sheriff of Wall Street\". He was New York's tough-talking attorney-general, who fought banking corruption, enforced environment law and won rights for low-paid workers. He used that fame to enter politics and in 2006 became governor of New York: a perfect springboard for the White House. Before America fell in love with its first black president, people wondered if it was willing to embrace its first Jewish one. Spitzer could have made history.<br/><br/>Instead he left office in disgrace three years ago amid a flood of tabloid headlines that recounted salacious details from his repeated use of a high-end escort service. Spitzer was dubbed the \"Luv Guv\" and forced into a political wilderness. Rarely in American politics was a fall from grace so spectacular, so complete and so clearly down to a self-inflicted human flaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/27/eliot-spitzer-wall-street-fallen-angel|title=Eliot Spitzer: Wall Street's fallen angel|first=Paul|last=Harris|date=February 27, 2011|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Prostitution scandal developments===\nOn July 16, 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article that explained how Spitzer used campaign funds to pay for two [[Mayflower Hotel]] bookings, $411.06 apiece, where he was alleged to have met with prostitutes.
