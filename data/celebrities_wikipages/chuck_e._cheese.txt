Cheese's Pizza''' and simply '''Chuck E. Cheese's''') is an American [[family entertainment center]] and pizza restaurant chain founded in 1977 by [[Atari]]'s co-founder [[Nolan Bushnell]]. Headquartered in [[Irving, Texas]], each location features [[arcade game]]s, [[amusement ride]]s, and character stage shows in addition to serving [[pizza]] and other food items; former mainstays included [[Ball pits|ball pits]], crawl tubes, and [[Animatronics|animatronic]] shows. The chain's name is taken from its main character and mascot, [[Chuck E. Cheese (character)|Chuck E. Cheese]]. The first location opened as Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in [[San Jose, California]]. It was the first [[family restaurant]] to integrate food with arcade games and animated entertainment.\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in 1984, the chain was acquired in 1985 by Brock Hotel Corporation, parent company of competitor [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]]. The merger formed a new parent company, [[ShowBiz Pizza Place|ShowBiz Pizza Time, Inc.]] which began unifying the two brands in 1990, renaming every location Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza. It was later shortened to Chuck E. Cheese's in 1994, and Chuck E. Cheese in 2019. Parent company [[ShowBiz Pizza Place|ShowBiz Pizza Time]] also became CEC Entertainment in 1998. \n\nAs of June 25, 2020, CEC Entertainment owned 611 Chuck E. Cheese venues in 47 U.S. states, four Canadian provinces, and three Puerto Rican municipalities. The COVID-19 pandemic put significant financial strain on the company, and CEC Entertainment filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11 in the Southern District of [[Texas]] on June 25, 2020. The announcement was coordinated with 47 states and 16 countries including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Mexico]], [[Chile]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[India]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chuck E.
