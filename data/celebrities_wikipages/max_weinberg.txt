He is the father of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] drummer [[Jay Weinberg]].\n\nWeinberg grew up in suburban [[New Jersey]] and began drumming at an early age. He attended college planning to be a lawyer but got his big break in music in 1974 when he won an audition to become the drummer for Springsteen. Weinberg became a mainstay of Springsteen's long concert performances. Springsteen dissolved the band in 1989, and Weinberg spent several years considering a law career and trying the business end of the music industry before deciding he wanted to continue with drumming.\n\nIn 1993, Weinberg got the role as bandleader of [[Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band#The Max Weinberg 7|The Max Weinberg 7]] for ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien''. Weinberg's drums-driven [[jump blues]] sound and his role as a comic foil prospered along with the show, giving him a second career. In 1999, Springsteen re-formed the E Street Band for a series of tours and albums; Weinberg worked out an arrangement that allowed him to play with both O'Brien and Springsteen. In 2009, Weinberg moved to the short-lived ''Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien'' as leader of [[Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band#Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band|Max Weinberg and The Tonight Show Band]]. After that ended, he began touring with his own ensembles, and in 2010 chose not to follow O'Brien to the new ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' show. Weinberg continued playing with Springsteen, and in 2014 was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of the E Street Band.\n\n==Early life==\nWeinberg was born on April 13, 1951, to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], New Jersey,<ref name=\"santelli\">{{cite book | last=Santelli | first=Robert | title=Greetings From E Street: The Story of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band | publisher=[[Chronicle Books]] | year=2006 | location=San Francisco | isbn=0-8118-5348-9}} p. 33.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com/jersey-boy/|title=Mighty Max Weinberg|last=Leichman|first=Joey|date=October 30, 2015|website=[[Jewish Standard]]|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> to parents Bertram Weinberg, an [[Attorneys in the United States|attorney]], and Ruth Weinberg,<ref name=\"benarde-238\">{{cite book | last=Benarde | first=Scott R. | title=Stars of David: Rock 'n' roll's Jewish Stories | publisher=[[University Press of New England]] | year=2003 | isbn=1-58465-303-5 | page=238}}</ref> a high school [[physical education]] teacher.<ref name=\"schleier\"/> He has three sisters, Patty, Nancy and Abby.
