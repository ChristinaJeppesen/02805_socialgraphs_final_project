The smaller snowball grows by picking up additional snow as it rolls. The terms \"[[snowball effect]]\" and \"snowballing\" are derived from this process. The Welsh dance \"[[Nantgarw tradition|Y Gasseg Eira]]\" also takes its name from an analogy with rolling a large snowball. This method of forming a large snowball is often used to create the sections needed to build a [[snowman]].\n\nThe underlying physical process that makes snowballs possible is [[sintering]], in which a solid mass is compacted while near the melting point.<ref>{{Cite book \n  | isbn = 9781421402154 \n  | title = Gliding for Gold: The Physics of Winter Sports \n  | first = Mark \n  | last = Denny \n  | publisher = JHU Press\n  | year =  2011 }}</ref> Scientific theories about snowball formation began with a lecture by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1842, examining the attractive forces between ice particles.

Reduced pressure leads to a light and soft snowball. Compacting humid  or \"packing\" snow by applying a high pressure produces a harder snowball, sometimes called an ice ball, which can injure an opponent during a snowball fight.\n\nTemperature is important for snowball formation. It is hard to make a good snowball if the snow is too cold.<ref name=\"schmitz\"/> In addition, snowballs are difficult to form with a dry powdery snow. In temperatures below {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}, there is little free water in the snow, which leads to crumbly snowballs. At {{Convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}} or above, melted water in the snow results in a better cohesion.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/ISSW14_paper_P2.24.pdf |title=Granulation of Snow: Experiments and Discrete Element Modeling |first1=Walter |last1=Steinkogler |first2=Johan |last2=Gaume |first3=Henning |last3=L\u00f6we |first4=Betty |last4=Sovilla |first5=Michael |last5=Lehning |date=2014 |conference=International Snow Science Workshop |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328052228/https://arc.lib.montana.edu/snow-science/objects/ISSW14_paper_P2.24.pdf |archive-date=28 March 2020 |location=Baniff |pages=733{{ndash}}737 |access-date=28 March 2020 }}</ref> Above a certain temperature, however, the snowball too easily becomes [[slush]], which lacks mechanical strength and no longer sticks together.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Morag Challenor | chapter = No-Ball Snow | page = 157 | title = Does Anything Eat Wasps?: And 101 Other Unsettling, Witty Answers to Questions You Never Thought You Wanted to Ask\n| editor = New Scientist\n| publisher = Simon and Schuster\n| year = 2006 \n| isbn = 9780743299176 }}</ref> This effect is used in the rule that, in skiing areas, there is a high risk of avalanche if it is possible to squeeze water out of a snowball.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | title= Developing Interfacial Phase Diagrams for Applications in Activated Sintering and Beyond: Current Status and Future Directions\n | first = Jian \n | last = Luo\n | journal = Journal of the American Ceramic Society\n | date = 2012-01-16\n | volume = 95 \n | issue = 8 \n | pages = 2358\u20132371 \n | doi = 10.1111/j.1551-2916.2011.05059.x}}</ref>\n\n== Natural snowballs ==\n{{Main| Snow roller}}\nUnder certain unusual circumstances, [[Snow roller|natural snowball]]s form as a result of wind, without human intervention.
