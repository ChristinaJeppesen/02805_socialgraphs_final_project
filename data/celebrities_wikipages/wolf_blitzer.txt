In 1973, he caught the eye of ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' editor [[Ari Rath]], who hired Blitzer as a Washington correspondent for the English-language Israeli newspaper.

Sadat responded that such visits would be possible after an end to the state of belligerence between the two nations. In November of that year, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel, and Blitzer covered the negotiations between the two countries from the first joint Israeli-Egyptian press conference in 1977, to the final negotiations that would lead to the signing of the [[Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty]] two years later.<ref name=jpost/>\n\nIn 1985, Blitzer published his first book, ''Between Washington and Jerusalem: A Reporter's Notebook'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1985).
