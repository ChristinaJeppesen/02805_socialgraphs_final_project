Dickinson was known as the \"'''Penman of the Revolution'''\" for his twelve ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'', published individually in 1767 and 1768, and he also wrote \"[[The Liberty Song]]\" in 1768.\n\nAs a member of the [[First Continental Congress]], where he signed the [[Continental Association]], Dickinson drafted most of the 1774 [[Petition to the King]], and then, as a member of the [[Second Continental Congress]], he wrote the 1775 [[Olive Branch Petition]]. Both of these attempts to negotiate with King [[George III]] of Great Britain failed. Dickinson also reworked [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s language to write the final draft of the 1775 [[Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms]].\n\nWhile in Congress, Dickinson served on the committee that wrote the [[Model Treaty]], a template for seeking alliances with foreign countries, but he opposed independence from Great Britain. He either abstained or was absent from the vote on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and refused to sign the document after its passage. Nevertheless, Dickinson wrote the first draft of the 1776\u20131777 [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] and served as a militia officer during the [[American Revolution|Revolution]]. He later was elected president of the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|1786 Annapolis Convention]], which called for the [[History of the United States Constitution|Constitutional Convention of 1787]], and as a delegate from [[Delaware]], he [[Signers of the United States Constitution|signed the United States Constitution]].\n\nOne of the wealthiest men in the [[British colonization of the Americas|British American colonies]], Dickinson served as [[List of governors of Delaware|president of Delaware]] (1781\u20131783) and [[List of governors of Pennsylvania|president of Pennsylvania]] (1782\u20131785).

There, with {{convert|400|acre|km2|1}} on the banks of the [[Choptank River]], Walter began a plantation, ''Croisadore'', meaning \"cross of gold.\"  Walter also bought {{convert|800|acre|km2|1}} on [[St. Jones Neck]] in what became [[Kent County, Delaware]].<ref>The Duke of York Record 1646\u20131679, Printed by order of the General Assembly of the State of Delaware, 1899</ref>\n\n''Croisadore'' passed through Walter's son, William, to his grandson, Samuel, the father of John Dickinson. Each generation increased the landholdings so that Samuel inherited {{convert|2500|acre}} on five farms in three Maryland counties; over his lifetime he increased that to {{convert|9000|acre}}. He also bought the Kent County property from his cousin and expanded it to about {{convert|3000|acre}}, stretching along the [[St. Jones River]] from [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] to the [[Delaware Bay]]. There he began another plantation and called it [[John Dickinson House|Poplar Hall]]. These plantations were large, profitable agricultural enterprises worked by [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]], until 1777 when John Dickinson freed the enslaved of Poplar Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/c-eight/america/dick6.htm |title=John Dickinson: timeline |publisher=Historyhome.co.uk |date=January 5, 2011 |access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSamuel Dickinson married Judith Troth (1689\u20131729) on April 11, 1710. They had nine children; William, Walter, Samuel, Elizabeth, Henry, Elizabeth \"Betsy,\" Rebecca, and Rachel. The three eldest sons died of [[smallpox]] while in London seeking their education. Widowed, with two young children, Henry and Betsy, Samuel married Mary Cadwalader in 1731. She was the daughter of Martha Jones (granddaughter of Dr. [[Thomas Wynne]]) and the prominent Quaker John Cadwalader who was also the grandfather of General [[John Cadwalader (general)|John Cadwalader]] of Philadelphia. Their sons, John, Thomas, and [[Philemon Dickinson|Philemon]] was born in the next few years.\n\nFor three generations the Dickinson family had been members of the Third Haven Friends Meeting in Talbot County, and the Cadwaladers were members of the Meeting in Philadelphia. But in 1739, John Dickinson's half-sister, Betsy, was married in an Anglican church to Charles Goldsborough in what was called a \"disorderly marriage\" by the Meeting. The couple would be the grandparents of [[Governor of Maryland|Maryland Governor]] [[Charles Goldsborough]].\n\nLeaving ''Croisadore'' to elder son Henry Dickinson, Samuel moved to Poplar Hall, where he had already taken a leading role in the community as judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Kent County. The move also placed Mary nearer her Philadelphia relations. Poplar Hall was situated on an artificially straightened section of the St. Jones River. There was plenty of activity delivering the necessities and shipping the agricultural products produced. Much of this product was wheat that along with other wheat from the region, was milled into a \"superfine\" flour.<ref name=\"hoffecker\">{{cite book |last=Hoffecker |first=Carol E. |title=Democracy in Delaware  |publisher=Cedar Tree Books |location=Wilmington, Delaware |year=2004 |isbn=1-892142-23-6}}</ref>{{rp|39}} Most people at this plantation were servants and slaves of the Dickinsons.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:Mrs. John Dickinson (Mary Norris) and Daughter, Sallie Norris Dickinson.jpg|thumb|Mary Norris Dickinson and Sallie Dickinson, 1773 portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]\n\nDickinson was educated at home by his parents and by recent immigrants employed for that purpose.

Dickinson was precocious and energetic and in spite of his love of Poplar Hall and his family was drawn to Philadelphia.\n\nAt 18, he began studying law under [[John Moland]] in Philadelphia. There he made friends with fellow students [[George Read (American politician, born 1733)|George Read]] and [[Samuel Wharton]], among others. By 1753, he went to London for three years of study at the [[Middle Temple]]. He spent those years studying the works of [[Edward Coke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] at the [[Inns of Court]], following in the footsteps of his lifelong friend, Pennsylvania Attorney General [[Benjamin Chew]],<ref>Publications of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania: Life and Writings of John Dickinson [vol. 1], pg.28.</ref> and in 1757 was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar beginning his career as barrister and solicitor.\n\nIn protest to the [[Townshend Acts]], Dickinson published ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]''. First published in the ''[[Pennsylvania Chronicle]]'', Dickinson's letters were re-printed by numerous other newspapers and became one of the most influential American political documents prior to the [[American Revolution]]. Dickinson argued that Parliament had the right to regulate commerce but lacked the right to levy duties for revenue. Dickinson further warned that if the colonies acquiesced to the Townshend Acts, Parliament would lay further taxes on the colonies in the future.<ref name=\"middlekauff1\">{{cite book|last1=Middlekauff|first1=Robert|title=The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution 1763\u20131789|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=161\u2013162}}</ref> After publishing these letters, he was elected in 1768 to the [[American Philosophical Society]] as a member.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=dKBKSiIICH8C&pg=PA383 |last1=Bell |first1=Whitfield J. | first2=Charles Jr. |last2=Greifenstein |title=Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |publisher=American Philosophical Society |year=1997 |volume=1 |pages=383\u2013390|isbn=9780871692269 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 19, 1770, Dickinson married [[Mary Norris Dickinson|Mary Norris]], known as Polly, a prominent and well educated thirty-year-old woman in Philadelphia with a substantial holding of real estate and personal property (including a 1,500 volume library, one of the largest in the colonies at the time) who had been operating her family's estate, Fair Hill, for several years by herself or with her sister.

In support of the cause, he continued to contribute declarations in the name of the Congress. Dickinson wrote the Olive Branch Petition as the Second Continental Congress' last attempt for peace with Britain (King George III did not even read the petition). But through it all, agreeing with George Read and many others in Philadelphia and the [[Delaware Colony|Lower Counties]], Dickinson's object was reconciliation, not independence and revolution. Dickinson prepared the first draft of the Articles of Confederation in 1776, after others had ratified the Declaration of Independence over his objection that it would lead to violence, and to follow through on his view that the Colonies would need a governing document to survive war against them. At the time he chaired the committee, charged with drafting the Articles, Dickinson was serving in the Continental Congress as a delegate from Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen the Continental Congress began the debate on the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 1, 1776, Dickinson reiterated his opposition to declaring independence at that time. Dickinson believed that Congress should complete the Articles of Confederation and secure a foreign alliance before issuing a declaration.  Dickinson also objected to violence as a means for resolving the dispute.  He abstained or absented himself from the votes on July 2 that declared independence and absented himself again from voting on the wording of the formal declaration on July 4. Dickinson understood the implications of his refusal to vote stating, \"My conduct this day, I expect will give the finishing blow to my once too great and, my integrity considered, now too diminished popularity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://delawaretoday.com/life-style/web-exclusive-who-was-delawares-john-dickinson-and-why-you-should-care/|title=Who Was Delaware's John Dickinson and Why You Should Care|first=William|last=Murchison|author-link=William Murchison|date=February 18, 2014|website=Delaware Today}}</ref> Dickinson refused to sign the declaration, and since a proposal had been brought forth and carried that stated \"for our mutual security and protection\" no man could remain in Congress without signing, Dickinson voluntarily left and joined the Pennsylvania militia.<ref name=wright>Wright, Robert K. and MacGregor, Jr., Morris J. \"Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution.\" Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.C.

But because of his unpopular opinion on independence, two junior officers were promoted above him.<ref name=wright/>\n\n==Return to Poplar Hall==\nDickinson resigned his commission in December 1776 and went to stay at Poplar Hall in Kent County. While there he learned that his home on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia had been confiscated and converted into a hospital. He stayed at Poplar Hall for more than two years. The [[Delaware General Assembly]] tried to appoint him as their delegate to the Continental Congress in 1777, but he refused. In August 1777, he served as a private with the Kent County militia at [[Middletown, Delaware]] under General [[Caesar Rodney]] to help delay General [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]'s march to Philadelphia. In October 1777, Dickinson's friend [[Thomas McKean]] appointed him brigadier general of the [[Delaware National Guard|Delaware Militia]], but again Dickinson declined the appointment. Shortly afterwards he learned that the British had burned down his and his wife's Fair Hill property during the Battle of Germantown.<ref>Publications of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania: Life and Writings of John Dickinson [vol. 1], 315.</ref>\n\nThese years were not without accomplishment however. In 1777, Dickinson, Delaware's wealthiest farmer and largest slaveholder,<ref name=forgotten>Gregg II, Gary L. and Hall, Mark David. \"America's Forgotten Founders.\" University of Louisville (2008), 97.</ref> decided to free his slaves. While [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]] was not a large slave-holding area, like farther south in Virginia, and even though Dickinson had only 37 slaves,<ref name=forgotten/> this was an action of some considerable courage.

During this term he signed the Articles of Confederation, having in 1776 authored their first draft while serving in the Continental Congress as a delegate from Pennsylvania. In August 1781, while still a delegate in Philadelphia, he learned that Poplar Hall had been severely damaged by a Loyalist raid. Dickinson returned to the property to investigate the damage and once again stayed for several months.\n\nWhile there, in October 1781, Dickinson was elected to represent Kent County in the [[Delaware Senate|State Senate]], and shortly afterwards the [[Delaware General Assembly]] elected him the president of Delaware. The General Assembly's vote was nearly unanimous, the only dissenting vote having been cast by Dickinson himself.<ref>{{cite book |title=Proceedings of the House of Assembly of the Delaware State, 1781\u20131792, and of the Constitutional Convention of 1792 |page=17 |last1=Bushman |first1=Claudia L. |last2=Hancock |first2=Harold Bell |last3=Homsey |first3=Elizabeth Moyne |publisher=University of Delaware Press |location=Newark, DE |year=1988 |isbn=978-0-87413-309-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KXBgFB2zXQC&q=delaware%20election%20state%20voting%20records%20history%201781&pg=PA17 |access-date=June 10, 2013}}</ref> Dickinson took office on November 13, 1781, and served until November 7, 1782. Beginning his term with a \"Proclamation against Vice and Immorality,\" he sought ways to bring an end to the disorder of the days of the Revolution. It was a popular position and enhanced his reputation both in Delaware and Pennsylvania. Dickinson then successfully challenged the Delaware General Assembly to address lagging militia enlistments and to properly fund the state's assessment to the Confederation government. And recognizing the delicate negotiations then underway to end the American Revolution, Dickinson secured the Assembly's continued endorsement of the French alliance, with no agreement on a separate peace treaty with Great Britain.\n\nHowever, as before, the lure of Pennsylvania politics was too great. On October 10, 1782, Dickinson was elected to the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania]]. On November 7, 1782, a joint ballot by the Council and the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] elected him as president of the council and thereby president of Pennsylvania. But he did not actually resign as president of Delaware. Even though Pennsylvania and Delaware had shared the same governor until very recently, attitudes had changed, and many in Delaware were upset at seemingly being cast aside so readily, particularly after the Philadelphia newspapers began criticizing the state for allowing the practice of multiple and non resident office holding. Dickinson's constitutional successor, [[John Cook (governor)|John Cook]], was considered too weak in his support of the Revolution, and it was not until January 12, 1783, when Cook called for a new election to choose a replacement, that Dickinson formally resigned.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:94%; margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! colspan=\"12\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"|'''[[Delaware General Assembly]]'''<br><small>''(sessions while President)''</small>\n|-\n!'''Year'''\n!'''Assembly'''\n!\n!'''Senate Majority'''\n!'''Speaker'''\n!\n!'''House Majority'''\n!'''Speaker'''\n|-\n|1781/82\n|[[Delaware General Assembly|6th]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |''non-partisan''\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |[[Thomas Collins (governor)|Thomas Collins]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |''non-partisan''\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |Simon Kollock\n|-\n|1782/83\n|[[Delaware General Assembly|7th]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |''non-partisan''\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |[[Thomas Collins (governor)|Thomas Collins]]\n|\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |''non-partisan''\n|{{Party shading/Federalist}} |[[Nicholas Van Dyke (politician, born 1738)|Nicholas Van Dyke]]\n|}\n\n==President of Pennsylvania==\nWhen the American Revolution began, Dickinson fairly represented the center of Pennsylvania politics. The old [[Proprietary Party|Proprietary]] and Popular parties divided equally in thirds over the issue of independence, as did Loyalists, moderate [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Whigs]] who later became [[Federalist Party|Federalists]], and Radicals or Constitutionalists. The old Pennsylvania General Assembly was dominated by the Loyalists and moderates and, like Dickinson, did little to support the burgeoning Revolution or independence, except protest. The Radicals took matters into their own hands, using irregular means to write the [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776]], which by law excluded from the franchise anyone who would not swear loyalty to the document or the Christian [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]]. In this way all Loyalists, moderate Whigs, and Quakers were kept out of government. This peremptory action seemed appropriate to many during the crises of 1777 and 1778 but less so in the later years of the Revolution, and the moderate Whigs gradually became the majority.\n\nDickinson's election to the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council]] was the beginning of a counterrevolution against the Constitutionalists.  He was elected president of Pennsylvania on November 7, 1782, garnering 41 votes to [[James Potter (Pennsylvania politician)|James Potter]]'s 32. As president he presided over the intentionally weak executive authority of the state and was its chief officer but always required the agreement of a majority to act. He was re-elected twice and served the constitutional maximum of three years; his election on November 6, 1783, was unanimous. On November 6, 1784, he defeated [[John Neville (general)|John Neville]], who also lost the election for vice president the same day. Working with small majorities in the General Assembly in his first two years and with the Constitutionalists in the majority in his last year, all issues were contentious. At first he endured withering attacks from his opponents for his alleged failure to fully support the new government in large and small ways. He responded ably and survived the attacks. He managed to settle quickly the old boundary dispute with Virginia in southwestern Pennsylvania but was never able to satisfactorily disentangle disputed titles in the [[Wyoming Valley]] resulting from prior claims of Connecticut to those lands. An exhausted Dickinson left office October 18, 1785. On that day a special election was held in which [[Benjamin Franklin]] was unanimously elected to serve the ten days left in Dickinson's term.\n\nPerhaps the most significant decision of his term was his patient, peaceful management of the [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783]].  This was a violent protest of Pennsylvania veterans who marched on the Continental Congress demanding their pay before being discharged from the [[Continental Army]]. Somewhat sympathizing with their case, Dickinson refused Congress's request to bring full military action against them, causing Congress to vote to remove themselves to [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

He was quickly appointed to represent Delaware at the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] where he served as its president. In 1787, Delaware sent him as one of its delegates to the [[History of the United States Constitution|Constitutional Convention of 1787]], along with [[Gunning Bedford Jr.]], [[Richard Bassett (Delaware politician)|Richard Bassett]], George Read, and [[Jacob Broom]]. There, he supported the effort to create a strong central government but only after the [[Connecticut Compromise|Great Compromise]] assured that each state, regardless of size, would have an equal vote in the future [[United States Senate]]. As he had done with the Articles, he also carefully drafted it with the term \"Person\" rather than \"Man\" as was used in the Declaration of Independence. He prepared initial drafts of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Following the Convention he promoted the resulting Constitution in a series of nine essays, written under the pen name ''Fabius''.\n\nIn 1791, Delaware convened a convention to revise its existing [[Delaware Constitution of 1776|Constitution]], which had been hastily drafted in 1776. Dickinson was elected president of this convention, and although he resigned the chair after most of the work was complete, he remained highly influential in the content of the final document. Major changes included the establishment of a separate Chancery Court and the expansion of the franchise to include all taxpayers. Dickinson remained neutral in an attempt to include a prohibition of slavery in the document, believing the General Assembly was the proper place to decide that issue. The new [[Delaware Constitution of 1792|Constitution]] was approved June 12, 1792. Dickinson had freed his slaves conditionally in 1776 and fully by 1787.\n\nOnce more Dickinson was returned to the State Senate for the 1793 session but served for just one year before resigning because of his declining health. In his final years, he worked to further the abolition movement and donated a considerable amount of his wealth to the \"relief of the unhappy\". In 1801, Dickinson published two volumes of his collected works on politics.\n\n==Death and legacy==\n{{Infobox designation list\n| embed                   =\n| designation1            = Pennsylvania\n| designation1_offname    = John Dickinson (1732\u20131808)\n| designation1_type       = Roadside\n| designation1_criteria   = American Revolution, Government & Politics 18th Century, Military\n| designation1_date       = September 23, 2001\n| delisted1_date          =\n| designation1_partof     =\n| designation1_number     =\n| designation1_free1name  = Location\n| designation1_free1value = Montgomery Ave. at Haverford Ave., Narberth\n| designation1_free2name  = Marker Text\n| designation1_free2value = <small>Statesman, author.

While he had been economically reliant on them, he also wanted slavery to end.  By freeing all of his slaves upon his death, he thought this would contribute to the United States of America having a future without slavery.  Like many of the founders he believed slavery would die \"a natural death.\"<ref>Lincoln's Little War by Webb B.

Dickinson College and Dickinson School of Law (now of the Pennsylvania State University), separate institutions each operating a campus located in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, on land inherited and managed by his wife Mary Norris, were named for them.  Dickinson College was originally named \"John and Mary's College\" but was renamed to avoid an implication of royalty by confusion with \"William and Mary.\" And along with his ''[[Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania]]'', Dickinson also authored ''[[The Liberty Song]]''.\n\nDickinson Street in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] is named in his honor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp |title=Odd Wisconsin Archives |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date=March 29, 2006 |access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> as is [[John Dickinson High School]] in [[Milltown, Delaware]], and Dickinson Hall at the [[University of Delaware]].\n\nAn original stage play \u201cExcept, Mr. Dickinson\u201d was presented at the 15th St Annual Meeting house in an off Broadway setting.

As an intellectual, he thought that men should think for themselves,<ref name=\"Colbourn2\">{{cite journal|last=Colbourn|first=Trevor H.|year=1959|title=John Dickinson, Historical Revolutionary.|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20089207|journal=The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|volume=83|pages=271\u2013292|jstor=20089207|number=3}}</ref>{{rp|271}} and his deepening studies led him to refuse to sign the Declaration of Independence. He did not think it wise to plunge into immediate war; rather he thought it best to use diplomacy to attain political ends and used the insights he gained from his historical studies to justify his caution.<ref name=\"Colbourn2\" />{{rp|286}} Given that Dickinson was raised in an aristocratic family, his cautious and thoughtful temperament as a Quaker gave rise to his conservatism and prudent behavior. As Dickinson became more politically savvy, his understanding of historical movements led him to become a revolutionary.<ref name=\"Colbourn2\" />{{rp|273}} Dickinson was very careful and refined in thought.<ref>Powell, John H. \"John Dickinson and the Constitution.\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 60, no. 1 (1936): 5.</ref>  Dickinson wrote in 1767, \"We cannot act with too much caution in our disputes. Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and respectful behavior, may, by imprudence, be enlarged to an incurable rage.\"<ref>Powell, John H. \"John Dickinson and the Constitution.\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 60, no. 1 (1936): 6.</ref>  He did not behave rashly, insisting that prudence was the key to great politics. Dickinson used his study of history and furthered his education to become a lawyer, which exposed him to more historical schooling.<ref name=\"Colbourn2\" />{{rp|273}} His education and religion allowed him to make important political decisions based on reason and sound judgment. John Powell states, \"...these forces of [[Puritans|Puritanism]] had a vigorous expression. It is precisely because Dickinson epitomized the philosophic tenets of the Puritan Revolution that his theories were of enormous importance in the formation of the Constitution, and have considerable meaning for us today.\"<ref>Powell, John H. \"John Dickinson and the Constitution.\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 60, no. 1 (1936): 11.</ref>  His studies of history and religious viewpoints had a profound impact on his political thought and actions.<ref name=\"Colbourn2\" />{{rp|279}}\n\nDickinson incorporated his learning and religious beliefs to counteract what he considered the mischief flowing from  the perversion of history and applied them to its proper use according to his understanding.<ref>Charles J. Stille. \"The Life and Times of John Dickinson 1732-1808.\" Kessinger Publishing, LLC (2010), 330</ref> His religiosity contributed heavily to his discernment of politics. Quakers disseminated their theologico-political thought aggressively and retained a significant measure of political influence.<ref>Jane E. Calvert. \"Quaker Constitutionalism and the Political Thought of John Dickinson.\" Cambridge University Press (2008), 279.</ref> Dickinson's political thought, given his education and religion, was influential towards the founding of the United States. The political theory of Quakers was informed by their theology and [[ecclesiology]],<ref>Jane E. Calvert. \"Quaker Constitutionalism and the Political Thought of John Dickinson.\" Cambridge University Press (2008), 67.</ref> consequently Dickinson applied his religious beliefs and his belief in adhering to the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] in his approach to the Constitution,<ref>Charles J. Stille. \"The Life and Times of John Dickinson 1732-1808.\" Kessinger Publishing, LLC (2010), 378.</ref> referring to his historical knowledge as he did so. Quakers did use secular history as a guide for their political direction, and they considered scripture the most important historical source.<ref>Jane E. Calvert. \u201cQuaker Constitutionalism and the Political Thought of John Dickinson.\u201d Cambridge University Press (2008), 285.</ref>\n\nJane Calvert has contended that Dickinson was arguably an early feminist, partly because of his Quaker culture. He believed that women were spiritually equal to men and that they deserved equal religious rights. Unlike many men in the era, he took political counsel from women, particularly from his wife and his mother. Dickinson was also good friends with Quaker feminist [[Susanna Wright]] and was a correspondent of [[Catharine Macaulay]] and [[Mercy Otis Warren]]. He encouraged both Warren and Macaulay to continue writing. He additionally bought books that detailed the lives of strong Quaker women. As a lawyer, Dickinson often defended poor women in court, including Rachel Francisco, a \"free [[Mulatto|mollato]]\" who had been charged with infanticide. In 1776, while drafting the Articles of Confederation, he proposed the first gender inclusive language in an American constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=Journals of the Continental Congress \u2013 Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union; July 12, 1776|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/contcong_07-12-76.asp|access-date=February 7, 2013|publisher=The Avalon Project of Yale Law School}}</ref> In the proposed religious liberty clause, he wrote \"No person or persons in any Colony living peaceably under the Civil Government shall be molested or prejudiced in his or their {his or her} persons or Estate for his or her religious persuasion or Practise, nor be compelled to frequent or maintain or contribute to maintain any religious Worship, Place of Worship, or Ministry, contrary to his or her Mind.\"<ref>Jane Calvert, \"The Friendly Jurisprudence and Early Feminism of John Dickinson,\" in ''Great Christian Juritsts in American History'', p., 80-89</ref>\n\n==Almanac==\nDelaware elections were held October 1 and members of the General Assembly took office on October 20 or the following weekday. The State Legislative Council was created in 1776 and its Legislative Councilmen had a three-year term. Beginning in 1792 it was renamed the State Senate. State Assemblymen had a one-year term. The whole General Assembly chose the state president for a three-year term.\n\nPennsylvania elections were held in October as well. Assemblymen had a one-year term. The [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council]] was created in 1776, and counsellors were popularly elected for three-year terms. A joint ballot of the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the Council chose the president from among the twelve counsellors for a one-year term. Both assemblies chose the Continental Congressmen for a one-year term as well as the delegates to the U.S. Constitution Convention.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:94%; margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Public Offices\n|-\n!
