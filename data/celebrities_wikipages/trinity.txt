The story of Stephen depicts Stephen invoking and crying out to Jesus in the final moments of his life to receive his spirit (7:59\u201360). Acts further describes a common ritual practice inducting new members into the early Jesus sect by baptizing them in Jesus' name (2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5).{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|pp=194\u2013206}} According to [[Dale Allison]], Acts depicts the appearances of Jesus to Paul as a divine [[theophany]], styled on and identified with the God responsible for the theophany of [[Ezekiel]] in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Allison |2016|pp=807\u2013826}}\n\nThe [[Gospel of John]] has been seen as especially aimed at emphasizing Jesus' divinity, presenting Jesus as the ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', pre-existent and divine, from its first words: \"[[John 1:1|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God]]\" (John 1:1).<ref name=\"bbc-john\"/> The Gospel of John ends with Thomas's declaration that he believed Jesus was God, \"My Lord and my God!\" (John 20:28).{{sfn|Metzger|Coogan|1993|pp=782\u2013783}} There is no significant tendency among modern scholars to deny that John 1:1 and John 20:28 identify Jesus with God.{{sfn|Brown|1970|pp=1026, 1032}} John also portrays Jesus as the agent of creation of the universe.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1967|p=142}}\n\nOne of the most common verses emphasizing Jesus divinity is John 1:1.

This development begins early in the New Testament, as the Spirit of God receives much more emphasis and description comparably than it had in earlier Jewish writing. Whereas there are 75 references to the Spirit within the [[Old Testament]] and 35 identified in the non-biblical [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the New Testament, despite its significantly shorter length, mentions the Spirit 275 times. In addition to its larger emphasis and importance placed on the Spirit in the New Testament, the Spirit is also described in much more personalized and individualized terms than earlier.{{sfn|Hurtado|2018|p=62}} [[Larry Hurtado]] writes;\n{{blockquote|Moreover, the New Testament references often portray actions that seem to give the Spirit an intensely personal quality, probably more so than in Old Testament or ancient Jewish texts. So, for example, the Spirit \"drove\" Jesus into the wilderness (Mk 1:12; compare \"led\" in Mt. 4:1/Lk 4:1), and Paul refers to the Spirit interceding for believers (Romans 8:26\u201327) and witnessing to believers about their filial status with God (Romans 8:14\u201316). To cite other examples of this, in Acts the Spirit alerts Peter to the arrival of visitors from Cornelius (10:19), directs the church in Antioch to send forth Barnabas and Saul (13:2\u20134), guides the Jerusalem council to a decision about Gentile converts (15:28), at one point forbids Paul to missionize in Asia (16:6), and at another point warns Paul (via prophetic oracles) of trouble ahead in Jerusalem (21:11).{{sfn|Hurtado|2018|p=62}} }}\n\nThe Holy Spirit is described as God in the book of the [[Acts of the Apostles]]<blockquote>But Peter said, \u201cAnanias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? 4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God.\u201d Acts 5:3-4</blockquote>Peter first says Ananias is lying to the Holy Spirit, he then says he is lying to God.\n\nIn the New Testament, the Spirit is not portrayed as the recipient of [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic]] devotion, which instead, is typically offered to God the Father and to the risen/glorified Jesus. Although what became mainstream Christianity subsequently affirmed the propriety of including the Spirit as the recipient of worship as reflected in the developed form of the [[Nicene Creed]], perhaps the closest to this in the New Testament is in Matthew 28:19 and 2 Corinthians 13:14 which describe the Spirit as the subject of religious ritual.{{sfn|Hurtado|2018|p=64}}\n\n====Holy Spirit in later Christian theology====\nAs the [[Arian controversy]] was dissipating, the debate moved from the deity of Jesus Christ to the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and Son. On one hand, the [[Pneumatomachi]] sect declared that the Holy Spirit was an inferior person to the Father and Son. On the other hand, the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] argued that the Holy Spirit was equal to the Father and Son in nature or substance.\n\nAlthough the main text used in defense of the deity of the Holy Spirit was Matthew 28:19, Cappadocian Fathers such as [[Basil the Great]] argued from other verses such as \"But Peter said, 'Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart?

According to their understanding, because \"breath\" and \"spirit\" in Hebrew are both \"\u05e8\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7\u05b7\" (\"ruach\"), Psalm 33:6 is revealing the roles of the Son and Holy Spirit as co-creators. And since, according to them,{{sfn|Basil of Caesarea|1980|loc=Ch. 16}} because only the holy God can create holy beings such as the angels, the Son and Holy Spirit must be God.\n\nYet another argument from the Cappadocian Fathers to prove that the Holy Spirit is of the same nature as the Father and Son comes from \"For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God\" (1 Corinthians 2:11). They reasoned that this passage proves that the Holy Spirit has the same relationship to God as the spirit within us has to us.{{sfn|Basil of Caesarea|1980|loc=Ch. 16}}\n\nThe Cappadocian Fathers also quoted, \"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?\" (1 Corinthians 3:16) and reasoned that it would be blasphemous for an inferior being to take up residence in a temple of God, thus proving that the Holy Spirit is equal with the Father and the Son.{{sfn|Basil of Caesarea|1980|loc=Ch. 19}}\n\nThey also combined \"the servant does not know what his master is doing\" (John 15:15) with 1 Corinthians 2:11 in an attempt to show that the Holy Spirit is not the slave of God, and therefore his equal.{{sfn|Basil of Caesarea|1980|loc=Ch. 21}}\n\nThe Pneumatomachi contradicted the Cappadocian Fathers by quoting, \"Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?\" (Hebrews 1:14) in effect arguing that the Holy Spirit is no different from other created angelic spirits.{{sfn|Arendzen|1911}} The Church Fathers disagreed, saying that the Holy Spirit is greater than the angels, since the Holy Spirit is the one who grants the foreknowledge for prophecy (1 Corinthians 12:8-10) so that the angels could announce events to come.{{sfn|Basil of Caesarea|1980|loc=Ch. 16}}\n\n== Early Christianity ==\n{{further|Trinitarianism in the Church Fathers}}\n\n===Before the Council of Nicaea===\n[[File:Dogmatic sarcophagus.JPG|thumb|right|Detail of the [[Early Christian art and architecture|earliest known artwork]] of the Trinity, the [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus|Dogmatic or Trinity Sarcophagus]], {{circa}} 350 ([[Vatican Museums]]): Three similar figures, representing the Trinity, are involved in the creation of [[Eve]], whose much smaller figure is cut off at lower right; to her right, [[Adam]] lies on the ground{{sfn|Milburn|1991|p=68}}]]\n\nWhile the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the [[New Testament]], it was first formulated as early Christians attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|pp=644\u2013648}}\n\nAn early reference to the three \u201cpersons\u201d of later Trinitarian doctrines appears towards the end of the first century, where [[Clement of Rome]] rhetorically asks in his [[First Epistle of Clement|epistle]] as to why corruption exists among some in the Christian community; \"Do we not have one God, and one Christ, and one gracious Spirit that has been poured out upon us, and one calling in Christ?\" (1 Clement 46:6).<ref>Ehrman, Bart D.

The only \"functions\" that are applied {{em|uniquely}} to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit respectively in Scripture are the following: \"Paternity\" to the Father, \"Filiation\" (Sonship) to the Son, and \"Passive Spiration\" or that which is \"breathed out\", to the Holy Spirit. Magliola goes on to explain:\n\n{{blockquote|Because such is the case (among other reasons), [[Karl Rahner]] rejects the \"psychological\" theories of Trinity which define the Father as Knower, for example, and the Son as the Known (i.e., Truth). Scripture in one place or another identifies Knowing with each of the three Persons all told. Which is to say, according to the {{lang|la|relationis oppositio}}, Knowing (in our example) does not define the Persons [qua individual Persons] at all, but the Unity of God instead. (Scripture's attribution of Knowing to any one Person at any one time is said to be just \"appropriated\" to the Person: it does not really belong to that unique Person).{{sfn|Magliola|2001|pp=404, 405}} }}\n\nMagliola, continuing the Rahnerian stance, goes on to explain that the Divine Persons necessarily relate to each other in terms of \"pure negative reference\", that is, the three \"Is Not\" relations represented in the {{lang|la|Scutum Fidei}} diagram are in each case a pure or absolute \"Is Not\". This is the case because the {{lang|la|relationis oppositio}} clause disallows the Persons to \"share\", qua Persons, the unique role that defines each of them. Lest he be misunderstood, Magliola, in a subsequent publication, makes sure to specify that each of the three Persons, while unique as a Person, is nonetheless\u2014because of the Divine \"consubstantiality\" and \"simplicity\"\u2014the ''one'' Reality that is God.{{sfn|Magliola|2014|pp=159\u2013161}}\n\n=== ''Perichoresis'' ===\n{{main|Perichoresis}}\n[[File:THE FIRST COUNCIL OF NICEA.jpg|thumb| A depiction of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in AD 325, at which the Deity of Christ was declared orthodox and [[Arianism]] condemned]]\n{{lang|grc-Latn|Perichoresis}} (from [[Greek language|Greek]], \"going around\", \"envelopment\") is a term used by some scholars to describe the relationship among the members of the Trinity. The Latin equivalent for this term is {{lang|la|circumincessio}}. This concept refers for its basis to {{bibleref2|John|10:38,14:11,14:20}}, where Jesus is instructing the disciples concerning the meaning of his departure. His going to the Father, he says, is for their sake; so that he might come to them when the \"other comforter\" is given to them. Then, he says, his disciples will dwell in him, as he dwells in the Father, and the Father dwells in him, and the Father will dwell in them. This is so, according to the theory of {{lang|grc-Latn|perichoresis}}, because the persons of the Trinity \"reciprocally contain one another, so that one permanently envelopes and is permanently enveloped by, the other whom he yet envelopes\" ([[Hilary of Poitiers]], ''Concerning the Trinity'' 3:1).<ref name=\"hilary-john\"/>  The most prominent exponent of {{lang|grc-Latn|perichoresis}} was [[John of Damascus]] (d. 749) who employed the concept as a technical term to describe both the interpenetration of the divine and human natures of Christ and the relationship between the hypostases of the Trinity.<ref>{{Cite dictionary|editor-last=Cross|editor-first=F. L.|title=Cicumincession |dictionary=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |edition=2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974}}</ref>\n\n{{lang|grc-Latn|Perichoresis}} effectively excludes the idea that God has parts, but rather is a [[divine simplicity|simple being]]. It also harmonizes well with the doctrine that the Christian's union with the Son in his humanity brings him into union with one who contains in himself, in Paul's words, \"all the fullness of deity\" and not a part.{{efn|See also [[Divinization (Christian)]]}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Perichoresis}} provides an intuitive figure of what this might mean. The Son, the eternal Word, is from all eternity the dwelling place of God; he is the \"Father's house\", just as the Son dwells in the Father and the Spirit; so that, when the Spirit is \"given\", then it happens as Jesus said, \"I will not leave you as orphans; for I will come to you.\"{{bibleref2c|John|14:18}}\n\n=== Economic and immanent Trinity ===\nThe term \"immanent Trinity\" focuses on who God is; the term \"economic Trinity\" focuses on what God does. According to the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'',\n\n{{blockquote|The Fathers of the Church distinguish between theology ({{lang|grc-Latn|theologia}}) and economy ({{lang|grc-Latn|oikonomia}}). \"Theology\" refers to the mystery of God's inmost life within the Blessed Trinity and \"economy\" to all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates his life. Through the {{lang|grc-Latn|oikonomia}} the {{lang|grc-Latn|theologia}} is revealed to us; but conversely, the {{lang|grc-Latn|theologia}} illuminates the whole {{lang|grc-Latn|oikonomia}}. God's works reveal who he is in himself; the mystery of his inmost being enlightens our understanding of all his works. So it is, analogously, among human persons. A person discloses himself in his actions, and the better we know a person, the better we understand his actions.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm ''CCC'' \u00a7236].</ref>}}\n\n{{blockquote|The whole divine economy is the common work of the three divine persons. For as the Trinity has only one and the same natures so too does it have only one and the same operation: \"The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are not three principles of creation but one principle.\" However, each divine person performs the common work according to his unique personal property. Thus the Church confesses, following the New Testament, \"one God and Father from whom all things are, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and one Holy Spirit in whom all things are\". It is above all the divine missions of the Son's Incarnation and the gift of the Holy Spirit that show forth the properties of the divine persons.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s2c1p2.htm ''CCC'' \u00a7258].</ref>}}\n\nThe ancient [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene theologians]] argued that everything the Trinity does is done by Father, Son, and Spirit working in unity with one will. The three persons of the Trinity always work inseparably, for their work is always the work of the one God. The Son's will cannot be different from the Father's because it is the Father's. They have but one will as they have but one being. Otherwise they would not be one God. On this point [[St. Basil]] said:\n\n{{blockquote|When then He says, \"I have not spoken of myself\", and again, \"As the Father said unto me, so I speak\", and \"The word which ye hear is not mine, but [the Father's] which sent me\", and in another place, \"As the Father gave me commandment, even so I do\", it is not because He lacks deliberate purpose or power of initiation, nor yet because He has to wait for the preconcerted key-note, that he employs language of this kind. His object is to make it plain that His own will is connected in indissoluble union with the Father. Do not then let us understand by what is called a \"commandment\" a peremptory mandate delivered by organs of speech, and giving orders to the Son, as to a subordinate, concerning what He ought to do. Let us rather, in a sense befitting the Godhead, perceive a transmission of will, like the reflexion of an object in a mirror, passing without note of time from Father to Son.<ref name=\"despiritu\"/>}}\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Aquinas]] the Son prayed to the Father, became a minor to the angels, became incarnate, obeyed the Father as to his human nature; as to his divine nature the Son remained God: \"Thus, then, the fact that the Father glorifies, raises up, and exalts the Son does not show that the Son is less than the Father, except in His human nature. For, in the divine nature by which He is equal to the Father, the power of the Father and the Son is the same and their operation is the same.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Hierarch panagia episcopi cropped.jpg|thumb|A Greek [[fresco]] of Athanasius of Alexandria, the chief architect of the Nicene Creed, formulated at Nicaea.]]\n[[Athanasius of Alexandria]] explained that the Son is eternally one in being with the Father, temporally and voluntarily subordinate in his incarnate ministry.<ref name=\"athanasius3\"/> Such human traits, he argued, were not to be read back into the eternal Trinity. Likewise, the [[Cappadocian Fathers]] also insisted there was no economic inequality present within the Trinity. As Basil wrote: \"We perceive the operation of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to be one and the same, in no respect showing differences or variation; from this identity of operation we necessarily infer the unity of nature.\"<ref name=\"basil\"/>\n\nThe traditional theory of \"appropriation\" consists in attributing certain names, qualities, or operations to one of the Persons of the Trinity, not, however, to the exclusion of the others, but in preference to the others. This theory was established by the Latin Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries, especially by [[Hilary of Poitiers]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], and [[Pope Leo I|Leo the Great]]. In the Middle Ages, the theory was systematically taught by the [[Scholasticism|Schoolmen]] such as [[Bonaventure]].{{sfn|Sauvage|1907}}\n\n=== Trinity and love ===\nAugustine \"coupled the doctrine of the Trinity with [[Christian anthropology|anthropology]].

If the Father is not the Son or the Spirit since the generator/begetter is not the generated/begotten nor the generation/generative process and vice versa, and since the lover is neither the beloved nor the love dynamic between them and vice versa, Christianity has provided as a response a concept of divine ontology and [[attributes of God in Christianity#Love|love]] different from common sense ([[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[attributes of God in Christianity#Impassibility|impassibility]], etc.):{{sfn|Carson |2000|p=9}} an [[Oblation|oblative]], sacrificial, martyrizing, crucifying, precisely kenotic concept.\n\n=== Trinity and will ===\n[[B.

Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Various nontrinitarian views, such as [[Adoptionism]], [[Monarchianism]], and [[Arianism]] existed prior to the formal definition of the Trinity doctrine in AD 325, 360, and 431, at the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, respectively.<ref name=\"vonharnack\"/> Following the adoption of trinitarianism at [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople in 381]], [[Arianism]] was driven from the Empire, retaining a foothold amongst the Germanic tribes. When the [[Franks]] converted to Catholicism in 496, however, it gradually faded out.{{sfn|Cross|Livingstone|2005|p=100}} Nontrinitarianism was later renewed in the [[Gnosticism]] of the [[Cathars]] in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, and in some groups arising during the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the 19th century.{{efn|See also [[Binitarianism]]}}\n\nArianism was condemned as [[Heresy#Christianity|heretical]] by the [[First Council of Nicaea#Arian controversy#Result of the debate|First Council of Nicaea]] and, lastly, with [[Sabellianism]] by the [[Second Ecumenical Council]] (Constantinople, 381 CE).{{sfn|Olson|1999|p=173}} Adoptionism was declared as heretical by the Ecumenical Council of Frankfurt, convened by the Emperor Charlemagne in 794 for the Latin West Church.{{sfn|Meens|2016|p=64}}\n\nModern nontrinitarian groups or [[Christian denomination|denominations]] include [[Christadelphians]], [[Christian Science]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Dawn Bible Students]], [[Iglesia ni Cristo]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Living Church of God]], [[Members Church of God International]], [[Oneness Pentecostalism|Oneness Pentecostals]], [[La Luz del Mundo]], the [[Church of God (Seventh Day)|Seventh Day Church of God]], [[Unitarianism#Modern Christian Unitarian organizations|Unitarian Christians]], [[United Church of God]], and [[The Shepherd's Chapel]].\n\nAs pointed out by [[Jonathan Israel]],<ref>[[Jonathan Israel]], \"The Dutch Republic, Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806\"</ref> the 17th Century [[Dutch Republic]] was more religiously tolerant than other European countries of the time, but its dominant Calvinist Church drew the line at groups who denied the Trinity; this was considered an intolerable aberration, and such groups were subject to various forms  of persecution in the Netherlands.\n\n== Other religions' views ==\n=== Judaism ===\n{{See also|God in Judaism|Judaism's view of Jesus|Shituf}}\nSome [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] writings have a Trinitarian-esque view of God, speaking of \"stages of God's being, aspects of the divine personality\", with God being \"three hidden lights, which constitute one essence and one root\".

Indeed, disbelievers have said, \"Truly, Allah is a third of three.\" Yet, there is no god except One God, and if they do not desist from what they say, a grievous punishment befalls the disbelievers. Will they not turn to Allah and ask His forgiveness? For Allah is most forgiving and merciful. Is not Messiah, son of Mary, only a messenger? Indeed, messengers had passed away prior to him. And his mother was an upright woman. They both ate food. Observe how we explain the signs for them, then observe how they turn away (from truth)!|Quran 5:72\u201375}}\n\nInterpretation of these verses by modern scholars has been varied. Verse 5:73 has been interpreted as a potential criticism of Syriac literature that references Jesus as \"the third of three\" and thus an attack on the view that Christ was divine.{{sfn|Griffith|2012|p=8|loc=note 7}} Another interpretation is that this passage should be studied from a rhetorical perspective; so as not to be an error, but an intentional misrepresentation of the doctrine of the Trinity in order to demonstrate its absurdity from an Islamic perspective.{{sfn|Zebiri|2006|p=274}} David Thomas states that verse 5:116 need not be seen as describing actually professed beliefs, but rather, giving examples of ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' (claiming divinity for beings other than God) and a \"warning against excessive devotion to Jesus and extravagant veneration of Mary, a reminder linked to the central theme of the Qur'an that there is only one God and He alone is to be worshipped.\"{{sfn|Thomas|2006|loc=\"Trinity\"}} When read in this light, it can be understood as an admonition, \"Against the divinization of Jesus that is given elsewhere in the Qur'an and a warning against the virtual divinization of Mary in the declaration of the fifth-century church councils that she is '[[Theotokos|God-bearer]]'.\" Similarly, Gabriel Reynolds, Sidney Griffith and Mun'im Sirry argue that this quranic verse is to be understood as an intentional caricature and rhetorical statement to warn from the dangers of deifiying Jesus or Mary.{{sfn|Sirry|2014|p=47}}{{sfn|Neuwirth|Sells|2016|pp=300\u2013304}} It has been suggested that the Islamic representation of the doctrine of the Trinity may derive from its description in some texts of [[Manichaeism]] \"where we encounter a trinity, consisting of a Father, a Mother of Life / the Living Spirit and the Original Man\".<ref name=\"reeth\">{{cite journal |last1=Van Reeth |first1=Jan M.

However depictions using three human figures appear occasionally in most periods of art.{{sfn|Schiller|1971|loc=figs 1; 5\u201316}}\n\nThe Father and the Son are usually differentiated by age, and later by dress, but this too is not always the case. The usual depiction of the Father as an older man with a white beard may derive from the biblical [[Ancient of Days]], which is often cited in defense of this sometimes controversial representation. However, in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] the Ancient of Days is usually understood to be God the Son, not God the Father (''see below'')\u2014early [[Byzantine]] images show Christ as the Ancient of Days,{{sfn|Cartlidge|Elliott|2001|p=240}} but this [[iconography]] became rare. When the Father is depicted in art, he is sometimes shown with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] shaped like an [[equilateral triangle]], instead of a circle. The Son is often shown at the Father's right hand (Acts 7:56). He may be represented by a symbol\u2014typically the Lamb ({{lang|la|[[agnus dei]]}}) or a cross\u2014or on a [[crucifix]], so that the Father is the only human figure shown at full size. In early medieval art, the Father may be represented by a hand appearing from a cloud in a blessing gesture, for example in scenes of the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]. Later, in the West, the Throne of Mercy (or \"Throne of Grace\") became a common depiction. In this style, the Father (sometimes seated on a [[throne]]) is shown supporting either a [[crucifix]]{{sfn|Schiller|1971| pp= 122\u2013124 and figs 409\u2013414}} or, later, a slumped crucified Son, similar to the [[Piet\u00e0]] (this type is distinguished in German as the {{lang|de|Not Gottes}}),{{sfn|Schiller|1971|pp= 219\u2013224 and figs 768\u2013804}} in his outstretched arms, while the Dove hovers above or in between them. This subject continued to be popular until the 18th century at least.\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, larger representations, other than the Throne of Mercy, became effectively standardised, showing an older figure in plain robes for the Father, Christ with his torso partly bare to display the wounds of his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and the dove above or around them. In earlier representations both Father, especially, and Son often wear elaborate robes and crowns. Sometimes the Father alone wears a crown, or even a [[papal tiara]].\n\nIn the later part of the [[Christian Era]], in Renaissance European iconography, the [[Eye of Providence]] began to be used as an explicit image of the Christian Trinity and associated with the concept of [[Divine Providence]]. Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye of Providence sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or [[sunburst]]s.{{sfn|Potts|1982|pp=68\u201378}}\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n<gallery>\nFile:France Paris St-Denis Trinity-CROPPED.jpg|Depiction of Trinity from [[Saint Denis Basilica]] in Paris (12th century)\nFile:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 4v.)
