Edgers reported that as early as 1994, Kelly's tour manager urged [[Jive Records]] founder [[Clive Calder]] to tell Kelly he would not release the singer's records if he continued to have \"incidents\" with young women after every concert he gave. Calder told the ''Post'' that he regretted not having done more at the time, saying \"Clearly, we missed something.\"<ref name=\"2018 Washington Post story\"/>\n\nFormer Jive president [[Barry Weiss]] told the newspaper that during twenty years with the label he never concerned himself with Kelly's private life and was unaware of two lawsuits filed against Kelly and the label by young women alleging sexual misconduct while they were minors. Jive Records had, in fact, successfully argued it was not [[Legal liability|liable]]. Larry Khan, another Jive executive who worked closely with the singer even after viewing the sex tape, likewise implied it was not the label's responsibility, and pointed to [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] as musicians whose labels continued to release and promote their records despite public awareness that they were involved with underage girls.<ref name=\"2018 Washington Post story\"/>\n\nAccording to ''Post, e''xecutives at [[Epic Records]] also took a similarly relaxed attitude towards allegations of Kelly's sexual misconduct. In 2002, after Kelly signed with the label, executive David McPherson allegedly avoided viewing a copy of a tape purportedly showing the singer having sex with an underage girl; he simultaneously warned Kelly's assistant that if it turned out to be Kelly on that tape, the label would drop him. McPherson did not respond to the ''Post''{{'}}s requests for comment.<ref name=\"2018 Washington Post story\"/>\n\nAn [[internship|intern]] with the label whose work suffered after she began a relationship with Kelly, ultimately costing her the position, settled with Epic for $250,000. Cathy Carroll, the executive she worked for, regularly rebuked her former subordinate for having an affair with a married man whenever the two met at social functions for years afterwards, and the damage to the woman's reputation led her to abandon her career in the music industry. Carroll told the newspaper the woman was \"starstruck ... A lot of times it's not really the men.\"<ref name=\"2018 Washington Post story\"/>\n\n''The Washington Post'' also suggested the labels were complicit in the sex-cult allegations from the previous summer's ''BuzzFeed'' piece. Employees at the studios where Kelly recorded were required to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and not enter certain rooms, which they said they believed were where Kelly made the young women and underage girls stay while he worked. Despite the agreements, the newspaper was able to publish screenshots of text exchanges where young women and underage girls in the rooms asked Kelly's assistants to let them out so they could go to the bathroom or get food. The newspaper also published pictures taken after Kelly had concluded a six-week session at a Los Angeles studio, paid for by his former record label, RCA Records, showing a cup of urine sitting on a piano and urine stains on the wooden floor of another room.<ref name=\"2018 Washington Post story\"/>\n\n==== Musical response to allegations ====\n{{Main|I Admit (R.

As to Jane Doe #4, he slapped her, choked her and spat on her, before demanding she give him oral sex.  As to Jane Doe #5, over a period of years, he spanked her, viciously assaulted her, confined her for periods of days and otherwise manipulated her, to ensure that she would perform for him sexually, including with other women and a man.

Similarly, between September 2015 and October 2015, Kelly transported Jane Doe #5, who was then 17 years old, from New York City to Oakland, California for the purpose of illegal sexual activity, as she was too young to consent to sex in California.\n\nRacketeering Acts Eight, Thirteen and Fourteen \u2013 Mann Act Violations \u2013 Jane Doe #5 and Jane Doe #6\n\nIn April 2015, Kelly arranged for Jane Doe #5 to fly from her home in Orlando, Florida, to Los Angeles, California, for the purpose of illegal sexual activity, which was illegal because Kelly knew he had an incurable sexually transmitted disease (\u201cSTD\u201d) and did not inform Jane Doe #5 about the STD prior to engaging in sexual intercourse with her.  In May of 2017 and again in February of 2018, Kelly arranged for Jane Doe #6 to fly from her home in San Antonio, Texas, to La Guardia Airport in Queens, New York, for the purpose of illegal sexual activity, which again was illegal because Kelly failed to disclose that he had an incurable STD and obtain Jane Doe #6\u2019s consent to engage in sexual intercourse under those circumstances.|author=[[United States Department of Justice]], [[United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York]]|title=\u201cR.
