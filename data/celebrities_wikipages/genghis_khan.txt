The Arab historian [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din]] asserted that Tem\u00fcjin was born in 1155, while the ''[[History of Yuan]]'' records his year of birth as 1162 and Tibetan sources implausibly present 1182 as the correct date.<ref name=Ter92/> Modern historical studies have largely attested the 1162 date presented by the Chinese history as the most realistic, given the significant problems associated with how either the 1155 or 1182 dates would reflect on other event's in Tem\u00fcjin's timeline.{{sfn|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=9\u201310}} Accepting a birth in 1155, for instance, would render Tem\u00fcjin a father at the age of 30 and would imply that he personally commanded the expedition against the [[Tangut people|Tanguts]] at the age of 72.{{sfn|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=9\u201310}} ''The Secret History of the Mongols'' relates that Tem\u00fcjin was an infant during the attack by the [[Merkits]], when a birth date of 1155 would have made him 18 years old.{{sfn|Ratchnevsky|1991|pp=9\u201310}} The 1162 date has meanwhile been attested by various sources, including a 1992 study of the [[Mongol calendar]] commissioned by [[UNESCO]] that suggested the specific date of 1 May 1162.<ref name=Ter92/>\n\nThe location of Tem\u00fcjin's birth largely shrouded in mystery, with a wide range of locations proposed, many in the vicinity of the mountain [[Burkhan Khaldun]].

With the help of a sympathetic guard, he escaped from the [[Yurt|ger]] (yurt) at night by hiding in a river crevice.{{Sfn|Atwood|2004a|p=5}} The escape earned Tem\u00fcjin a reputation. Soon, [[Jelme]] and [[Bo'orchu]] joined forces with him, and they and the guard's son [[Chilaun]] eventually became generals of Genghis Khan.{{Sfn|Rachewiltz|2015|p=7}}\n\n=== Wives and concubines ===\n{{Main|Wives of Genghis Khan}}\nAs was common for powerful Mongol men, Tem\u00fcjin had many wives and concubines.{{sfn|McLynn|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jcQzCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA169 169]}} These women were often queens or princesses that were taken captive from the territories he conquered or gifted to him by allies, vassals, or other tribal acquaintances.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|pp=74, 92}} His principal or most famous wives and concubines included: [[B\u00f6rte]], [[Yesugen]], [[Yesui]], [[Khulan Khatun]], [[M\u00f6ge Khatun]], [[Juerbiesu]], and [[Ibaqa Beki]].\n\nHe gave several of his high-status wives their own ''ordos'' or camps to live in and manage. Each camp also contained junior wives, concubines, and children. It was the job of the [[Kheshig]] (Mongol imperial guard) to protect the [[yurt]]s of Tem\u00fcjin's wives. The guards had to pay particular attention to the individual yurt and camp in which Tem\u00fcjin slept, which could change every night as he visited different wives.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|pp=14, 74, 104}} When he set out on his military conquests, he usually took one wife with him and left the rest of his wives and concubines to manage the empire in his absence.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|pp=19\u201320}}\n\n== Uniting the Mongol confederations, 1184\u20131206 ==\n{{Main|Rise of Genghis Khan}}\n[[File:Mongolia XI.jpg|thumb|The locations of the Mongolian tribes during the Khitan [[Liao dynasty]] (907\u20131125)]]\nIn the early 12th century, the Central Asian plateau north of China was divided into several prominent tribal [[confederation]]s, including [[Naimans]], [[Merkit]]s, [[Tatar]]s, [[Khamag Mongol]]s, and [[Keraites]], that were often unfriendly towards each other, as evidenced by random raids, revenge attacks, and [[Looting|plundering]].\n\n=== Early attempts at power ===\nTem\u00fcjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally (or, according to other sources, a [[vassal]]) to his father's ''anda'' (sworn brother or [[blood brother]]) [[Toghrul]], who was [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Keraites]]. This relationship was first reinforced when [[B\u00f6rte]] was kidnapped by Merkits in around 1184. To win her back, Tem\u00fcjin called on the support of Toghrul, who offered 20,000 of his Keraite warriors and suggested that Tem\u00fcjin involve his childhood friend [[Jamukha]], who was Khan of his own tribe, the Jadaran.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grousset |first = Rene |title = Conqueror of the World: The Life of Chingis-khagan |location = New York, NY |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |year=1944 }}</ref>\n\n=== Rift with Jamukha and defeat ===\nAs [[Jamukha]] and Tem\u00fcjin drifted apart in their friendship, each began consolidating power and they became rivals. Jamukha supported the traditional [[Mongolian nobility|Mongolian aristocracy]], while Tem\u00fcjin followed a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] method, and attracted a broader range and lower class of followers.{{sfn|Hildinger|1997|p=113}} Following his earlier defeat of the Merkits, and a proclamation by the [[Shamanism|shaman]] [[Kokochu]] that the [[Tengrism|Eternal Blue Sky]] had set aside the world for Tem\u00fcjin, Tem\u00fcjin began rising to power.{{sfn|Hildinger|1997|p=114}} In 1186, Tem\u00fcjin was elected khan of the [[Mongols]]. Threatened by this rise, Jamukha attacked Temujin in 1187 with an army of 30,000 troops. Tem\u00fcjin gathered his followers to defend against the attack, but was decisively beaten in the [[Battle of Dalan Balzhut]].{{sfn|Hildinger|1997|p=114}}{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=xxvii}} However, Jamukha horrified and alienated potential followers by [[Death by boiling|boiling 70 young male captives alive]] in cauldrons.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p=41}} Toghrul, as Tem\u00fcjin's patron, was exiled to the [[Qara Khitai]].{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=23}} The life of Tem\u00fcjin for the next 10 years is unclear, as historical records are mostly silent on that period.{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=23}}\n\n=== Return to power ===\nAround the year 1197, the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] initiated an attack against their formal vassal, the [[Tatars]], with help from the [[Keraites]] and [[Mongols]]. Tem\u00fcjin commanded part of this attack, and after victory, he and Toghrul were restored by the Jin to positions of power.{{sfn|Lane|2004|p=23}} The Jin bestowed Toghrul with the honorable title of Ong Khan, and Tem\u00fcjin with a lesser title of ''j'aut quri''.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=35}}\n\nAround 1200, the main rivals of the [[Khamag Mongol|Mongol confederation]] (traditionally the \"Mongols\") were the [[Naimans]] to the west, the [[Merkit]]s to the north, the [[Tanguts]] to the south, and the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] to the east.\n\n[[File:Serven Khaalga Jurchen inscription.jpg|thumb|[[Jurchen script|Jurchen]] inscription (1196) in Mongolia relating to Tem\u00fcjin's alliance with the Jin against the Tatars]]\n\nIn his rule and his conquest of rival tribes, Tem\u00fcjin broke with Mongol tradition in a few crucial ways. He delegated authority based on merit and loyalty, rather than family ties.{{sfn|Weatherford|2004|p=44}} As an incentive for absolute obedience and the [[Yassa]] code of law, Tem\u00fcjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future war spoils. When he defeated rival tribes, he did not drive away their soldiers and abandon their civilians. Instead, he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe. He would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe, bringing them into his family. These political innovations inspired great loyalty among the conquered people, making Tem\u00fcjin stronger with each victory.{{sfn|Weatherford|2004|p=44}}\n\n=== Rift with Toghrul ===\n[[Senggum]], son of Toghrul (Wang Khan), envied Tem\u00fcjin's growing power and affinity with his father. He allegedly planned to assassinate Tem\u00fcjin. Although Toghrul was allegedly saved on multiple occasions by Tem\u00fcjin, he gave in to his son{{sfn|Man|2007|p={{page needed|date=May 2020}}}} and became uncooperative with Tem\u00fcjin. Tem\u00fcjin learned of Senggum's intentions and eventually defeated him and his loyalists.\n\n[[File:Djengiz Kh\u00e2n et Toghril Ong Khan.jpeg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan and Toghrul Khan, illustration from a 15th-century [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] manuscript]]\n\nOne of the later ruptures between Tem\u00fcjin and Toghrul was Toghrul's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to [[Jochi]], Tem\u00fcjin's first son. This was disrespectful in Mongolian culture and led to a war. Toghrul allied with [[Jamukha]], who already opposed Tem\u00fcjin's forces. However, the dispute between Toghrul and Jamukha, plus the desertion of a number of their allies to Tem\u00fcjin, led to Toghrul's defeat. Jamukha escaped during the conflict. This defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the [[Keraites|Keraite]] tribe.{{Sfn|Abbott|2014|p=362}}\n\nAfter conquering his way steadily through the Alchi Tatars, Keraites, and Uhaz Merkits and acquiring at least one wife each time, Tem\u00fcjin turned to the next threat on the steppe, the Turkic [[Naimans]] under the leadership of [[Tayang Khan]] with whom Jamukha and his followers took refuge.{{sfn|Broadbridge|2018|p=89}} The Naimans did not surrender, although enough sectors again voluntarily sided with Tem\u00fcjin.\n\nIn 1201, a [[Kurultai|Khuruldai]] elected [[Jamukha]] as [[Khan (title)|G\u00fcr Khan]], \"universal ruler\", a title used by the rulers of the [[Qara Khitai]]. Jamukha's assumption of this title was the final breach with Tem\u00fcjin, and Jamukha formed a coalition of tribes to oppose him. Before the conflict, several generals abandoned Jamukha, including [[Subutai]], [[Jelme]]'s well-known younger brother. After several battles, Jamukha was turned over to Tem\u00fcjin by his own men in 1205.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nAccording to ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', Tem\u00fcjin again offered his friendship to [[Jamukha]]. Tem\u00fcjin had killed the men who betrayed Jamukha, stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army. Jamukha refused the offer, saying that there can only be one sun in the sky, and he asked for a noble death. The custom was to die without spilling blood, specifically by having one's back broken. Jamukha requested this form of death, although he was known to have boiled his opponents' generals alive.{{citation needed|date =August 2020}}\n\n=== Sole ruler of the Mongol plains ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2022}}\n[[File:Genghis Khan's enthronement in 1206.jpg|thumb|Genghis Khan proclaimed Khagan of all Mongols.

The Naimans' defeat left Tem\u00fcjin as the sole ruler of the [[Eurasian Steppe|Mongol steppe]] \u2013 all the prominent confederations fell or united under his Mongol confederation.\n\nAccounts of Tem\u00fcjin's life are marked by claims of a series of betrayals and conspiracies. These include rifts with his early allies such as Jamukha (who also wanted to be a ruler of Mongol tribes) and Wang Khan (his and his father's ally), his son [[Jochi]], and problems with the most important [[shaman]], who allegedly tried to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother [[Qasar|Khasar]]. His [[military strategy|military strategies]] showed a deep interest in gathering [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] and understanding the [[motivation]]s of his rivals, exemplified by his extensive spy network and [[Yam (route)|Yam]] route systems. He seemed to be a quick student, adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered, such as [[siege warfare]] from the [[Military history of China (pre-1911)|Chinese]]. He was also ruthless, demonstrated by his tactic of [[measuring against the linchpin]], used against the tribes led by Jamukha.\n\nAs a result, by 1206, Tem\u00fcjin had managed to unite or subdue the [[Merkit]]s, [[Naimans]], [[Mongols]], Keraites, [[Tatars]], [[Uyghur Khaganate#Successors|Uyghurs]], and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule. This was a monumental feat. It resulted in peace between previously warring tribes, and a single political and military force. The union became known as the Mongols. At a ''[[Kurultai|Khuruldai]]'', a council of Mongol chiefs, Tem\u00fcjin was acknowledged as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the consolidated tribes and took the new title \"Genghis Khan\". The title [[Khagan]] was conferred posthumously by his son and successor \u00d6gedei who took the title for himself (as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]]).\n\nAccording to ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', the chieftains of the conquered tribes pledged to Genghis Khan by proclaiming:<blockquote>\"We will make you Khan; you shall ride at our head, against our foes. We will throw ourselves like lightning on your enemies. We will bring you their finest women and girls, their rich tents like palaces.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Hyslop|first1=Stephen Garrison|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KK2TikRZJpsC|title=Great Empires: An Illustrated Atlas|last2=Daniels|first2=Patricia|last3=Society (U.S.)|first3=National Geographic |date=2011|publisher=National Geographic Books |isbn=978-1-4262-0829-4|pages=174, 179}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cummins |first=Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYfTZiQPD5cC|title=History's Greatest Wars: The Epic Conflicts that Shaped the Modern World |year=2011|publisher=Fair Winds Press|isbn=978-1-61058-055-7|pages=95}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Military campaigns, 1207\u20131227 ==\n{{Campaignbox Genghis Khan's Campaigns}}\n{{Further|Mongol invasions and conquests}}\n\n=== Western Xia dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of Western Xia}}\n\nDuring the 1206 political rise of Genghis Khan, the Mongol Empire and its allies shared their western borders with the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] [[Western Xia]] dynasty. To the east and south of the Western Xia dynasty was the militarily superior [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], founded by the [[Manchu]]rian [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], who ruled northern China as well as being the traditional overlords of the Mongolian tribes for centuries.<ref name=\"tim may 1211\">May 2012, pg. 1211</ref>\n\nThough militarily inferior to the neighboring Jin, the Western Xia still exerted a significant influence upon the adjacent northern [[steppe]]s.<ref name=\"tim may 1211\" /> Following the death of the [[Keraites]] leader [[Ong Khan]] to Tem\u00fcjin's emerging [[Mongol Empire]] in 1203, Keriat leader Nilqa Senggum led a small band of followers into Western Xia before later being expelled from Western Xia territory.<ref name=\"tim may 1211\" />\n\n[[File:Bataille entre mongols & chinois (1211).jpeg|thumb|Battle between Mongol warriors and the [[China|Chinese]]]]\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge de Beijing (1213-1214).jpeg|thumb|Genghis Khan entering [[Beijing]].]]\n\nUsing his rival Nilga Senggum's temporary refuge in Western Xia as a pretext, Tem\u00fcjin launched a raid against the state in 1205 in the [[Khara-Khoto |Edsin]] region.<ref name=\"tim may 1211\" /> The next year, in 1206, Tem\u00fcjin was formally proclaimed Genghis Khan, ruler of all the Mongols, marking the official start of the Mongol Empire, and the same year [[Emperor Huanzong of Western Xia|Emperor Huanzong]] of the Western Xia was deposed by [[Li Anquan]] in a ''coup d'\u00e9tat''. In 1207, Genghis led another raid into Western Xia, invading the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos region]] and sacking [[Wuhai]], the main garrison along the [[Yellow River]], before withdrawing in 1208. Genghis then began preparing for a full-scale invasion, organizing his people, army and state to first prepare for war.<ref>Rossabi 2009, pg. 156</ref>\n\nBy invading Western Xia, Genghis Khan would gain a tribute-paying vassal, and also would take control of caravan routes along the [[Silk Road]] and provide the Mongols with valuable revenue.<ref name=kohn>Kohn 2007, pg. 205</ref> Furthermore, from Western Xia he could launch raids into the even more wealthy Jin dynasty.<ref>Man 2004, pg. 130</ref> He correctly believed that the more powerful young ruler of the Jin dynasty would not come to the aid of the Western Xia.

Luckily for the Mongols, Wanyan Jiujin, the field commander of the Jin army, made several tactical mistakes, including avoiding attacking the Mongols at the first opportunity using his overwhelming numerical superiority, and instead initially fortifying behind the Great wall. At the subsequent [[Battle of Yehuling]], which the Jin commander later committed to in the hope of using the mountainous terrain to his advantage against the Mongols, the general's emissary [[Shimo Ming'an|Ming'an]] defected to the Mongol side and instead handed over intelligence on the movements of the Jin army, which was subsequently outmanoeuvred, resulting in hundreds of thousands of Jin casualties. So many, in fact, that decades later, when the [[Daoism|Daoist]] sage [[Qiu Chuji]] was passing through this pass to meet Genghis Khan, he was stunned to still see the bones of so many people scattered in the pass. On his way back, he camped close to this pass for three days and prayed for the departed souls. In 1215, Genghis besieged the Jin capital of Zhongdu (modern-day [[Beijing]]). According to [[Ivar Lissner]], the inhabitants resorted to firing gold and silver cannon shot on the Mongols with their muzzle-loading cannons when their supply of metal for ammunition ran out.<ref name=\"Lissner\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0skIAQAAIAAJ&q=cannon+melting+silver+gold+shot|edition=4|year=1957|title=The living past |author=Ivar Lissner |publisher=Putnam's |page=193|access-date= April 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780136379676|url-access=registration|edition=2|year=1966|title=Operations economy: industrial applications of operations research|author1=Wolter J.

This forced the Jin ruler, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Jin|Emperor Xuanzong]], to move his capital south to [[Kaifeng]], abandoning the northern half of his empire to the Mongols. Between 1232 and 1233, [[Mongol siege of Kaifeng|Kaifeng fell to the Mongols]] under the reign of Genghis's third son and successor, \u00d6gedei Khan. The Jin dynasty collapsed in 1234, after the [[siege of Caizhou]].\n\n=== Qara Khitai ===\n{{Main|Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai}}\n\n[[Kuchlug]], the deposed [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the [[Naimans|Naiman]] confederation that Genghis Khan defeated and folded into his Mongol Empire, fled west and usurped the [[khanate]] of [[Qara Khitai]] (also known as the Western Liao, as it was originally established as remnants of the [[Liao dynasty]]). Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug, possibly to take him out of power. By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty. Therefore, Genghis sent only two [[Tumen (unit)|''tumen'']] (20,000 soldiers) against Kuchlug, under his younger general, [[Jebe]], known as \"The Arrow\".\n\nWith such a small force, the invading Mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among Kuchlug's supporters, leaving the Qara Khitai more vulnerable to Mongol conquest. As a result, Kuchlug's army was defeated west of [[Kashgar]]. Kuchlug fled again, but was soon hunted down by Jebe's army and executed. By 1218, as a result of the defeat of Qara Khitai, the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as [[Lake Balkhash]], which bordered [[Khwarezmia| Khwarazmia]], a Muslim state that reached the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west and [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south.<ref>Stephen Pow: ''The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan.''

Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarazmia as a commercial trading partner using the [[Silk Road]], and he initially sent a 500-man [[camel train|caravan]] to establish official trade ties with the empire. Genghis Khan and his family and commanders [[ortogh|invested]] in the caravan gold, silver, silk, various kinds of textiles and fabrics and pelts to trade with the Muslim traders in the Khwarazmian lands.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/02634937.2019.1652799|title=The role of the ortoq in the Mongol Empire in forming business partnerships|first=Enerelt|last=Enkhbold|date=October 2, 2019|journal=Central Asian Survey|volume=38|issue=4|pages=531\u2013547|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/02634937.2019.1652799|s2cid=203044817 }}</ref> However, [[Inalchuq]], the governor of the Khwarazmian city of [[Otrar]], attacked the caravan, claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarazmia. The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and hand over the perpetrators. Genghis Khan then sent a second group of three ambassadors (two Mongols and a Muslim) to meet the Shah himself, instead of the governor Inalchuq. The [[Shah]] had all the men shaved and the Muslim [[decapitation|beheaded]] and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors. Outraged, Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers (10 [[Tumen (unit)|tumens]]), his most capable generals and some of his sons. He left a commander and number of troops in China, designated his successors to be his family members and likely appointed [[\u00d6gedei]] to be his immediate successor and then went out to Khwarazmia.\n\n[[File:During the battle of Indus.jpg|thumb|left|Genghis Khan watches in amazement as the [[Khwarezm]]i [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]] prepares to [[Battle of the Indus|ford the Indus]].]]\n\nThe Mongol army under Genghis Khan, generals and his sons crossed the [[Tian Shan|Tien Shan]] mountains by entering the area controlled by the [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarazmian Empire]]. After compiling intelligence from many sources Genghis Khan carefully prepared his army, which was divided into three groups. His son [[Jochi]] led the first division into the northeast of Khwarazmia. The second division under [[Jebe]] marched secretly to the southeast part of Khwarazmia to form, with the first division, a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] on [[Samarkand]]. The third division under Genghis Khan and [[Tolui]] marched to the northwest and attacked Khwarazmia from that direction.\n\nThe Shah's army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shah's decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities. This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarazmia's defeats, as it allowed the Mongols, although exhausted from the long journey, to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarazmian forces instead of facing a unified defense. The Mongol army quickly seized the town of [[Otrar]], relying on superior strategy and tactics. Genghis Khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians, enslaved the rest of the population and executed Inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes, as retribution for his actions.\n\nNext, Genghis Khan [[Siege of Bukhara|besieged the city of Bukhara]]. [[Bukhara]] was not heavily fortified, with just a moat and a single wall, and the citadel typical of Khwarazmian cities. The city leaders opened the gates to the Mongols, though a unit of Turkish defenders held the city's citadel for another twelve days. The survivors from the citadel were executed, artisans and craftsmen were sent back to Mongolia, young men who had not fought were drafted into the Mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery.{{sfn|Morgan|1986|p={{page needed|date=May 2020}}}} After the surrender of Bukhara, Genghis Khan also took the unprecedented step of personally entering the city, after which he had the city's aristocrats and elites brought to the mosque, where, through interpreters, he lectured them on their misdeeds, saying: \"If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.\"{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{page needed|date=August 2021}}}}\n\n[[File:Genghis Khan empire-en.svg|upright=1.5|thumb|Significant conquests and movements of Genghis Khan and his generals]]\n\nWith the capture of Bukhara, the way was clear for the Mongols to advance on the capital of [[Samarkand]], which possessed significantly better fortifications and a larger garrison compared to Bukhara. To overcome the city, the Mongols engaged in intensive psychological warfare, including the use of captured Khwarazmian prisoners as body shields. After several days only a few remaining soldiers, loyal supporters of the [[Shah]], held out in the citadel. After the fortress fell, Genghis executed every soldier that had taken arms against him. According to the Persian historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]], the people of Samarkand were then ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city, where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory.<ref name=\"Juvayni\">{{cite web|first=George |last=Modelski |date=September 29, 2007|title=Central Asian world cities? |url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm|archive-date=January 18, 2012|publisher=University of Washington}}</ref> Similarly, Juvayni wrote that in the city [[Termez]], to the south of [[Samarkand]], \"all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain\".<ref name=\"Juvayni\" />\n\nJuvayni's account of mass killings at these sites is not corroborated by modern archaeology. Instead of killing local populations, the Mongols tended to enslave the conquered and either send them to Mongolia to act as menial labor or retain them for use in the war effort. The effect was still mass depopulation.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{page needed|date=August 2021}}}} The piling of a \"pyramid of severed heads\" happened not at [[Samarkand]] but at [[Nishapur]], where Genghis Khan's son-in-law [[Toquchar]] was killed by an arrow shot from the city walls after the residents revolted. The Khan then allowed his widowed daughter, who was pregnant at the time, to decide the fate of the city, and she decreed that the entire population be killed. She also supposedly ordered that every dog, cat and any other animals in the city by slaughtered, \"so that no living thing would survive the murder of her husband\".{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{page needed|date=August 2021}}}} The sentence was duly carried out by the Khan's youngest son [[Tolui]].<ref name=\"Nishapur\">[https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/genghis-khan-murder.htm The Truth About Nishapur] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210427193304/https://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/genghis-khan-murder.htm |date=April 27, 2021 }} How Stuff Works.

Genghis Khan subsequently ordered two of his generals, [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]], to destroy the remnants of the Khwarazmian Empire, giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this. The Shah died under mysterious circumstances on a small island in the Caspian Sea that he had retreated to with his remaining loyal forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the wealthy trading city of [[Konya-Urgench|Urgench]] was still in the hands of Khwarazmian forces. The assault on Urgench proved to be the most difficult battle of the Mongol invasion and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.\nAs usual, the artisans were sent back to Mongolia, young women and children were given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, and the rest of the population was massacred. The Persian scholar [[Ata al-Mulk Juvayni|Juvayni]] states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2&nbsp;million people were killed. These numbers are considered logistically implausible by modern scholars, but the sacking of Urgench was no doubt a bloody affair.{{sfn|Weatherford|2005|p={{page needed|date=August 2021}}}}\n\n=== Georgia, Crimea, Kievan Rus and Volga Bulgaria ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasions of Georgia and Armenia|Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria}}\n\n[[File:Gold coin of Genghis Khan, struck at the Ghazna (Ghazni) mint.jpg|thumb|Gold ''[[gold dinar|dinar]]'' of Genghis Khan, struck at the [[Ghazni|Ghazna]] (Ghazni) mint, dated 1221/2]]\n\nAfter the defeat of the Khwarazmian Empire in 1220, Genghis Khan gathered his forces in [[Iran|Persia]] and [[Armenia]] to return to the Mongolian steppes. Under the suggestion of [[Subutai]], the Mongol army was split into two forces. Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through [[Afghanistan]] and northern India towards Mongolia, while another 20,000 (two [[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]) contingent marched through the [[Caucasus]] and into Russia under generals [[Jebe]] and Subutai. They pushed deep into [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. The Mongols defeated the [[kingdom of Georgia]], sacked the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] trade-fortress of [[Caffa]] in [[Crimea]] and overwintered near the [[Black Sea]]. Heading home, Subutai's forces attacked the allied forces of the [[Cuman]]\u2013[[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]] and the poorly coordinated 80,000 [[Kievan Rus']] troops led by [[Mstislav the Bold]] of [[Halych]] and [[Mstislav III of Kiev]] who went out to stop the Mongols' actions in the area. [[Subutai]] sent emissaries to the [[Slavs|Slavic]] princes calling for a separate peace, but the emissaries were executed. At the [[Battle of Kalka River]] in 1223, Subutai's forces defeated the larger Kievan force. They may have been defeated by the neighbouring [[Volga Bulgars]] at the [[Battle of Samara Bend]]. There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], writing in Mosul some {{convert|1100|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} away from the event.<ref name=\"Chambers31\">John Chambers, ''The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe'', Atheneum, 1979. p.&nbsp;31</ref> Various historical secondary sources \u2013 Morgan, Chambers, Grousset \u2013 state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars, Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the (recently crushed) Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.<ref name=\"Chambers31\" /> The Russian princes then sued for peace. Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes. Not only had the Rus put up strong resistance, but also Jebe \u2013 with whom Subutai had campaigned for years \u2013 had been killed just prior to the Battle of Kalka River.<ref>Stephen Pow: ''The Last Campaign and Death of Jebe Noyan.''

Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals. Six Russian princes, including [[Mstislav III of Kiev]], were put under this platform and crushed to death.\n\nThe Mongols learned from captives of the abundant green pastures beyond the Bulgar territory, allowing for the planning for [[Mongol invasion of Europe|conquest of Hungary and Europe]]. Genghis Khan recalled Subutai back to Mongolia soon afterwards. The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe, in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path, remains unparalleled to this day, and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations, particularly in Europe. These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions. In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia. These invasions added [[Transoxiana]] and [[Iran|Persia]] to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way. Later under Genghis Khan's grandson [[Batu Khan|Batu]] and the [[Golden Horde]], the Mongols returned to conquer Volga Bulgaria and Kievan Rus' in 1237, concluding the campaign in 1240.\n\n=== Western Xia and Jin dynasty ===\n{{Main|Mongol invasion of China}}\n[[File:Map of China 1142.jpg|thumb|[[Western Xia]] dynasty, [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin/Jurchen dynasty]], [[Song dynasty]] and [[Kingdom of Dali]] in 1142]]\nThe vassal emperor of the Tanguts (Western Xia) had earlier refused to take part in the Mongol war against the Khwarezmid Empire. Western Xia and the defeated Jin dynasty formed a coalition to resist the Mongols, counting on the campaign against the Khwarazmians to preclude the Mongols from responding effectively.\n\nIn 1226, immediately after returning from the west, Genghis Khan began a retaliatory attack on the Tanguts. His armies quickly took Heisui, [[Zhangye|Ganzhou]], and Suzhou (not the Suzhou in Jiangsu province), and in the autumn he took [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Xiliang]]-fu. One of the Tangut generals challenged the Mongols to a battle near [[Helan Mountains]] but was defeated. In November, Genghis laid [[siege]] to the Tangut city [[Lingwu|Lingzhou]] and crossed the [[Yellow River]], defeating the Tangut relief army. According to legend, it was here that Genghis Khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory.\n\nIn 1227, Genghis Khan's army attacked and destroyed the Tangut capital of Ning Hia and continued to advance, seizing [[Lintiao]]-fu, [[Xining]] province, [[Xindu]]-fu, and [[Deshun]] province in quick succession in the spring. At Deshun, the Tangut general Ma Jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate. Ma Jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle. Genghis Khan, after conquering Deshun, went to [[Liupanshan]] ([[Qingshui County]], [[Gansu]] Province) to escape the severe summer. The new Tangut emperor quickly surrendered to the Mongols, and the rest of the Tanguts officially surrendered soon after. Not happy with their betrayal and resistance, Genghis Khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed, effectively ending the Tangut royal lineage.\n\n== Death and succession ==\n[[File:Genghis khan empire at his death.png|thumb|Mongol Empire in 1227 at Genghis Khan's death]]\n{{See also|Tomb of Genghis Khan|List of Mongol rulers}}\nGenghis Khan died within eight days of setting off for his final campaign against the [[Western Xia]] on 18 August 1227, according to the official ''History of Yuan'' commissioned during China's Ming dynasty.<ref name=Cho21>{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/genghis-khan-death-cause-revealed.html |title=The story you heard about Genghis Khan's death is probably all wrong |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=3 February 2021 |publisher=Live Science}}</ref> The date of his death is therefore said to have fallen on 25 August 1227, during the fall of [[Yinchuan]].

According to legend, the funeral escort killed anyone and anything across their path to conceal where he was finally buried. The [[Genghis Khan Mausoleum]], constructed many years after his death, is his memorial, but not his burial site.\n\nBefore Genghis Khan died, he assigned [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] as his successor. Genghis Khan left behind an army of more than 129,000 men; 28,000 were given to his various brothers and his sons. Tolui, his youngest son, inherited more than 100,000 men. This force contained the bulk of the elite Mongolian [[cavalry]]. By tradition, the youngest son inherits his father's property. [[Jochi]], [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatai]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], and Kulan's son Gelejian received armies of 4,000 men each. His mother and the descendants of his three brothers received 3,000 men each. The title of Great Khan passed to [[\u00d6gedei]], the third son of Genghis Khan, making him the second Great Khan ([[Khagan]]) of the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan's eldest son, Jochi, died in 1226, during his father's lifetime. Chagatai, Genghis Khan's second son was meanwhile passed over, according to ''The Secret History of the Mongols'', over a row just before the invasion of the [[Khwarezmid Empire]] in which Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khan's successor due to questions about his elder brother's parentage.

Many of the empire's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves ''Mongols'' in military and civilian life, including the [[Mongols|Mongol]] people, [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples, and others. There were [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of various non-Mongolian ethnicities such as [[Muhammad Khan (Ilkhan)|Muhammad Khan]].\n\nThere were tax exemptions for religious figures and, to some extent, teachers and doctors. The Mongol Empire practiced [[religious tolerance]] because Mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept, and not subject to law or interference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Amy Chua |title=Day of Empire: How hyperpowers rise to global dominance, and why they fall |place=New York |publisher=Random House |year=2007 |page=95}}</ref> Genghis Khan was a [[Tengrist]], but was [[Religious tolerance|religiously tolerant]] and interested in learning philosophical and moral lessons from other religions.

Modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the [[Pax Mongolica]] (Mongol Peace).\n\nGenghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him. He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities. For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a [[Khitan people|Khitan]] prince, [[Yel\u00fc Chucai|Chu'Tsai]], who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated. Jin had risen to power by displacing the Khitan people. Genghis told Chu'Tsai, who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers, that he had avenged Chu'Tsai's forefathers. Chu'Tsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he; also he did not consider his own father his enemy, so the question of revenge did not apply. This reply impressed Genghis Khan. Chu'Tsai administered parts of the Mongol Empire and became a confidant of the successive Mongol Khans.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}\n[[File:Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit, Tech Museum San Jose, 2010.jpg|thumb|Mural of siege warfare, Genghis Khan Exhibit in San Jose, California, US]]\n[[File:Mock Mongolian battle at Khaan Quest 07.jpg|thumb|Reenactment of Mongol battle]]\n\n=== Military ===\n{{Main|Mongol military tactics and organization}}\nGenghis Khan put absolute trust in his generals, such as [[Muqali]], [[Jebe]], and [[Subutai]], and regarded them as close advisors, often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members. He allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the Mongol Empire capital [[Karakorum]]. Muqali, a trusted lieutenant, was given command of the Mongol forces against the Jin dynasty while Genghis Khan was fighting in Central Asia, and [[Subutai]] and [[Jebe]] were allowed to pursue the Great Raid into the Caucasus and [[Kievan Rus']], an idea they had presented to the Khagan on their own initiative. While granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions, Genghis Khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them.\n\nThe Mongol military was also successful in [[siege warfare]], cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers, taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army, <!--Ratchnevsky, Grousset, Hartog, Morgan, will add ref--> and adopting new ideas, techniques and tools from the people they conquered, particularly in employing Muslim and Chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the Mongol cavalry in capturing cities. Another standard [[military tactics|tactic]] of the Mongol military was the commonly practiced [[Withdrawal (military)|feigned retreat]] to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for [[ambush]] and [[counterattack]].\n\nAnother important aspect of the military organization of Genghis Khan was the [[transport|communications]] and [[Materiel|supply]] route or ''[[Yam (route)|Yam]]'', adapted from previous Chinese models. Genghis Khan dedicated special attention to this in order to speed up the gathering of [[military intelligence]] and official communications.
