Davis''' (June 3, 1808{{snd}}December 6, 1889) was an American politician who served as the [[President of the Confederate States of America|president of the Confederate States]] from 1861 to 1865. He represented [[Mississippi]] in the [[United States Senate]] and the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] before the [[American Civil War]]. He had previously served as the [[United States Secretary of War]] from 1853 to 1857 under President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nDavis, the youngest of ten children, was born in [[Fairview, Kentucky]] to a moderately prosperous farmer couple. He grew up in [[Wilkinson County, Mississippi]], and also lived in [[Louisiana]]. His eldest brother [[Joseph Emory Davis]] secured the younger Davis's appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]]. After graduating, Jefferson Davis served six years as a lieutenant in the [[United States Army]]. He fought in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848) as the colonel of a volunteer regiment. Before the American Civil War, he operated in Mississippi a large cotton plantation which his brother Joseph had given him, and owned as many as 113 slaves. Although Davis argued against [[Secession in the United States|secession]] in 1858, he believed the states had an unquestionable right to leave the [[United States|Union]].\n\nDavis married [[Sarah Knox Taylor]], daughter of general and future President [[Zachary Taylor]], in 1835, when he was 27 years old. They were both soon stricken with [[malaria]], and Sarah died after three months of marriage. Davis recovered slowly and suffered from recurring bouts of illness throughout the rest of his life. At the age of 36, Davis married again, to 18-year-old [[Varina Davis|Varina Howell]], a native of [[Natchez, Mississippi]]. They had six children. Only two survived him, and only one married and had children.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Davis guided Confederate policy and served as its commander in chief. When the Confederacy was defeated in 1865, Davis was captured, accused of [[Treason#United States|treason]], and imprisoned at [[Fort Monroe]] in Hampton, Virginia. He was never tried and was released after two years. Davis's legacy is intertwined with his role as President of the Confederacy. Immediately after the war, he was often blamed for the Confederacy's loss. After he was released, he was seen as a man who suffered unjustly for his commitment to the South, becoming a hero of the [[pseudohistorical]] [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]] during the post-[[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. In the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, his legacy as Confederate leader was celebrated and memorialized in the South. In the twenty-first century, he is frequently criticized as supporter of slavery and racism, and a number of the memorials created in his honor throughout the country have been removed.\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth and family background===\nJefferson F.{{efn| Davis used the initial F., but there is no direct evidence what his middle name was.

Less than a year later, they moved to a farm near [[Woodville, Mississippi]], where Samuel began cultivating cotton and gradually increased the number of slaves he owned from six in 1810 to twelve.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=12\u201314}} He worked in the fields with his slaves, and eventually built a fine house, which Jane called [[Rosemont (Woodville, Mississippi)|Rosemont]].{{sfn|Eaton|1977|p=4}} During the [[War of 1812]], three of Davis's brothers went off to serve in the military.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=7}} When Davis was around five, he received a rudimentary education at a small schoolhouse near Woodville.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=15}} When he was about eight, his father sent him away with a party consisting of Major Thomas Hinds and his relatives to attend [[St. Rose Priory|Saint Thomas College]], a Catholic preparatory school run by [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] near [[Springfield, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=17}} In 1818, Davis returned to Mississippi, where he briefly studied at [[Jefferson College (Mississippi)|Jefferson College]] in [[Washington, Mississippi|Washington]]. He then attended the Wilkinson County Academy near Woodville for five years.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=15}} In 1823, Davis attended [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=23\u201324}} While he was still in college in 1824, he learned that his father Samuel had died. Before his death, Samuel had been in debt and had sold Rosemont and his slaves to his eldest son [[Joseph Emory Davis]], who already owned a large plantation along the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Davis Bend, Mississippi]].{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=23\u201324}}\n\n===West Point and early military career===\nDavis's oldest brother Joseph, who was 23 years older than him,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=8}} took on the role of being his surrogate father.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=17}} Joseph got Davis appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point in 1824. He became friends with his classmates, [[Albert Sidney Johnson]] and [[Leonidas Polk]].{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1p=39|Fleming|1920|p=146}} During his time there, he frequently challenged the academy's discipline.{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1p=33|Davis|1991|2pp=28\u201329}} In his first year, he was court-martialed for drinking at a nearby tavern; he was found guilty but was pardoned.{{sfn|Woodworth|1990|p=4}} In the following year, Davis was placed under house arrest for his role in the [[Eggnog Riot]] during Christmas 1826, in which students defied the discipline of superintendent [[Sylvanus Thayer]] by getting drunk and disorderly, but was not dismissed.{{sfn|Crackel|2002|p=88}} He graduated 23rd in a class of 33.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=57}}\n\nFollowing his graduation, Second Lieutenant Davis was assigned to the [[1st Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Infantry Regiment]]. In spring 1829, he was stationed at Forts [[Fort Crawford|Crawford]] and [[Fort Winnebago|Winnebago]] in [[Michigan Territory]] under the command of Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]],{{sfn|Scanlan|1940|p=175}} who would later become [[president of the United States]]. While serving in the military, Davis brought James Pemberton, an enslaved [[African-American]] that he an inherited from his father, with him as his personal servant.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=49}} The northern winters were unkind to Davis's health, and one winter he developed a bad case of [[pneumonia]]. After his bout with this lung infection, he was vulnerable to catching colds and [[bronchitis]].{{sfn|Woodworth|1990|p=6}} Davis went to Mississippi on furlough in March 1832, missing the outbreak of the [[Black Hawk War]]. Davis returned after the capture of [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] and escorted him for detention in St. Louis.{{sfn|Scanlan|1940|p=178\u2013179}} In his autobiography, Black Hawk stated that Jefferson treated him with kindness.{{sfn|Black Hawk|1882|p=112}}\n\nAfter his return to Fort Crawford in January 1833, he and Taylor's daughter, Sarah, had become romantically involved. Davis asked Taylor if he could marry Sarah, but Taylor refused.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=51\u201352}} In spring, Taylor had him assigned to the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)#Formation|United States Regiment of Dragoons]] under Colonel [[Henry Dodge]]. Davis was promoted to first lieutenant and deployed at [[Fort Gibson]], [[Arkansas Territory]].{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=55\u201356}} In February 1835, he was [[court-martialed]] for insubordination.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=68\u201369}} Davis was acquitted, but in the meantime he had requested a furlough. Immediately after his furlough, he tendered his resignation, which was effective on June 30. He was twenty-six years old.{{sfn|Eaton|1977|p=19}}\n\n==Planting career and first marriage==\n[[File:Jefferson Davis Miniature2.png|thumb|Miniature of Davis around age 32 ({{circa}} 1840)|alt=man looking left, tree in lower background behind him]]\nWhen Davis returned to Mississippi he decided to become a planter.{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1p=68|Davis|1991|2p=71|Eaton|1977|3p=20}} His brother Joseph was successfully converting his large holdings at Davis Bend, about {{Convert|15|mi|km|abbr=}} south of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], into [[Hurricane Plantation]], which would eventually have {{convert |1700|acre}} of cultivated fields and over 300 slaves.{{sfn|Hermann|1990|pp=49\u201354}} He gave Davis {{convert |800|acre}} of his land to start a plantation at Davis Bend and begin his career as a planter, though Joseph retained the title to the property. He also loaned Davis the money to buy ten slaves to clear and cultivate the land, which Jefferson would name [[Brierfield Plantation]].{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=71\u201373}}\n\nDavis had continued his correspondence with Sarah.{{sfn|Eaton|1977|pp=21\u201322}} They agreed to marry, and Taylor gave his implicit assent. Sarah went to Louisville where she had relatives, and Davis traveled on his own to meet her there. They married at [[Beechland (Jeffersontown, Kentucky)|Beechland]] on June 17, 1835.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=72}} In August, Davis and Sarah traveled south to [[Locust Grove State Historic Site|Locust Grove Plantation]], his sister Anna Smith's home in [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]]. Within days, both became severely ill with [[malaria]]. Sarah died at the age of 21 on September 15, 1835. They had been married only three months.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=70\u201372}} Davis gradually improved, and briefly traveled to [[Havana, Cuba]] to restore his health and returned home via New York and Washington, D.C., where he visited his old schoolmate from Transylvania College, [[George Wallace Jones]].{{sfn|Eaton|1977|p=23}}\n\nFor several years following Sarah's death, Davis spent much of his time at Brierfield supervising the enslaved workers who cleared the land and developing his plantation. By 1836, he possessed 23 slaves;{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=77}} by 1840, he possessed 40;{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=89}} and by 1860, 113.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=229}} He made his first slave, James Pemberton, its overseer,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=80}} a position he held until his death around 1850.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=229}} Meanwhile, Davis also developed intellectually. Joseph maintained a large library on Hurricane Plantation, allowing Davis to read up on politics, the law, and economics.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=83\u201385}} Joseph, who became particularly concerned with national attempts to limit slavery in new territories during this time, often served as Davis's advisor and facilitator as they increasingly became involved in politics,{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1pp=84\u201386|Davis|1991|2pp=90\u201392|Hermann|1990|3p=91}} and Jefferson was the beneficiary of his brother's political influence.{{sfn|Woodworth|1990|p=4}}\n\n==Early political career and second marriage==\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14759727081) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Wedding photograph (a [[daguerrotype]]) of Jefferson Davis and Varina Howell (1845)|alt=man on left with right hand on his hip; woman on right with both hands in her lap]]\nDavis first became directly involved in politics in 1840 when he attended a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] meeting in Vicksburg and served as a delegate to the party's state convention in [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]]; he served again in 1842.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=86}} In November 1843, he was chosen to be the Democratic candidate for the state House of Representatives for [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]] less than one week before the election after the original candidate withdrew his nomination; Davis lost the election.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=93\u201394}}\n\nIn early 1844, Davis was chosen to serve as a delegate to the state convention again.

Davis preferred Calhoun because he advocated for southern interests including the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]], reduction of tariffs, and building naval defenses in southern ports,{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1p=99|Eaton|1977|2p=48}} but he actively campaigned for [[James K.

Davis countered that Congress should establish a territorial government for California, which would give Southerners the right to colonize the territory with their slaves as well. He suggested that extending the [[Missouri Compromise Line]], which defined which territories were open to slavery, to the Pacific was acceptable,{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=191\u2013192}} arguing that the region south of the line was favorable for the expansion of slavery.{{sfnm|Eaton|1977|1p=73|Maizlish|2018|2pp=[{{Google books|id=U7w-DwAAQBAJ|pg=PT72|plainurl=yes}} PT72\u2013PT73]}} He stated that not allowing slavery into the new territories would deny the political equality of Southerners,{{sfn|Cooper|2008|pp=92\u201393}} and that it would destroy the balance of power between Northern and Southern states in the Senate.{{sfn|Eaton|1977|p=71}}\n\nDavis continued to oppose the Compromise of 1850 after it passed.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=203}} In the autumn of 1851, he was nominated to run for governor of Mississippi on a states' rights platform against [[Henry Stuart Foote]], who had favored the compromise.

He deemphasized the role slavery played in the secession,{{sfn|Escott|1978|pp=44\u201345}} but asserted white citizens' right to have slaves without outside interference.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=83}}\n\nDavis had to create a government structure out of almost nothing.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=703}} At the beginning of the war, the Confederacy had no army, treasury, diplomatic missions, or bureaucracy.{{sfn|Cooper|Terrill|1991|p=358}} Davis quickly built a strong central government to address these problems. For instance, he created a Bureau of Ordnance and convinced [[Josiah Gorgas]] to be its head.{{sfn|Hattaway|Beringer|2002|p=45}} Gorgas successfully built an arms industry from the ground up,{{sfnm|1a1=Cooper|1a2=Terrill|1y=1991|1p=373|2a1=McPherson|2y=2014|2p=163}} building a network of government-supervised factories for war materials{{sfn|Roland|1991|p=106}} and using innovative measures to produce a stable supply of gunpowder.{{sfn|Hattaway|Beringer|2002|p=141}}\n\nThough he supported states' rights, Davis believed the constitution gave him the right to centralize authority to prosecute the war. Learning that the Confederacy's military facilities were controlled by the individual states, he worked with the Congress to bring them under national authority.{{sfn|Escott|1978|p=54\u201355}} He received authorization from Congress to suspend the [[habeas corpus|writ of habeas corpus]] when needed.{{sfn|McPherson|2014|pp=73\u201374}} Contrary to the desires of state governors who wanted their troops available for local defense, he intended to deploy military forces based on national need and was authorized to create a centralized army that could enlist volunteers directly.{{sfn|Escott|1978|p=55\u201357}} When the soldiers in the volunteer army seemed unwilling to re-enlist in 1862, Davis instituted the first [[Confederate Conscription Acts 1862\u20131864|conscription]] in American history.{{sfnm|Cooper|2008|1p=38|Roland|1991|2p=106}} He also challenged property rights. In 1864, he recommended a direct 5% tax on all property, both land and slaves,{{sfn|Hattaway|Beringer|2002|p=272\u2013273}} and implemented the impressment of supplies and slave labor for the military effort.{{sfnm|1a1=Escott|1y=2009|1pp=159\u2013156|2a1=Hattaway|2a2=Beringer|2y=2002|2p=47}} These policies made him unpopular with states' rights advocates and state governors, who saw him as creating the same kind of government they had seceded from.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=536}} In 1865, Davis's commitment to independence led him to compromise on slavery; he convinced Congress to pass a law that allowed African-Americans to earn their freedom by serving in the military, though it came too late to have an effect on the war.{{sfnm|Escott|2009|1pp=195\u2013196|McPherson|2014|2pp=234\u2013235}}\n\n====Foreign policy====\n[[File:Cotton is king.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Colorized political cartoon by Stimson & Co, (1861).

Diplomacy was primarily focused on getting recognition from Britain.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=11}} Davis was confident that Britain's and most other European nations' economic [[King Cotton|dependence on cotton]] from the South would quickly convince them to sign treaties with the Confederacy.{{sfnm|1a1=Hattaway|1a2=Beringer|1y=2002|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Hubbard|2y=1998|2p=23}} Cotton had made up 61% of the value of all U.S. exports. The South filled most of the European cloth industry's need for cheap imported raw cotton: 77% of Britain's, 90% of France's, 60% of the German states', and 92% of Russia's. Around 20% of British workers were employed in the industry and half of British exports were finished cotton goods.{{sfn|Beckert|2015|p=243}} Despite Britain's imperative need for cotton, the Confederacy was prepared to downplay the role of slavery as the [[British Empire]] had outlawed it in 1833.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=11}} One of Davis's first choices for envoy to Britain, [[William Lowndes Yancey|William Yancey]], was a poor one.{{sfn|Jones|2010|p=16}} He was a strong defender of slavery and had advocated for the return of the slave trade, creating the impression that he was impulsive and erratic.{{sfn|Hubbard|1998|p=30\u201331}} British opinion did not turn against the South in the first year of the war, but that was because the Union had initially failed to declare that abolition was a war goal.{{sfn|Lorimer|1976|p=406}}\n\nThere was no Southern consensus on how to use cotton to gain European support. Davis wanted to make the cotton available, but require the Europeans to obtain it by violating the [[Union blockade|blockade]] declared by the Union; Secretary of War Benjamin and Secretary of the Treasury Memminger wanted to export cotton to Europe and warehouse it there to use as credit; the majority of Congress wanted to [[cotton diplomacy|embargo cotton]] until Europe was coerced to help the South.{{sfn|Hubbard|1998|p=25\u201326}} Davis did not allow an outright [[embargo]]; he thought it might push Britain and France away.

Though the provisional Congress levied a war tax of one-half of one percent on all property, including slaves, the government lacked the apparatus to efficiently collect it. The adoption of the [[Constitution of the Confederate States|Confederate Constitution]] prohibited further direct taxation on property.{{sfn|Ball|1991|p=202}} Instead, the Confederate government relied on printing [[Confederate States dollar|treasury notes]].

Initially, he was confined to a [[casemate]], forced to wear [[Legcuffs|fetters]] on his ankles, required to have guards constantly in his room, forbidden contact with his family, and given only a Bible and his prayerbook to read.{{sfn|Eckert|1987|pp=xxii\u2013xxiv}} Over time, his treatment improved: due to public outcry, the fetters were removed after five days; within two months, the guard was removed from his room, he was allowed to walk outside for exercise, and he was allowed to read newspapers and other books.{{sfn|Eckert|1987|pp=xxv\u2013xxvii}} In October, he was moved to better quarters.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=537}} In April 1866, Varina was permitted to regularly visit him. In September, Miles was replaced by General [[Henry S.

Davis threw himself into work, and he hired former friends to serve as agents, including Braxton Bragg. Davis lived at the [[Peabody Hotel]], leaving his family in England because he was not financially stable enough yet to provide them a home.

He also explored other possibilities of employment in France, but none worked out.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=559\u2013600}}\n\nAround this time, Davis took action to reclaim Brierfield.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=666}} After the war, Davis Bend had been taken over by the [[Freedmen's Bureau]] which employed former enslaved African Americans as laborers. Joseph had successfully applied for a pardon and was able to regain ownership of his land, including both Hurricane and Brierfield plantations.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=572\u2013573}} Unable to maintain the property, Joseph sold it to his former slave [[Ben Montgomery]] and his sons, [[Isaiah Montgomery|Isaiah]] and William.{{sfn|Hermann|1981|p=109}} When Joseph died in 1870, he made Davis one of his will's [[executors]], but his will did not specifically deed the land to Davis. Davis litigated to gain control of Brierfield,{{sfn|Hermann|1990|p=166}} and when a judge dismissed his suit in 1876, he appealed. In 1878, the Mississippi supreme court found in his favor. He then foreclosed on the Montgomerys who were in default on their mortgage and in December 1881, Brierfield was back in his hands,{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=628\u2013629}} although he did not live there again and it did not produce a reliable income.{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1pp=638\u2013641|Davis|1991|2pp=666, 682}}\n\nAfter returning from Europe in 1874, Davis continued to explore ways to make a living, including investments in railroads and mining in Arkansas and Texas,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=666}} and in building an ice-making machine.

Davis traveled through the South and Midwest, and in 1876, he and Varina again went to Europe.

He agreed, but insisted on paying board. He began writing his memoirs almost immediately.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=669}} Davis's desire to write a book showing the righteousness of his cause had begun taking tangible form in 1875, when he authorized William T. Walthall, a former Confederate officer and Carolina Life agent to find a publisher. Walthall worked out a contract with [[D. Appleton & Company]], according to which Walthall would get a monthly stipend for preparing the work for publication and Davis would receive the royalties for the completed book. The deadline for the contract was July 1878.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=669}} As he worked on his book, Davis occasionally agreed to speaking engagements. In his speeches, which were to veterans of the Mexican-American War or Confederate veterans, he defended the right of secession, attacked Reconstruction, and promoted national reconciliation.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=21}}\n\nWhen Davis began writing at Beauvoir, he and Varina lived separately. When Varina came back to the United States, she initially refused to come to Beauvoir because she did not like Davis's close relationship with Dorsey, who was serving as his [[amanuensis]]. In the summer of 1878, Varina relented, moving to Beauvoir and taking over the role of being Davis's assistant.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=612\u2013613}} Dorsey died in July 1879, and left Beauvoir to Davis in her will, providing him with a permanent home until the end of his life.{{sfn|Muldowny|1969|p=23}}\nIn 1878, Davis missed the deadline to complete his work, and eventually Appleton intervened directly. Walthall was dismissed and the company hired [[William J. Tenney]], who was experienced with getting manuscripts into publishable condition. In 1881, Davis and Tenney were able to publish the two volumes of ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government]]''.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=673\u2013676}} The book was intended as a vindication of Davis's actions, reiterating that the South had acted constitutionally in seceding from the Union and that the North was wrong for prosecuting an unjust, destructive war; additionally it explicitly downplayed slavery's role in the origins of the Civil War.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=619\u2013621}}\n\n[[File:Jefferson Davis, seated, facing front, during portrait session at Davis' home Beauvoir, near Biloxi, Mississippi LCCN2009633710.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Jefferson Davis at his home in [[Beauvoir (Biloxi, Mississippi)|Beauvoir]] by [[Edward Livingston Wilson|Edward Wilson]] ({{circa|1885}})|alt=bearded man looking forward with shuttered window in background]]\nIn the 1870s, Davis was invited to become a member of the [[Southern Historical Society]], an organization founded by Reverend [[J.

Early]] as its president.{{sfn|Starnes|1996|p=179}} The society was devoted to presenting the [[Lost Cause]] explanation of the Civil War: the South was morally and constitutionally right to secede from the Union, Confederate military leaders and soldiers, who fought to free themselves from Northern tyranny, were superior to the Union's soldiers; and the South only lost because of treachery, and the superiority of Union resources.{{sfn|Starnes|1996|pp=177\u2013181}} Davis became a life-time member, and appreciated the society as a depository of information on the Confederate States of America.{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1pp=621\u2013622|Starnes|1996|2p=188}} Early works about the Lost Cause had scapegoated political leaders like Davis for losing the war,{{sfn|Starnes|1996|p=178}} but the society shifted the blame for the South's defeat to the former Confederate general [[James Longstreet]], particularly for his performance at the Battle of Gettysburg.{{sfn|Starnes|1996|pp=186\u2013188}} Davis generally avoided public disputes regarding who was to blame for the Confederacy's defeat, but he did defend himself when [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] accused him of plotting not for secession, but to rule all the United States. He also responded in a personal letter to [[Theodore Roosevelt]] when the future president accused him of being a traitor like [[Benedict Arnold]]. Davis publicly maintained that he had done nothing wrong and that he had always upheld the Constitution.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=680\u2013681}}\n\nDavis spent most of his final years at Beauvoir.{{sfn|Muldowny|1969|p=23}} In 1886, [[Henry W.

Hill]] in Savannah and the Revolutionary War hero [[Nathanael Greene]] in Atlanta.{{sfn|Collins|2005|pp=26\u201327}} The tour was a triumph for Davis, and got extensive newspaper coverage, which emphasized national unity and the South's role as a permanent part of the United States. At each city and on stops along the way, large crowds came out to cheer Davis, solidifying his image as an icon of the Old South and the Confederate cause, and making him into a symbol for the New South.{{sfn|Muldowny|1969|p=31}} In October 1887, Davis participated in his last tour, traveling to the Georgia State Fair in [[Macon, Georgia]] for a grand reunion with Confederate veterans. He also continued writing. In the summer of 1888, he was encouraged by [[James Redpath]], editor of the ''[[North American Review]]'', to write a series of articles.{{sfnm|Collins|2005|1p=49|Cooper|2000|2p=644}} Redpath's encouragement also helped Davis to completed his final book ''[[A Short History of the Confederate States of America]]'' in October 1889;{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=682}} he also began dictating his memoirs, although they were never finished.{{sfnm|Cooper|2000|1p=645|Davis|1991|2p=683}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:JeffDavisFuneralOnCampStreet1889.jpg|thumb|Funeral procession of Jefferson Davis in [[New Orleans]](1889)|alt=city street view from above, street seen diagonally from lower left to upper right, crowds of people line the street, horses, carriages and people march along it]]\nOn November 1889, Davis left Beauvoir and embarked on a steamboat in New Orleans in a cold rain to visit his Brierfield plantation. He fell ill during the trip, but refused to send for a doctor. An employee at Brierfield telegrammed Varina, who took a northbound steamer from New Orleans and transferred to his vessel mid-river. He finally got medical care and was diagnosed with acute bronchitis complicated by malaria.{{sfn|Collins|2005|pp=50\u201351}} When he returned to New Orleans, Davis's doctor Stanford E.

Davis remained bedridden but stable for the next two weeks. He took a turn for the worse in early December, and died at 12:45{{nbs}}a.m. on Friday, December 6, 1889, in the presence of several friends and holding Varina's hand.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|pp=652\u2013654}}\n\n===Funeral and reburial===\n{{also see|Funeral and Burials of Jefferson Davis}}\nDavis's body lay in state at the [[Gallier Hall|New Orleans City Hall]] from December 7 to 11.
