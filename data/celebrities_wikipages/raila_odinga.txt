Odinga and other KANU members, including [[Kalonzo Musyoka]], [[George Saitoti]] and [[Joseph Kamotho]], opposed this step arguing that the then 38-year-old Uhuru was politically inexperienced and lacked the leadership qualities needed to govern. Moi stood his ground, maintaining that the country's leadership needed to pass to the younger generation.\n\nDissent ran through the party with some members openly disagreeing with Moi, despite his reputation as an autocrat. It was then that the Rainbow Movement was founded, comprising disgruntled KANU members who exited KANU. The exodus, led by Odinga, saw most big names fleeing the party. Moi was left with his handpicked successor almost alone with a party reduced to an empty shell with poor electoral prospects. The Rainbow Movement went on to join the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP), which later teamed up with opposition Mwai Kibaki's [[National Alliance Party of Kenya]] (NAK), a coalition of several other parties, to form the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] ([[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]]).\n\n===National Rainbow Coalition (NARC)===\nAmid fears that this opposition \"super alliance\" would fail to unite and rally behind a common candidate as in previous occasions and thus easily hand victory to the government, Odinga declared \"''Kibaki tosha''\", Swahili for \"Kibaki is sufficient\", an endorsement of a Kibaki ticket. This resolved the matter of candidacy and Narc went on to defeat Moi's protege, [[Uhuru Kenyatta]]. The opposition won a landslide 67% of the vote, dealing a humiliating blow to Moi. Odinga led the campaign for Kibaki throughout the country while Kibaki was bedridden and incapacitated following an accident while on his way back to Nairobi from a campaign meeting at [[Machakos]] junction 40 kilometres (25 miles) from [[Nairobi]] in which he sustained injuries.\n\n===NARC MOU===\n[[File:Gordon Brown Raila Odinga.JPG|thumb|Odinga with [[Gordon Brown]] at [[Kibera]]]]\nOn assuming office, President Kibaki did not appoint Odinga as Prime Minister in the new government, contrary to a pre-election Memorandum Of Understanding. (Kenya's constitution had no provision for Prime minister yet); neither did he give LDP (Odinga's faction) half of the cabinet positions as per the MOU. He instead sought to entrench and increase his own NAK's side in cabinet, even appointing MPs from the opposition parties (KANU and FORD people) to the cabinet.<ref>BBC News, 30 September 2003: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3356431.stm Uproar over Kenya leader's decree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040720215552/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3356431.stm |date=20 July 2004 }}</ref>\n\nThe perceived \"betrayal\" started a simmering disquiet which in time led to an open rebellion and a split within the cabinet. A key point of disagreement was a proposed new constitution for the country, which was a major campaign issue that had united Kibaki's NAK and Odinga's LDP in the campaign. This constitution included provisions to trim presidential powers to rein in what was seen as an autocratic presidency, a feature of both the Moi and first president Jomo Kenyatta's regimes which had led to a lot of power abuse and an unaccountable leadership.\n\n===2005 referendum===\nOnce in power however, Kibaki's government instituted a Constitutional Committee which turned around and submitted a draft constitution that was perceived to consolidate presidential powers and weaken regional governments, contrary to the pre-election draft.\n\nOdinga opposed this and went on to campaign with his LDP cabinet colleagues on the referendum 'No' side, opposing the president and his lieutenants in a bruising countrywide campaign. When the document was put to a [[2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum|referendum]] on 21 November 2005, the government lost by a 57% to 43% margin. Embarrassingly for Kibaki, out of 8 provinces, only one (Central Province where his tribe the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] are dominant) voted \"yes\" for the document, isolating his own tribe from the rest of Kenya and exposing his campaign as ethnic-based.\n\nA shell-shocked and disappointed President Kibaki sacked the entire cabinet on 23 November 2005. When it was reconstituted two weeks later, Odinga and the entire LDP group were left out.\n\n===Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)===\nOdinga led the formation of a new opposition outfit, the [[Orange Democratic Movement|Orange Democratic Movement (ODM)]] \u2013 an Orange was the symbol for the \"No\" vote in the constitutional referendum.\nIn January 2006, Odinga was reported to have told police that he believed his life was in danger, having received assassination threats.<ref>BBC News, 10 January 2006: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4599834.stm Kenyan opponent 'fears for life'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113105542/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4599834.stm |date=13 January 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== The Unconstitutional Swearing in as People's President ===\nHaving lost the 2017 election to Uhuru Kenyatta<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kenya's 2017 presidential elections: a preliminary results analysis, by county - Africa Research Institute |url=https://www.africaresearchinstitute.org/newsite/blog/kenyas-2017-elections-preliminary-results-analysis-county/ |access-date=2022-12-08 |website=www.africaresearchinstitute.org |language=en-US}}</ref> and boycotted the rerun,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-10-10 |title=Kenya: Raila Odinga withdraws from election rerun |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/10/kenya-raila-odinga-withdraws-election |access-date=2022-12-08 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> Odinga had himself sworn in as \"the people's president\".<ref>{{Citation |title=\ud83c\uddf0\ud83c\uddea Kenya's Raila Odinga self-sworn in as 'people's president' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfwlzatmUXI |language=en |access-date=2022-12-08}}</ref> [[Miguna Miguna]], who administered the oath, was deported, while Odinga faced no consequences.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2018-02-07 |title=Kenya deports Miguna Miguna over Odinga 'swearing-in' |language=en-GB |work=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42973169 |access-date=2022-12-08}}</ref> He went on to have a handshake and take part in government decision making.\n\n=== The handshake ===\nIn March 2018, Raila and Uhuru had a political handshake intended to cool the political temperatures after the 2017 general elections.

As such, he proved the votes were not real votes cast by human voters but the outcome of a computer generated formula producing artificial values. This intrusion into IEBC's system, he further said, affected not just the presidential results but the entire election, including the votes cast for MPs, senators, governors and women representatives. He called the alleged intrusion \"the biggest vote theft in Kenya's history\". Later while vote tallying was still in progress and the country was awaiting the announcement of the final results, Odinga revealed that his team had received information from a confidential source in IEBC indicating that results from its server showed him leading with an unassailable 8 million votes over Uhuru's 7&nbsp;million votes. Based on this, he demanded he be declared the fifth [[president of Kenya]].\n\nThe IEBC however rejected Odinga's contention, saying the winner could not be announced before the tallying was complete and also being an independent body it could not be compelled by one of the candidates to announce the results.\n\nThe IEBC finally announced the results declaring Uhuru the winner with 8.2&nbsp;million votes against Odinga's 6.7&nbsp;million. The results showed massive losses for NASA, with Jubilee invading traditional NASA strongholds. NASA refused to recognize the results.\n\nShortly after Uhuru's declared victory, violence was reported in some parts of the country which are opposition strongholds. However the violence was not of the scale witnessed in the 2007 election aftermath and broke out only sporadically. Both Odinga and President Kenyatta called for public calm.\n\n====Annulment of the presidential election====\nAfter initially declining to take his case to court on the grounds that the court had previously made an unfavourable judgment against him, Odinga reconsidered and lodged a petition.\n\nAfter 2 days of hearings, the judges in a majority 4\u20132 decision returned a verdict on 1 September annulling the presidential results and ordered a new election to be held within 60 days. The court decision, read by Chief Justice David Maraga and widely viewed as unprecedented both in Africa and globally, held that the IEBC failed to conduct the election in the manner provided by the Constitution and so could not stand.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Freytas-Tamura|first1=Kimiko|title=Kenya Supreme Court Nullifies Presidential Election|website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/world/africa/kenya-election-kenyatta-odinga.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901210458/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/world/africa/kenya-election-kenyatta-odinga.html?_r=0|archive-date=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Supreme Court ruling, Odinga announced his withdrawal from the presidential election, scheduled for 26 October,<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Raila Odinga takes a gamble by threatening to boycott Kenya's election|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730121-first-poll-was-annulled-second-may-be-violently-disrupted-raila-odinga|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=11 October 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012061227/https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21730121-first-poll-was-annulled-second-may-be-violently-disrupted-raila-odinga|archive-date=12 October 2017}}</ref> on 10 October.<ref name=odingwithd>{{cite web |title=I will not be forced to participate in election re-run, says Raila Odinga |url=http://www.ntv.co.ug/news/international/10/oct/2017/i-will-not-be-forced-participate-election-re-run-says-raila-odinga |website=www.ntv.co.ug |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010142116/http://www.ntv.co.ug/news/international/10/oct/2017/i-will-not-be-forced-participate-election-re-run-says-raila-odinga |archive-date=2017-10-10}}</ref> The reason for his withdrawal was his belief that the election would again not be free or fair, since no electoral process reforms had been made since the annulment of the last election,<ref name=\"veconomist\" /> as well as various defections which occurred from his coalition.<ref name=odingwithd />\n\nThe IEBC later stated that Odinga had not officially withdrawn from the race for presidency and his name would still appear on the ballot on 26 October among other candidates who contested the 8th August General Elections.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/iebc-raila-not-withdrawn-presidential-race/|title=IEBC: Raila has not withdrawn from presidential race \u2013 Nairobi News|date=11 October 2017|work=Nairobi News|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012203220/http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/news/iebc-raila-not-withdrawn-presidential-race/|archive-date=12 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThis resulted in violent uproar in various parts of the country some few days before and after the repeat polls especially in the NASA dominated zones.

His position was once in favour of a parliamentary system as seen when he initially backed a Constitution giving executive powers to a Prime Minister, but he subsequently changed to support a presidential system with a devolved power structure, which is reflected in Kenya's current constitution.\n\nAmong others, Odinga is seen as one of the main forces behind the devolution now enshrined in Kenya's constitution as an essential part of Kenya's governance system. This was inspired by a feeling that all successive governments under the centralized power structure had consistently abused that power to favour certain areas along political or ethnic lines while denying many regions access to resources and development because of their ethnicity or perceived disloyalty. Devolution aimed to address this and guarantee regions their fair share of resources regardless of their political affiliation or ethnicity.\n\nDue to an economic downturn and extreme [[Drought in Kenya|drought]], Odinga has called for the suspension of taxes on fuels and certain foods that disproportionately impact the poor.<ref>Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, 1 June 2011: [http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70521 Principles Unite in Addressing High Cost of Living] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321070428/http://www.kbc.co.ke/news.asp?nid=70521 |date=21 March 2012 }}</ref> Odinga has supported an element of state welfare in the form of [[Cash Transfer Programming|cash-transfer programs]] to low-income people. This is currently implemented but in a limited way to poor, elderly people.\n\nNevertheless, on social issues, Odinga has taken a more conservative line. On [[LGBT rights in Kenya|LGBT]] issues, Odinga stated that \"the [[Constitution of Kenya|constitution]] is very clear on this issue and men or women found engaging in homosexuality will not be spared\", adding that \"If we find a man engaging in homosexuality or a woman in lesbianism, we'll arrest them and put them in jail\". These comments were widely condemned from LGBT activists, who stated that his rhetoric put the lives of LGBT Kenyans in danger.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gay, lesbian groups criticize Kenyan leader's remarks|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/11/30/kenya.gay.reaction/index.html|access-date=2021-10-28|website=CNN|language=en}}</ref> In response, his office walked back Odinga's statement, claiming he only meant to clarify that same-sex marriage is illegal under the constitution.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Fight for LGBT Rights in Kenya|url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/fight-lgbt-rights-kenya|access-date=2021-10-28|website=www.opensocietyfoundations.org|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Foreign Office Minister Henry Bellingham meeting Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga in London, 7 July 2011.
