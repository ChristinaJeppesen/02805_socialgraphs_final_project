Considered a [[Cthulhu Mythos deities#Great Old Ones|Great Old One]] within the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous popular culture references. Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in the shape of a green [[octopus]], [[dragon]], and a [[caricature]] of human form. The Lovecraft-inspired universe, the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], where it exists with its fellow entities, is named after it.\n\n==Etymology, spelling, and pronunciation==\nInvented by Lovecraft in 1928, the name Cthulhu was probably chosen to echo the word ''[[chthonic]]'' (Ancient Greek \"of the earth\"), as apparently suggested by Lovecraft himself at the end of his 1923 tale \"[[The Rats in the Walls]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = H.

The 'u' is about like that in 'full', and the first syllable is not unlike 'klul' in sound, hence the 'h' represents the guttural thickness\"<ref>{{cite book| first= H.

P. Lovecraft describes a statue of Cthulhu as: \"A monster of vaguely anthropoid outline, but with an octopus-like head whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.\"<ref name=\"call\">[[s:The Call of Cthulhu]]</ref> \n\nCthulhu is said to resemble a green octopus, dragon, and a human caricature, hundreds of meters tall, with webbed, human-looking arms and legs and a pair of rudimentary wings on its back.<ref name=\"call\" /> Its head is depicted as similar to the entirety of a [[gigantic octopus]], with an unknown number of tentacles surrounding its supposed mouth.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe short story that first mentions Cthulhu, \"The Call of Cthulhu\", was published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in 1928, and established the character as a malevolent entity, hibernating within [[R'lyeh]], an underwater city in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. The imprisoned Cthulhu is apparently the source of constant subconscious anxiety for all mankind, and is also the object of worship, both by many human cults (including some within [[New Zealand]], [[Greenland]], [[Louisiana]], and the [[List of mountains in China|Chinese mountains]]) and by other Lovecraftian monsters (called [[Deep Ones]]<ref name=\"innsmouth\">[[s:The Shadow Over Innsmouth]]</ref> and [[Mi-Go]]<ref name=\"darkness\">[[s:The Whisperer in Darkness]]</ref>). The short story asserts the premise that, while currently trapped, Cthulhu will eventually return. His worshippers chant \"''Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn''{{-\"}} (\"In his house at ''R'lyeh'', dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\")<ref name=\"call\" />\n\n[[File:H. P.

In 1937, Derleth wrote the short story \"The Return of Hastur\", and proposed two groups of opposed cosmic entities:\n\n{{quote| the Old or Ancient Ones, the ''[[Elder God (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Gods]]'', of ''cosmic good'', and those of ''cosmic evil'', bearing many names, and themselves of different groups, as if associated with the elements and yet transcending them: for there are the Water Beings, hidden in the depths; those of Air that are the primal lurkers beyond time; those of Earth, horrible animate survivors of distant eons.<ref name= Derleth>{{cite book| first= August| last= Derleth| chapter= The Return of Hastur| title= The Hastur Cycle| editor-first= Robert M. |editor-last= Price}}</ref>{{rp|256}}}}\n\nAccording to Derleth's scheme, \"Great Cthulhu is one of the Water Elementals\" and was engaged in an age-old arch-rivalry with a designated air elemental, [[Hastur|Hastur the Unspeakable]], described as Cthulhu's \"half-brother.\"<ref name= Derleth />{{rp|256, 266}} Based on this framework, Derleth wrote a series of short stories published in ''Weird Tales'' (1944\u20131952) and collected as ''[[The Trail of Cthulhu]]'', depicting the struggle of a Dr. Laban Shrewsbury and his associates against Cthulhu and his minions. In addition, Cthulhu is referenced in Derleth's 1945 novel ''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]'' published by [[Arkham House]]. The novel can also be found in ''[[The Watchers Out of Time and Others]]'', a collection of stories from Derleth's interpretations of Lovecraftian Mythos published by Arkham House in 1974.\n\nDerleth's interpretations have been criticized by Lovecraft enthusiast [[Michel Houellebecq]], among others. Houellebecq's ''[[H.&nbsp;P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life]]'' (2005) decries Derleth for attempting to reshape Lovecraft's strictly amoral continuity into a stereotypical conflict between forces of objective good and evil.<ref>{{cite book| last= Bloch| first= Robert| chapter= Heritage of Horror| title= The Best of H.

TSR, however, were unaware that [[Arkham House]], which asserted copyright on almost all Lovecraft literature, had already licensed the Cthulhu property to game company [[Chaosium]]. Although Chaosium stipulated that TSR could continue to use the material if each future edition featured a published credit to Chaosium, TSR refused and the material was removed from all subsequent editions.<ref name=\"acaeum\">{{cite web | url = http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/deities.html | title = Deities & Demigods, Legends & Lore | work = The Acaeum | access-date = 2010-05-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100903180904/http://www.acaeum.com/ddindexes/setpages/deities.html | archive-date = 2010-09-03 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\n===Politics===\n{{main|Cthulhu for President}}\n[[File:20100701 cthulhu poster.jpg|thumb|Poster from the [[2010 Polish presidential election]]: The caption translates as \"Choose the greater evil.
