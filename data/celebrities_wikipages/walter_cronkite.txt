Cronkite began working at WTOP-TV (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]), the CBS affiliate in Washington, D.C.. He originally served as anchor of the network's 15-minute late-Sunday-evening newscast ''Up To the Minute'', which followed ''[[What's My Line?]]'' at 11:00&nbsp;pm ET from 1951 through 1962.\n\nAlthough it was widely reported that the term \"[[News presenter#News anchors|anchor]]\" was coined to describe Cronkite's role at both the [[1952 Democratic National Convention|Democratic]] and [[1952 Republican National Convention|Republican]] National Conventions, marking the first nationally televised convention coverage, other news presenters bore the title before him.<ref name=OTM /> Cronkite anchored the network's coverage of the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]] as well as later conventions. In 1964 he was temporarily replaced by the team of [[Robert Trout]] and [[Roger Mudd]]; this proved to be a mistake, and Cronkite returned to the anchor chair for future political conventions.<ref>Brinkley, pp. 320\u2013321.</ref>\n\nFrom 1953 to 1957, Cronkite hosted the CBS program ''[[You Are There (series)|You Are There]]'', which reenacted historical events, using the format of a news report.<ref name=\"KTVN Channel 2\" /> His famous last line for these programs was: \"What sort of day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times ... and you were there.\" In 1971, the show was revived and redesigned to attract an audience of teenagers and young adults, hosted again by Cronkite on Saturday mornings.  In 1957, he began hosting ''The Twentieth Century'' (eventually renamed ''[[The 20th Century]]''), a documentary series about important historical events of the century composed almost exclusively of [[newsreel]] footage and interviews.  A long-running hit, the show was again renamed as ''The 21st Century'' in 1967 with Cronkite hosting speculative reporting on the future for another three years. Cronkite also hosted ''It's News to Me'', a game show based on news events.<ref name=\"NY times\" />\n\nDuring the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956 Cronkite hosted the CBS news-discussion series ''[[Pick the Winner]]''.\n\nAnother of his network assignments was ''The Morning Show'', CBS' short-lived challenge to [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' in 1954.<ref name=\"CBS Trusted\" /> His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion [[puppet]] named Charlemane about the news.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cronkite with Charlemane the Lion on CBS' ''The Morning Show'' (photograph)|work=CBS News|date=June 23, 2006|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2003/06/23/in_depth_showbiz/photoessay559943_1_9_photo.shtml?tag=page|access-date=August 2, 2009}}</ref> He considered this discourse with a puppet as \"one of the highlights\" of the show.

For much of the 1960s, ''The Huntley\u2013Brinkley Report'' had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of [[Assassination of John F.

Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the ''CBS Evening News'' began to surpass ''The Huntley\u2013Brinkley Report'' in viewership during the summer months.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nIn 1969, during the [[Apollo 11]] (with co-host and former astronaut [[Wally Schirra]]) and [[Apollo 13]] Moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions.<ref name=\"Barron\" /> In 1970, when Huntley retired, the ''CBS Evening News'' finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist [[John Chancellor]], Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981.<ref name=\"kansas\" />\n\nOne of Cronkite's trademarks was ending the ''CBS Evening News'' with the phrase \"...And that's the way it is,\" followed by the date.<ref name=\"KTVN Channel 2\" /> Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary.<ref name=\"kansas\" /> Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the [[Iran hostage crisis]], Cronkite added the length of the hostages' captivity to the show's closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981.<ref>''CBS News Transcripts, January 16, 1980''.</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/14/AR2009051403597.html|title=And That's the Way It Is \u2013 Or Is It?|last=Goodman|first=Ellen|date=June 17, 1980|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Historic moments==\n=== Kennedy's assassination ===\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2010}}\nCronkite is vividly remembered for breaking the news of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on Friday, November 22, 1963. Cronkite had been standing at the [[United Press International]] [[Teleprinter|wire machine]] in the CBS newsroom as the bulletin of the President's shooting broke and he clamored to get on the air to break the news as he wanted CBS to be the first network to do so.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daniel |first=Douglass K. |title=Harry Reasoner: a life in the news |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2007 |isbn= 978-0-292-71477-9 |format=digitised online by Google Books online |pages=87, 88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbyuBwKrDMC&q=harry+reasoner+lunch+cronkite&pg=PA88}}</ref>\n\nThere was a problem facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no television camera in the studio at the time, as the technical crew was working on it. Eventually, the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Secrets of the Dead'' season 13, episode 1: \"JFK: One PM Central Standard Time\".

The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera to see if they could get it set up quicker.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nMeanwhile, CBS was ten minutes into its live broadcast of the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]] (ATWT)'', which had begun at the very minute of the shooting. A \"CBS News Bulletin\" bumper slide abruptly broke into the broadcast at 1:40&nbsp;pm EST.

Stay tuned to CBS News for further details.<ref name=\"Cronkite Broadcasts\" />}}\n\nJust before the bulletin cut out, a CBS News staffer was heard saying \"Connally too,\" apparently having just heard the news that Texas Governor [[John Connally]] had also been shot while riding in the [[SS-100-X|presidential limousine]] with his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]] and Mr. and [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Mrs. Kennedy]].\n\nCBS then rejoined the telecast of ''ATWT'' during a commercial break, which was followed by show announcer Dan McCullough's usual fee plug for the first half of the program and the network's 1:45 pm station identification break. Just before the second half of ''ATWT'' was to begin, the network broke in with the bumper slide a second time. In this bulletin Cronkite reported in greater detail about the assassination attempt on the President, while also breaking the news of Governor Connally's shooting.\n\n{{blockquote|...President Kennedy was shot as he drove from Dallas Airport to downtown Dallas; Governor Connally of Texas, in the car with him, was also shot. It is reported that three bullets rang out. A Secret Service man has been...was heard to shout from the car, \"He's dead.\" Whether he referred to President Kennedy or not is not yet known. The President, cradled in the arms of his wife Mrs. Kennedy, was carried to an ambulance and the car rushed to Parkland Hospital outside Dallas, the President was taken to an emergency room in the hospital. Other White House officials were in doubt in the corridors of the hospital as to the condition of President Kennedy. Repeating this bulletin: President Kennedy shot while driving in an open car from the airport in Dallas, Texas, to downtown Dallas.<ref name=\"Cronkite Broadcasts\" />}}\n\nCronkite then recapped the events as they had happened: that the President and Governor Connally had been shot and were in the emergency room at [[Parkland Hospital]], and no one knew their condition as yet. CBS then decided to return to ''ATWT'', which was now midway through its second segment.\n\nThe cast had continued to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ''ATWT'' then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break would be the last anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy had been shot in the head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman [[Albert Thomas (American politician)|Albert Thomas]] that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> At 2:00 pm EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom.\n\nWithin twenty seconds of the announcement, every CBS affiliate except Dallas' [[KDFW|KRLD]] (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made on the life of the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.\n\nAfter several minutes, the coverage came back to the CBS newsroom where Cronkite reported that the President had been given blood transfusions and two priests had been called into the room. He also played an audio report from KRLD that someone had been arrested in the assassination attempt at the [[Texas School Book Depository]]. Back in Dallas Barker announced another report of the death of the President, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Before the network left KRLD's feed for good, Barker first announced, then retracted, a confirmation of Kennedy's death.\n\nCBS cut back to Cronkite reporting that one of the priests had administered last rites to the president. In the next few minutes, several more bulletins reporting that Kennedy had died were given to Cronkite, including one from CBS's own correspondent [[Dan Rather]] that had been reported as confirmation of Kennedy's demise by CBS Radio. As these bulletins came into the newsroom, it was becoming clearer that Kennedy had in fact lost his life. Cronkite, however, stressed that these bulletins were simply reports and not any official confirmation of the President's condition; some of his colleagues recounted in 2013 that his early career as a wire service reporter taught him to wait for official word before reporting a story.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Still, as more word came in, Cronkite seemed to be resigned to the fact that it was only a matter of time before the assassination was confirmed. He appeared to concede this when, several minutes after he received the Rather report, he received word that the two priests who gave the last rites to Kennedy told reporters on the scene that he was dead. Cronkite said that report \"seems to be as close to official as we can get\", but would not declare it as such. Nor did he do so with a report from Washington, DC that came moments later, which said that government sources were now reporting the President was dead (this information was passed on to ABC as well, which took it as official confirmation and reported it as such; NBC did not report this information at all and chose instead to rely on reports from Charles Murphy and Robert MacNeil to confirm their suspicions).\n\nAt 2:38 pm EST, while filling in time with some observations about the security presence in Dallas, which had been increased due to violent acts against [[United Nations]] [[Ambassador]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in the city earlier that year, Cronkite was handed a new bulletin. After looking it over for a moment, he took off his glasses, and made the official announcement:\n\n{{blockquote|From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: ''(reading AP flash)'' \"President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.\" ''(glancing up at clock)'' 2&nbsp;o'clock Eastern Standard Time, some 38 minutes ago.<ref name=\"Grzanich\">{{cite web |title=JFK Assassination (CBS Coverage) \u2013 Part 8/10 (1963) |work=CBS News |date=November 22, 1963 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzsYntj_YWk | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721071621/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzsYntj_YWk| archive-date=2010-07-21 | url-status=dead|access-date=August 2, 2012\n}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter making that announcement, Cronkite paused briefly, put his glasses back on, and swallowed hard to maintain his composure. With noticeable emotion in his voice he intoned the next sentence of the news report:<ref name=\"Grzanich\" />\n\n{{blockquote|Vice President Johnson ''(clears throat)'' has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded; presumably he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the 36th President of the United States.<ref name=\"Grzanich\" />}}\n\nWith emotion still in his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again recapped the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining the significance of the pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, and that there was no report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and left the room for a while.\n\nAt about 3:30&nbsp;pm EST, Cronkite came back into the newsroom to relay some new information. The two major pieces of information involved the Oath of Office being administered to now-President Johnson, which officially made him the thirty-sixth President, and that Dallas police had arrested a man named [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] whom they suspected had fired the fatal shots. After that, Cronkite left again to begin preparing for that night's ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', which he returned to anchor as normal. For the next four days, along with his colleagues, Cronkite continued to report segments of uninterrupted coverage of the assassination, including the announcement of Oswald's death in the hands of [[Jack Ruby]] on Sunday. The next day, on the day of the funeral, Cronkite concluded ''CBS Evening News'' with the following assessment about the events of the last four dark days:\n\n{{blockquote|It is said that the human mind has a greater capacity for remembering the pleasant than the unpleasant. But today was a day that will live in memory and in grief. Only history can write the importance of this day: Were these dark days the harbingers of even blacker ones to come, or like the black before the dawn shall they lead to some still as yet indiscernible sunrise of understanding among men, that violent words, no matter what their origin or motivation, can lead only to violent deeds? This is the larger question that will be answered, in part, in the manner that a shaken civilization seeks the answers to the immediate question: Who, and most importantly what, was Lee Harvey Oswald? The world's doubts must be put to rest. Tonight there will be few Americans who will go to bed without carrying with them the sense that somehow they have failed. If in the search of our conscience we find a new dedication to the American concepts that brought no political, sectional, religious or racial divisions, then maybe it may yet be possible to say that John Fitzgerald Kennedy did not die in vain. That's the way it is, Monday, November 25, 1963. This is Walter Cronkite, good night.<ref name=\"Cronkite Broadcasts\" />}}\n\nReferring to his coverage of Kennedy's assassination, in a 2006 TV interview with [[Nick Clooney]], Cronkite recalled,\n\n{{blockquote|I choked up, I really had a little trouble...my eyes got a little wet...[what Kennedy had represented] was just all lost to us.

They were invited to dine with General [[Creighton Abrams]], the commander of all forces in Vietnam, whom Cronkite knew from World War II. According to Leiser, Abrams told Cronkite, \"we cannot win this Goddamned war, and we ought to find a dignified way out.\"<ref name=\"Cronkite Tet\">{{Cite news |title=And That's The Way It Was...|work=Huffington Post |date=July 21, 2009 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/murray-fromson/and-thats-the-way-it-was_b_242398.html |access-date=December 4, 2009 |first=Murray |last=Fromson}}</ref>\n\nUpon return, Cronkite and Leiser wrote separate editorial reports based on that trip. Cronkite, an excellent writer, preferred Leiser's text over his own.<ref name=\"Cronkite Tet\"/> On February 27, 1968, Cronkite closed \"Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?\" with that editorial report:\n\n{{blockquote|We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders, both in Vietnam and Washington, to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds. They may be right, that Hanoi's winter-spring offensive has been forced by the Communist realization that they could not win the longer war of attrition, and that the Communists hope that any success in the offensive will improve their position for eventual negotiations. It would improve their position, and it would also require our realization, that we should have had all along, that any negotiations must be that \u2013 negotiations, not the dictation of peace terms. For it seems now more certain than ever that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate. This summer's almost certain standoff will either end in real give-and-take negotiations or terrible escalation; and for every means we have to escalate, the enemy can match us, and that applies to invasion of the North, the use of nuclear weapons, or the mere commitment of one hundred, or two hundred, or three hundred thousand more American troops to the battle. And with each escalation, the world comes closer to the brink of cosmic disaster.\n\nTo say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion. On the off chance that military and political analysts are right, in the next few months we must test the enemy's intentions, in case this is indeed his last big gasp before negotiations. But it is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.<ref>{{cite news|title=Who, What, When, Where, Why: Report from Vietnam by Walter Cronkite|date=February 27, 1968|publisher=[[CBS Evening News]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn4w-ud-TyE| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227183438/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn4w-ud-TyE&gl=US&hl=en| archive-date=2012-02-27 | url-status=dead|access-date=August 3, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Walter Cronkite In Vietnam2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cronkite reporting on location during the Vietnam War in 1968]]\n\nFollowing Cronkite's editorial report, President [[Lyndon B.

[[Ted Baxter]], who at first tried to convince Cronkite that he (Baxter) was as good a newsman as [[Eric Sevareid]], pleaded with Cronkite to hire him for the network news, at least to give sport scores, and gave an example: \"The [[Minnesota North Stars|North Stars]] 3, the [[Los Angeles Kings|Kings]] Oh!\" Cronkite turned to Grant and said, \"I'm gonna get you for this!\" Cronkite later said that he was disappointed that his scene was filmed in one take, since he had hoped to sit down and chat with the cast.\n\nIn the late 1980s and again in the 1990s, Cronkite appeared on the news-oriented situation comedy ''[[Murphy Brown]]'' as himself. Both episodes were written by the Emmy Award-winning team of Tom Seeley and Norm Gunzenhauser. He also continued hosting a variety of series.

In accepting the 1999 Norman Cousins Global Governance Award at the ceremony at the United Nations, Cronkite said:\n\n<blockquote>It seems to many of us that if we are to avoid the eventual catastrophic world conflict we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward a world government patterned after our own government with a legislature, executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its international laws and keep the peace. To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of courage, a lot of faith in the new order.

They pander to and are supported by the Christian Coalition and the rest of the religious right wing.

It is especially fitting that the archive documenting Walter's distinguished career should also include one of the moon rocks that the heroic astronauts of the Apollo program brought to Earth.\"<ref name=\"papers\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Newsman Walter Cronkite to be honored by NASA|work=University of Texas at Austin: Office of Public Affairs|publisher=Infinite Now|date=February 3, 2006|url=http://hypography.com/forums/science-news/5635-newsman-walter-cronkite-to-honored-nasa.html|access-date=July 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223641/http://hypography.com/forums/science-news/5635-newsman-walter-cronkite-to-honored-nasa.html|archive-date=July 25, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Memorial at Missouri Western State University ===\nOn November 4, 2013, [[Missouri Western State University]] in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], dedicated the Walter Cronkite Memorial.<ref>{{cite news |last=Weston |first=Alonzo |date=November 4, 2013 |title=Western dedicates Cronkite memorial |url=http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/article_52261b96-416b-5ee5-8aa6-4fbf54545e5e.html |newspaper=St. Joseph News-Press |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The nearly 6,000 square-foot memorial includes images, videos and memorabilia from Cronkite's life and the many events he covered as a journalist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waltercronkitememorial.org |title=Walter Cronkite Memorial |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> The memorial includes a replica of the newsroom from which Cronkite broadcast the news during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Waltz |first=Adam |date=November 9, 2015 |title=New piece of Cronkite display opens |url=http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/article_169adf76-1153-5e19-9d8e-df01cf4f2b46.html |newspaper=St. Joseph News-Press |access-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> In 2014, the Memorial received the Missouri Division of Tourism's Spotlight Award.<ref>{{cite news |title=Walter Cronkite Memorial receives state tourism award |url=http://www.stjoechannel.com/news/walter-cronkite-memorial-receives-state-tourism-award |newspaper=KQTV |location=St. Joseph, Missouri |date=October 10, 2014 |access-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420041645/http://www.stjoechannel.com/news/walter-cronkite-memorial-receives-state-tourism-award |archive-date=April 20, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== Books ==\n* ''The Challenges of Change'' (1971).
