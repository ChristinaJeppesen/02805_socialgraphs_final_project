At the time, Raza was a 15-year-old high school student from [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]], [[Quebec]], Canada. He had not intended for the video to become public, but its subsequent release led to ridicule, during which Raza chose to distance himself from the video.

The video was discovered by a schoolmate, whose friend created a computer file from the video tape. The video was distributed among the school's students.
