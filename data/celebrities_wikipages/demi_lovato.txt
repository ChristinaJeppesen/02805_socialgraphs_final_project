I'm even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?\"<ref name=\"popbuzz.com\" /> When Lovato confronted her management about these thoughts, the latter responded with, \"You're being very selfish, this would ruin things for not just you but for us as well.\" This made Lovato feel \"completely abandoned\" due to triggering her underlying abandonment issues with her birth father, and so she \"drank&nbsp;... that night\".<ref name=\"popbuzz.com\" />\n\n====Rape trauma====\nIn 2021, Lovato said she was raped at age 15 when she was an actor on the [[Disney Channel]], and that the rapist was a co-star whom she had to continue seeing thereafter. The incident contributed to her bulimia and self-harm. She told someone about the incident, but the assaulter \"never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in.\" Lovato stated she did not acknowledge the act as rape at the time, because sexual activity was not normalized to her and she was part of the Disney crowd who wore [[purity ring]]s and were waiting until marriage. However, she decided to share her experience because she believed that everyone should \"speak their voice if they can and feel comfortable doing so\". Lovato also stated she was raped during her 2018 drug overdose, realizing a month after the incident that she was not in a place to consent at that point.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maltceva|first=Margarita|date=March 17, 2021|title='I lost my virginity in a rape': Demi Lovato reveals she was raped as a teenager when she was acting on Disney Channel|work=National Post|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/i-lost-my-virginity-in-a-rape-demi-lovato-reveals-she-was-raped-as-a-teenager-when-she-was-acting-on-disney-channel|access-date=March 18, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Horton|first=Adrian|date=March 17, 2021|title=Demi Lovato says she was raped as a teenager by someone she knew|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/16/demi-lovato-rape-youtube-docuseries-dancing-with-the-devil|access-date=March 18, 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Other ventures==\n===Activism and philanthropy===\nLovato's work as an [[LGBT rights]] activist has been recognized by [[GLAAD]], which awarded her the Vanguard Award in 2016.<ref name=\"pinknews.co.uk\">{{Cite web|date=July 25, 2018|title=This is why Demi Lovato is an LGBT icon|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/07/25/demi-lovato-sexuality-addiction-mental-illness-lgbt-icon/|access-date=March 16, 2020|website=PinkNews|language=en-GB}}</ref> When the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] was appealed in June 2013, Lovato celebrated the occasion on social media.<ref name=\"LoveIsLove\">{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Emily|title=Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato Proclaim '#LoveIsLove' After Gay-Marriage Ruling|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1709619/supreme-court-gay-marriage-ruling-celebrity-reactions/|access-date=June 26, 2013|publisher=MTV}}</ref> Lovato has previously affirmed her support for the LGBT community: \"I believe in [[gay marriage]], I believe in equality.
