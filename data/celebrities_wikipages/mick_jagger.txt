[[Jagger\u2013Richards|His ongoing songwriting partnership]] with [[Keith Richards]] is one of the most successful in history. Jagger's career has spanned over six decades, and he has been widely described as one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of [[rock music]]. His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Richards' guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones' trademark throughout the band's career. Jagger gained press notoriety for his romantic involvements and illicit drug use, and was often portrayed as a [[counterculture|countercultural]] figure.\n\nJagger was born and grew up in [[Dartford]]. He studied at the [[London School of Economics]] before abandoning his studies to join the Rolling Stones. Jagger has written most of the Rolling Stones' songs together with Richards, and they continue to collaborate musically. In the late 1960s, Jagger starred in the films ''[[Performance (film)|Performance]]'' (1970) and ''[[Ned Kelly (1970 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (1970), to a mixed reception. Beginning in the 1980s, he has released a number of solo works, including four albums and the single \"[[Dancing in the Street#David Bowie and Mick Jagger version|Dancing in the Street]]\", a 1985 duet with [[David Bowie]] that reached No.&nbsp;1 in the UK and Australia and was a top-ten hit in numerous other countries.  In the 2000s, he co-founded a film production company, Jagged Films, and through them has produced feature films, beginning with the 2001 historical drama ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]''.  He began a solo recording career in 1985, releasing his first album, ''[[She's the Boss]]'', and joined the electric [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[SuperHeavy]] in 2009. Relationships with the Stones' members, particularly Richards, deteriorated during the 1980s, but Jagger has always found more success with the band than with his solo and side projects. He was married to [[Bianca Jagger|Bianca P\u00e9rez-Mora Macias]] from 1971 to 1978, and has had several other relationships, resulting in eight children with five women.\n\nIn 1989, Jagger was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], and into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] with the Rolling Stones in 2004. As a member of the Rolling Stones, and as a solo artist, he reached No.&nbsp;1 on the UK and US singles charts with 13 singles, the top 10 with 32 singles and the [[top 40]] with 70 singles. In 2003, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for his services to popular music. The genus [[Jaggermeryx|''Jaggermeryx naida'']] and the [[type species]] [[Aegrotocatellus|''Aegrotocatellus jaggeri'']] are named for him. Jagger is credited with bringing a style and sexiness to rock and roll and with being a trailblazer in pop music that subsequent generations of musicians have followed.\n\n==Early life==\nMichael Philip Jagger was born into a [[Social class in the United Kingdom|middle-class]] family in [[Dartford]], Kent, on 26&nbsp;July 1943.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/gallery/ |title=Baptism entry for Mick Jagger, rock musician, from the registers of Dartford St. Alban for 6&nbsp;October 1943. |last=Anon |work=[[Medway Council|Medway City Ark Document Gallery]] |access-date=17 September 2009 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805091229/http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/gallery/ |archive-date=5 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mick Jagger defies years as he hits pension age|date=25 July 2008|work=Reuters|access-date=16 July 2022|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jagger-idUSL599776420080725}}</ref> His father, Basil Fanshawe \"Joe\" Jagger, a former gymnast, was a physical education teacher who helped popularise basketball in Britain;<ref name=\"telegraph-3656537\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Norman|2012|p=959}}: \"Joe Jagger, that onetime wiry gymnast, was now a frail eighty-eight-year-old, lost without his partner of almost sixty years.\"</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Jagger's father dies |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/jaggers-father-dies-20061113-gdotb2.html |access-date=28 May 2021 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210528095332/https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/jaggers-father-dies-20061113-gdotb2.html |archive-date=28 May 2021 |quote=Basil \"Joe\" Jagger, a physical education teacher who helped popularise basketball in Britain, died at a hospital in Kingston, Surrey, about a week after he was injured during a fall at his home.}}</ref> his grandfather David Ernest Jagger was also a teacher.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite news |last1=Barratt |first1=Nick |title=Family detective: Mick Jagger |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435133/Family-detective-Mick-Jagger.html |access-date=28 May 2021 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609143320/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435133/Family-detective-Mick-Jagger.html |archive-date=9 June 2010 |quote=This suggested that some family upheaval had taken place, which was confirmed by an examination of David senior's life.
