He served as the 70th [[governor of Massachusetts]] from 2003 to 2007 and was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s nominee for [[president of the United States]] in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]], losing to [[Barack Obama]].\n\nRaised in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]], by [[George W. Romney|George]] and [[Lenore Romney]], he spent over two years in France as a [[Mormon missionary]]. He married [[Ann Romney|Ann Davies]] in 1969; they have five sons. Active in [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) throughout his adult life, Romney served as [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] of his [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] and later as a [[Stake (LDS Church)|stake president]] for an area covering Boston and many of its suburbs. By 1971, he had participated in the political campaigns of both his parents. In 1971 Romney graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[English studies|English]] from [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and in 1975 he received a [[JD\u2013MBA]] degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/successful-people-with-english-majors-2013-5 |first1=Vivian |last1=Giang |first2=Lynne |last2=Guey |first3=Max |last3=Nisen |date=May 16, 2013 |work=Business Insider |title=16 Wildly Successful People Who Majored In English|access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref> He became a management consultant and in 1977 joined [[Bain & Company]] in [[Boston]]. As Bain's [[chief executive officer]] (CEO), he helped lead the company out of a financial crisis<!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article -->. In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off company [[Bain Capital]], a [[private equity]] investment firm that became one of the [[List of private equity firms|largest of its kind]] in the nation.<!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article -->\n\nAfter stepping down from Bain Capital and his local leadership role in the LDS Church, Romney was the Republican nominee in the [[1994 United States Senate election in Massachusetts]]. After losing to five-term incumbent [[Ted Kennedy]], he resumed his position at Bain Capital. Years later, a successful stint as president and CEO of the then-struggling [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] led to a relaunch of his political career. Elected governor of Massachusetts in [[2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2002]], Romney helped develop and later signed a [[Massachusetts health care reform|health care reform]] law (commonly called \"Romneycare\") that provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and [[health insurance mandate|individual mandates to purchase insurance]]. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2\u20131.5 billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and closing corporate [[tax loopholes]]. He did not seek reelection in [[2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2006]], focusing instead on his campaign for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election]]. Though he won several [[United States presidential primary|primaries and caucuses]], Romney ultimately lost the nomination to Senator [[John McCain]]. Romney's considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190\u2013250 million, helped finance his political campaigns before 2012, when he again ran for and won the [[2012 Republican presidential nomination|Republican presidential nomination]], becoming the first [[Mormons|Mormon]] to be a [[major party]]'s nominee. He lost the election to President Obama, losing the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by a margin of 206\u2013332 and the popular vote by 47%\u201351%, almost five million votes.\n\nAfter reestablishing residency in Utah, Romney announced his campaign for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat held by the retiring [[Orrin Hatch]] in the [[2018 United States Senate election in Utah|2018 election]]; he defeated state representative [[Mike Kennedy (politician)|Mike Kennedy]] in the Republican primary and Democratic nominee [[Jenny Wilson (politician)|Jenny Wilson]] in the general election. In doing so, he became only the third person ever to be elected governor of one state and U.S. senator for another state (the others are [[Sam Houston]] and [[William Bibb]]). Romney is generally considered a [[Rockefeller Republican|moderate or centrist Republican]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-27 |title=Is Mitt Romney doing a good job in the Senate?
