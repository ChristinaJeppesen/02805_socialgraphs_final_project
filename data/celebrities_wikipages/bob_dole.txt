He was the [[Republican Leader of the Senate]] during the final 11 years of his tenure, including three non-consecutive years as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. Prior to his 27 years in the Senate, he served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1961 to 1969. Dole was also the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nominee in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]] and the vice presidential nominee in the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 election]].\n\nDole was born and raised in [[Russell, Kansas]], where he established a legal career after serving with distinction in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. Following a period as [[Russell County, Kansas|Russell County]] Attorney, he won election to the House of Representatives in 1960. In 1968, Dole was elected to the Senate, where he served as chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]] from 1971 to 1973 and chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] from 1981 to 1985. He led the Senate Republicans from 1985 to his resignation in 1996, and served as Senate Majority Leader from 1985 to 1987 and from 1995 to 1996. In his role as Republican leader, he helped defeat Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]].\n\nPresident [[Gerald Ford]] chose Dole as his running mate in the 1976 election after Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]] withdrew from seeking a full term. Ford was defeated by Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] in the general election. Dole sought the Republican presidential nomination in [[1980 Republican Party presidential primaries|1980]], but quickly dropped out of the race. He experienced more success in the [[1988 Republican Party presidential primaries|1988 Republican primaries]] but was defeated by Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Dole won the Republican presidential nomination in [[1996 Republican Party presidential primaries|1996]] and selected [[Jack Kemp]] as his running mate. The Republican ticket lost in the general election to Clinton, making Dole the first unsuccessful major party nominee for both president and vice president. He resigned from the Senate during the 1996 campaign and did not seek public office again after the election.\n\nDole remained active after retiring from public office. He appeared in numerous commercials and television programs and served on various councils. In 2012, Dole unsuccessfully advocated Senate ratification of the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. He initially supported [[Jeb Bush 2016 presidential campaign|Jeb Bush]] in the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 Republican primaries]], but later became the only former Republican presidential nominee to endorse [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|Donald Trump]] in the general election. Dole was a member of the advisory council of the [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]] and special counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of [[law firm]] [[Alston & Bird]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/about/nationaladvisors.php|title=National Advisory Council|publisher=[[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610171740/http://www.victimsofcommunism.org/about/nationaladvisors.php|archive-date=June 10, 2011|access-date=May 20, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Dole was awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]] on January 17, 2018.

I thought they were missing.\"\nAs Lee Sandlin describes, when fellow soldiers saw the extent of his injuries, they believed all they could do was \"give him the largest dose of [[morphine]] they dared and write an 'M' for 'morphine' on his forehead in his own blood, so that nobody else who found him would give him a second, fatal dose.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leesandlin.com/articles/LosingTheWar.htm|title=\"Losing the War\" by Lee Sandlin |publisher=Leesandlin.com|access-date=June 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDole was paralyzed from the neck down and transported to a military hospital near Kansas.

''One Soldier's Story'', pp. 202\u201304.</ref> He remained despondent, \"not ready to accept the fact that my life would be changed forever\". He was encouraged to see [[Hampar Kelikian]], an [[orthopedist]] in Chicago who had been working with veterans returning from war. Although during their first meeting Kelikian told Dole that he would never be able to recover fully, the encounter changed Dole's outlook on life, who years later wrote of Kelikian, a survivor of the [[Armenian genocide]], \"Kelikian inspired me to focus on what I had left and what I could do with it, rather than complaining what had been lost.\" Dr. K, as Dole later came to affectionately call him, operated on him seven times, free of charge, and had, in Dole's words, \"an impact on my life second only to my family\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bobelian|first=Michael|title=Children of Armenia: A Forgotten Genocide and the Century-long Struggle for Justice|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=2009|pages=164\u201365|isbn=978-1-4165-5725-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Dole and Daniel Inouye at Percy Jones Army Hospital.jpg|thumb|left|Friend and future senator [[Daniel Inouye]] (''left'') with Dole (''next to Inouye'') playing cards while recovering at [[Percy Jones Army Hospital]] in the mid-1940s.]]\nDole recovered from his wounds at the Percy Jones Army Hospital in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]].

If elected, he would have become the oldest president to take office and the first Kansas native to become president (as [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was born in Texas). Dole found the initial draft of the nomination acceptance speech written by [[Mark Helprin]] too hardline, so Kerry Tymchuk, who was part of the \"'Let Dole be Dole' crowd\", revised the speech to cover the themes of honor, decency, and straight talk. It included the following line, a gibe at the all-or-nothing rookie Republicans who had ridden the 1994 midterm GOP wave into Congress: \"In politics honorable compromise is no sin. It is what protects us from absolutism and intolerance\"'.<ref name=\"oregonlive.com\"/>\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Dole stated, \"Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth.
