After rising to fame as [[Fonzie|Arthur \"Fonzie\" Fonzarelli]] on the American television series ''[[Happy Days]]'', Winkler has distinguished himself as a [[character actor]] for roles such as Arthur Himbry in ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]],'' Coach Klein in ''[[The Waterboy]],'' [[Barry Zuckerkorn]] in ''[[Arrested Development]],'' Eddie R.

Winkler's [[List of awards and nominations received by Henry Winkler|accolades]] include a [[Primetime Emmy Awards|Primetime Emmy]], two [[Daytime Emmy Awards|Daytime Emmys]], two [[Golden Globe Awards]], and a [[Critics' Choice Television Award|Critics Choice Award]].\n\nAs a child, Winkler struggled at [[List of public elementary schools in New York City#Region 10: Manhattan, the Bronx|P.S. 87 on West 78th Street, Manhattan]] and the [[McBurney School]], where he was berated for his poor academic performance. He then studied theater at both [[Emerson College]] and the [[Yale School of Drama]], spent a year and half with the [[Yale Repertory Theater]], did regional theater and commercial work, and appeared in two independent films. After saving up money, he traveled to California in September 1973, and was cast in a small role for ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]].'' He also auditioned for ''Happy Days'' and won the part of Arthur \"Fonzie\" Fonzarelli, a role he played for the next ten years. During his time on ''Happy Days'', Winkler was diagnosed as [[dyslexia|dyslexic]].\n\nAfter the end of ''Happy Days'', Winkler found himself [[Typecasting|typecast]] and moved into producing and directing. He helped develop the original ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'' television series and worked on programs such as ''[[Sightings (TV series)|Sightings]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]''. He also directed the theatrical releases ''[[Memories of Me]]'' with [[Billy Crystal]] and ''[[Cop and a Half]]'' with [[Burt Reynolds]]. In 2003, he drew upon his childhood struggles with dyslexia to co-write the ''[[Hank Zipzer]]'' series of children's books with [[children's literature]] author [[Lin Oliver]]. He and Oliver also created the BBC adaptation (in which Winkler appears as Mr. Rock) ''[[Hank Zipzer (TV series)|Hank Zipzer]]'' and the 2016 Christmas special, ''[[Hank Zipzer's Christmas Catastrophe]].'' They next released the prequel book series ''Here's Hank'', as well as two additional book series: the ''Ghost Buddy'' books, and the ''Alien Superstar'' books. \n\nWinkler has [[List of awards and nominations received by Henry Winkler#Honorary|been honored]] for his role as \"The Fonz\", and for his work with dyslexia through the ''Hank Zipzer'' series. In 1980, he donated one of Fonzie's leather jackets to the [[National Museum of American History]]. In 1981, he received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and in 2008, The ''[[Bronze Fonz]]'' statue was unveiled along the [[Milwaukee Riverwalk]]. In 2011, he was appointed an [[Honorary Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[Elizabeth II]], and was named one of the ''United Kingdom's Top 10 Literacy Heroes'' in 2013.\n\n==Family history (1939\u20131945)==\n{{quote box|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"[By 1939], my father knew that it was time.

Winkler added his own interpretation of the character during the first episode, based on \"a deal\" he had made with himself that he would never comb his hair, chew gum, or keep a box of cigarettes rolled in his sleeve (as this is what actors typically did with this type of character).<ref name=\"comm_02\" /> Although he tried to explain this philosophy to the producers, he was told he had to follow the script and comb his hair. He thus stood at the mirror, motioned in a way that suggested \"Hey I don't have to because it's perfect,\" and in doing so, created the seminal moment which defined the character.<ref name=\"comm_02\" /> In addition, ABC executives did not want to see Fonzie wearing leather, thinking it would imply that the character was a criminal. Thus, during the first season, Winkler wore two different [[windbreaker]] jackets, one of which was green.<ref name=\"nevernpr\" /> Marshall argued with the executives about the jacket, and eventually they made a compromise: Fonzie could wear the leather jacket, but only in scenes with his motorcycle. Marshall thus made certain that his motorcycle was written into every scene.<ref name=\"surrogatedad\" /> In reality, Winkler did not know how to ride a motorcycle. As he almost crashed it the first time he tried, he subsequently never rode the motorcycle during the series.<ref name=\"comm_02\" />\n\nBy the middle of the second season in December 1974, \"The Fonz\" began his transition as a [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]] when he was featured as the central protagonist in the episode, [[Happy Days (season 2)#Episodes|\"Guess Who's Coming to Christmas.\"]]<ref name=\"sagfund\" /> By the third season, he became the lead of the series, as the storylines shifted away from the original protagonist, Richie Cunningham, to \"The Fonz.\" Winkler recalled in a 2018 interview that he directly addressed the issue with Ron Howard who portrayed Richie, asking him \"how has what's happened affected you? You are the star of the show, and the Fonz has taken off.\"<ref name=\"sagfund\" /> According to Winkler, Howard told him that although he \"was signed on as the star, you did nothing except be as good as you could be. It's good for the show, we're friends.\"<ref name=\"sagfund\" /> In 2021, Howard reiterated these points by stating that Winkler had been \"sort of a big brother\" to him, and was \"very supportive of the idea of me being a filmmaker.\"<ref name=\"rh21\">{{cite web|date=October 12, 2021|title=Ron Howard and Clint Howard Talk Brotherhood and Growing Up in Hollywood in Memoir|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1-dFh3-QA|access-date=October 12, 2021|publisher=[[The View (talk show)|The View]]|archive-date=October 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211013015919/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1-dFh3-QA|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2018 interview with Winkler, journalist Michael Schneider suggests that it was at this point that \"the Fonz, became the biggest icon on television\" at that time.<ref name=\"sagfund\" /> Winkler responded by stating that he \"went from somebody who had no sense of self\" to a situation that was \"scary. People wanted, you know, parts of my clothing, it was overwhelming.\"<ref name=\"sagfund\" /> He has also admitted that while he shares some characteristics with \"The Fonz\" such as loyalty to friends and an undercurrent of anger that he drew from his struggles with school as a child,<ref name=\"comm_02\" /> they were fundamentally different from one another. According to Winkler, \"The Fonz\" was \"my alter ego. He was everybody I wasn't...He was in charge. He was confident. He was everybody that I ever wanted to have some part of in my body.\"<ref name=\"nevernpr\" /><ref name=\"Guardian-2011\">{{cite news|last1=Puckrik|first1=Katie|date=September 27, 2011|title=Henry Winkler: 'The Fonz was everything I wanted to be'|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/sep/27/henry-winkler-the-fonz|url-status=live|access-date=September 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112022340/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/sep/27/henry-winkler-the-fonz|archive-date=November 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Dyslexia ===\n{{further|Dyslexia}}\n\nDuring his time on ''Happy Days,'' Winkler realized that he was [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]], after his stepson Jed was diagnosed with this [[learning disability]].<ref name=\"nevernpr\" /><ref name=\"ycc\" /><ref name=npratc19/> Previously, Winkler only knew that aspects of reading and memorizing were difficult, but did not understand why. He thus developed coping mechanisms that allowed him to mask the difficulties he had with cold-reading scripts. If he was allowed to see the script prior to the reading, he would memorize it \"as quickly as I could because I couldn't read the page and act at the same time to make an impression on the casting person or on the director and the producers...and I improvised the rest. And when they said, 'Well you're not doing what's written on the page,' I said, 'I'm giving you the essence of the character.'\"<ref name=npratc19>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/01/27/689070922/dyslexia-made-henry-winkler-feel-stupid-for-years-now-he-s-a-best-selling-author\n|title=Dyslexia Made Henry Winkler Feel 'Stupid' For Years.

He later recalled that prior to learning about dyslexia, he frequently embarrassed himself in front of his fellow cast members as he would \"stumble at least once or twice a paragraph. And then I was diagnosed, and I made fun of it\u2014I covered it in humor. But I was humiliated...[as] when I didn't know what was going on for the first year or two, they laughed. I'm sure it was frustrating because I kept breaking up the rhythm of the joke or the scene.
