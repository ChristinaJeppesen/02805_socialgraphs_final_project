His name and image are still symbols of the company.\n\nSanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as [[Stoker (occupation)|steam engine stoker]], [[insurance]] salesman, and [[filling station]] operator. He began selling [[fried chicken]] from [[Harland Sanders Caf\u00e9 and Museum|his roadside restaurant]] in [[North Corbin, Kentucky]], during the [[Great Depression]]. During that time, Sanders developed his \"secret recipe\" and his patented method of cooking chicken in a [[pressure fryer]]. Sanders recognized the potential of the restaurant [[restaurant franchise|franchising]] concept, and the first KFC franchise opened in [[South Salt Lake, Utah]], in 1952. When his original restaurant closed, he devoted himself full-time to franchising his fried chicken throughout the country.\n\nThe company's rapid expansion across the United States and overseas became overwhelming for Sanders. In 1964, then 73 years old, he sold the company to a group of investors led by [[John Y. Brown Jr.]] and [[Jack C. Massey]] for $2 million. However, he retained control of operations in Canada, and he became a salaried brand ambassador for Kentucky Fried Chicken. In his later years, he became highly critical of the food served by KFC restaurants, as he believed they had cut costs and allowed quality to deteriorate.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1890\u20131906: Early life===\n[[File:Sanders mother.png|thumb|left|Sanders at the age of seven with his mother in 1897]]\nHarland David Sanders was born on September 9, 1890, in a four-room house located {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} east of [[Henryville, Indiana]].<ref name=\"Klotter2005p130\">Klotter, ''The Human Tradition in the New South'', p. 130.</ref> He was the oldest of three children born to Wilbur David and Margaret Ann ([[Name at birth|n\u00e9e]] Dunlevy) Sanders.<ref name=\"Klotter2005p130\" /> His mother was of Irish and Dutch descent.<ref name=\"pearce3\">{{cite book |last1=Pearce |first1=John Ed |title=The Colonel |date=1982 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/colonelcaptiva00pear/page/3 3] |isbn=9780385181228 |edition=1st |url=https://archive.org/details/colonelcaptiva00pear |url-access=registration |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref> The family attended the [[Advent Christian Church]].<ref name=advent>{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Harland|title=The Incredible Colonel|year=1974|publisher=Creation House|location=Illinois|page=13|isbn=978-0-88419-053-0}}</ref> His father was a mild and affectionate man who worked his 80-acre farm, until he broke his leg in a fall.

They did make it in [[2003 Japan Series|2003]], [[2005 Japan Series|2005]], and [[2014 Japan Series|2014]] however. They lost in all three appearances, including a four-game sweep by the [[Chiba Lotte Marines]] in 2005, who hit 10 home runs in the first three games.\n\nCharacters based on Colonel Sanders have appeared in popular fiction. The Colonel appears as a character within the [[DC Multiverse|DC Comics multiverse]] in three promotional issues, with titles parodying other [[DC Comics]] titles - ''The Colonel of Two Worlds'' (a parody of ''[[Flash of Two Worlds]]''), ''The Colonel Corps: The Crisis of Infinite Colonels'' (a parody of ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''<u>),</u> and ''Across The Universe'', teaming up with characters such as [[Green Lantern]] and [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and alternate versions of himself (such as a female version, a ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' version, and a [[chicken]] version) to battle villains such as the \"Anti-Colonel\" of Earth-3, \"Colonel Grodd\" (a Colonel version of [[Gorilla Grodd]]) and [[Larfleeze]]. The writer of the comics, [[Tony Bedard]], said \"It's been an honor, a privilege, and just plain fun working on the last two KFC comics. I'm super-excited the story is a trilogy now, with the Colonel planet-hopping across the DC Universe. As a former [[Green Lantern (comic book)|''Green Lantern'']] writer, it's great to revisit [[Hal Jordan]] and the [[Green Lantern Corps]].\"<ref>{{cite news | last=Diaz | first=Eric | date=July 8, 2016 | title=KFC'S Col.
