After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 murders committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total is unknown and likely significantly higher.{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=43}}\n\nBundy was regarded as charismatic and handsome, and exploited this to win the trust of both his victims and society as a whole. He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before [[bludgeoning]] them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and [[necrophilia|performing sexual acts with the corpses]] until [[corpse decomposition|decomposition]] and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. He [[decapitation|decapitated]] at least twelve victims and kept their severed heads as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\n\nIn 1975, Bundy was arrested and jailed in [[Utah]] for aggravated kidnapping and attempted [[assault|criminal assault]]. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. Facing murder charges in [[Colorado]], Bundy engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in [[Florida]], including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three [[Capital punishment in Florida|death sentences]] in two trials. Bundy was executed at [[Florida State Prison]] in [[Raiford, Florida|Raiford]] on January 24, 1989.\n\nBiographer [[Ann Rule]] described him as \"a sadistic [[sociopath]] who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death and even after.\"{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xiv}} Bundy once described himself as \"the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet,\"{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=263}}<ref name=\"Hare1999\" /> a statement with which attorney [[Polly Nelson]], a member of his last defense team, agreed. \"Ted,\" she wrote, \"was the very definition of heartless evil.\"{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=319}}\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Early life ==\n=== Childhood ===\nTed Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (1924\u20132012, known by her middle name) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers<ref>[http://www.lundvt.org/ Lund Family Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307150638/https://lundvt.org/ |date=March 7, 2017 }}, retrieved September 30, 2015.\n</ref> in [[Burlington, Vermont]].

Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Bundy eventually discovered the truth, although his recollections of the circumstances varied; he told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a \"bastard,\"{{sfn|Kendall|1981|pp=40\u201341}} but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and [[Hugh Aynesworth]] that he had found the certificate himself.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=62}} Biographer and [[true crime]] writer [[Ann Rule]], who knew Bundy personally, wrote that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=16\u201317}} Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nBundy occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior at an early age. Louise's younger sister Julia recalled awakening from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the kitchen, and three-year-old Ted standing by the bed, smiling.{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=505}} Bundy's childhood neighbor Sandi Holt described him as a bully, saying, \"He liked to terrify people... He liked to be in charge. He liked to inflict pain and suffering and fear.\"<ref>{{cite web|first=Jill|last=Sederstrom|url=https://www.oxygen.com/martinis-murder/what-was-ted-bundys-childhood-like|title=What Was Ted Bundy's Childhood Like?|website=[[Oxygen.com]]|date=August 11, 2019|accessdate=August 9, 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=17\u201318}} and told Rule that he \"identified with,\" \"respected,\" and \"clung to\" his grandfather.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=9}} In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel was a tyrannical bully who beat his wife and dog, exhibited bigotry (including religious intolerance, racism, and xenophobia), and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. In one instance, Samuel threw Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=330}} He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences,{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} and at least once flew into a violent rage when the question of Bundy's paternity was raised.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=330}} Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent [[electroconvulsive therapy]] for [[depression (mood)|depression]]{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=501\u2013508}} These descriptions of Bundy's grandparents have been questioned in more recent investigations. Some locals remembered Samuel Cowell as a \"fine man\", if a bit eccentric. A cousin of Bundy claimed that the negative characterizations of Samuel Cowell likely arose to explain why his grandson became a serial killer. In addition, Louise's sister Audrey stated that their mother couldn't leave her home because she suffered a stroke due to being overweight and was not mentally ill.{{sfn|Barth|2020|p=296\u2013299}}\n\n[[File:Ted Bundy HS Yearbook.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|Bundy as a senior in high school, 1965]]\nIn 1950, Louise changed her surname from Cowell to Nelson{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=8}} and, at the urging of multiple family members, left Philadelphia with Ted to live with cousins Alan and Jane Scott in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=155}} In 1951 she met Johnny Culpepper Bundy (1921\u20132007), a hospital cook, at an adult singles night at Tacoma's First Methodist Church.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=57}} They married later that year and Johnny formally adopted Ted.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=57}} Johnny and Louise conceived four children together, and though Johnny tried to include his adopted son in camping trips and other family activities, Ted remained distant from him.<ref>\"40 Disturbing Ted Bundy Facts That Will Make Your Skin Crawl\".

To Michaud and Aynesworth, he described roaming his neighborhood, picking through trash barrels in search of pictures of naked women {{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=22}} and to Polly Nelson he said that he perused detective magazines, crime novels, and true crime documentaries for stories that involved [[sexual violence]], particularly when the stories were illustrated with pictures of dead or maimed women.{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=277\u2013278}} In a letter to Rule, however, he asserted that he \"never, ever read fact-detective magazines, and shuddered at the thought that anyone would.\"{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=612}} He told Michaud that he would consume large quantities of alcohol and \"canvass the community\" late at night in search of undraped windows where he could observe women undressing, or \"whatever [else] could be seen.\"{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nAccounts of Bundy's social life also varied. He told Michaud and Aynesworth that he \"chose to be alone\" as an adolescent because he was unable to understand interpersonal relationships.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=64}} He claimed that he had no natural sense of how to develop friendships. \"I didn't know what made people want to be friends,\" Bundy said. \"I didn't know what underlay social interactions.\"{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=66}} Classmates from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] however, told Rule that Bundy was \"well known and well liked\" there, \"a medium-sized fish in a large pond.\"{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=13}}\n\nBundy's only significant athletic avocation was downhill skiing, which he pursued enthusiastically with stolen equipment and [[forgery|forged]] lift tickets.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=62}} During high school, he was arrested at least twice on suspicion of [[burglary]] and [[motor vehicle theft]].

Psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis]] would later pinpoint this crisis as \"probably the pivotal time in his development\".{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=279}} Devastated by the breakup, Bundy traveled to [[Colorado]] and then farther east, visiting relatives in [[Arkansas]] and Philadelphia and enrolling for one semester at [[Temple University]].{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=19}} It was also at this time in early 1969, Rule believed, that Bundy visited the office of birth records in Burlington and confirmed his true parentage.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=53}}\n\nBundy was back in Washington by the fall of 1969, when he met Elizabeth Kloepfer (identified in Bundy literature as Meg Anders, Beth Archer, or Liz Kendall), a single mother from [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], [[Utah]], who worked as a secretary at the UW School of Medicine.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=74}} Their stormy relationship would continue well past his initial incarceration in Utah in 1976.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Storey |first1=Kate |title=Elizabeth Kendall Dated Ted Bundy As He Murdered Dozens.

He became an honor student and was well regarded by his professors.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=18\u201320}} In 1971, he took a job at [[Seattle]]'s Suicide Hotline Crisis Center. There, he met and worked alongside Ann Rule, a former Seattle police officer and aspiring crime writer who would later write one of the definitive Bundy biographies, ''[[The Stranger Beside Me]]''.

Davis thought well of Bundy and described him as \"smart, aggressive&nbsp;... and a believer in the system.\"{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=46}} In early 1973, despite mediocre [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]] scores, Bundy was accepted into the law schools of UPS and the [[S.J.

She marveled at his transformation into a serious and dedicated professional who was seemingly on the cusp of a significant legal and political career. Bundy continued to date Kloepfer as well; neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973, he [[Matriculation|matriculated]] at [[Seattle University School of Law|UPS Law School]],{{sfn|Rule|2009|pp=45\u201346}} and continued courting Edwards, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage, and at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fianc\u00e9e.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=51}}\n\nIn January 1974, Bundy abruptly broke off all contact with Edwards; her phone calls and letters went unreturned.  When she finally reached him by phone a month later, she demanded to know why he had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation.  In a flat, calm voice, he replied, \"Diane, I have no idea what you mean,\" and hung up. She never heard from him again.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=52}} Bundy later explained, \"I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her\";{{sfn|Foreman|1992|p=16}} but Edwards concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance, as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=52}}\n\nBy then, Bundy had begun skipping classes at law school. By April he had stopped attending entirely,{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=44\u201347}} as young women began to disappear in the [[Pacific Northwest]].{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=81\u201384}} There is no consensus as to when or where Bundy began killing women.

He described three additional previously unknown victims in Washington and two in Oregon whom he declined to identify (if indeed he ever knew their identities).{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=337}} He said he left a fifth corpse\u2014Manson's\u2014on Taylor Mountain,{{sfn|Rule|2000|p=516}} but incinerated her head in Kloepfer's fireplace.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=395}} \"He described the Issaquah crime scene [where the bones of Ott, Naslund, and Hawkins were found], and it was almost like he was just there\", Keppel said. \"Like he was seeing everything.

He explained that when he was in Utah he could bring his victims back to his apartment, \"where he could reenact scenarios depicted on the covers of detective magazines.\"<ref name=\"timeline\"/> A new ulterior strategy quickly became apparent: he withheld many details, hoping to [[parlay (gambling)|parlay]] the incomplete information into yet another stay of execution. \"There are other buried remains in Colorado\", he admitted, but refused to elaborate.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7600\u201305}} The new strategy\u2014immediately dubbed \"Ted's bones-for-time scheme\"\u2014served only to deepen the resolve of authorities to see Bundy executed on schedule, and yielded little new detailed information.{{sfn|Von Drehle|1995|pp=352\u2013358}} In cases where he did give details, nothing was found.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=363}} Colorado detective Matt Lindvall interpreted this as a conflict between his desire to postpone his execution by divulging information and his need to remain in \"total possession\u2014the only person who knew his victims' true resting places.\"{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7550\u201358}}\n\nWhen it became clear that no further stays would be forthcoming from the courts, Bundy supporters began lobbying for the only remaining option, [[clemency|executive clemency]].

She moved back to Washington with her daughter and refused to accept his phone call on the morning of his execution. \"She was hurt by his relationship with Diana [Weiner],\" Nelson wrote, \"and devastated by his sudden wholesale confessions in his last days.\"{{sfn|Nelson|1994|pp=271, 303}}\n\nHagmaier was present during Bundy's final interviews with investigators.

He would employ various ruses designed to lure his victim to the vicinity of his vehicle where he had pre-positioned a weapon, usually a crowbar. In many cases he wore a plaster cast on one leg or a sling on one arm, and sometimes hobbled on crutches, then requested assistance in carrying something to his vehicle. Bundy was regarded as handsome and charismatic, traits he exploited to win the confidence of his victims and the people around him in his daily life.{{sfn|Keppel|2005|pp=3\u20136}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=12}}<ref name=\"Time25crimes\" /> \"Ted lured females\", Michaud wrote, \"the way a lifeless silk flower can dupe a honey bee.\"{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=14}} In situations where his looks and charm were not useful, he invoked authority by identifying himself as a police officer or firefighter. Once Bundy had them near or inside his vehicle, he would overpower and bludgeon them, and then restrain them with handcuffs. He would then transport them to a pre-selected secondary site, often a considerable distance away, and strangle them by garrote during the act of rape.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>{{sfn|Geberth|2015|p=991}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=12\u201313}} In the case of his Utah victims, the secondary site would be his apartment building.<ref name=\"timeline\"/> Toward the end of his spree, in Florida, perhaps under the stress of being a fugitive, he regressed to indiscriminate attacks on sleeping victims.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nAt secondary sites Bundy would remove and later burn the victim's clothing,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=196}} or in at least one case (Cunningham's) deposit them in a [[Goodwill Industries]] collection bin.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7481}} He explained that the clothing removal was ritualistic, but also a practical matter, as it minimized the chance of leaving trace evidence at the crime scene that could implicate him.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|p=196}} (A manufacturing error in fibers from his own clothing, ironically, provided a crucial incriminating link to the Leach killing.){{sfn|Rule|2009|p=279}} He often revisited his secondary crime scenes to engage in acts of necrophilia,{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=334}} and to groom or dress up the cadavers.{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7583\u201391, 7655}} Some victims were found wearing articles of clothing they had never worn, or nail polish that family members had never seen.<ref name=\"Mystique\" /> Bundy took Polaroid photos of many of his victims. \"When you work hard to do something right,\" he told Hagmaier, \"you don't want to forget it.\"{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|pp=334\u2013335}} Consumption of large quantities of alcohol was an \"essential component\", he told both Keppel and Michaud; he needed to be \"extremely drunk\" while on the prowl{{sfn|Keppel|2005|p=379}}{{sfn|Keppel|2010|loc=Kindle location 7046}} in order to \"significantly diminish\" his inhibitions and to \"sedate\" the \"dominant personality\" that he feared might prevent his inner \"entity\" from acting on his impulses.{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1989|pp=76\u201377}}\n\nAll of Bundy's known victims were white females, most of middle-class backgrounds.

Rule speculated that Bundy's animosity toward his first girlfriend triggered his protracted rampage and caused him to target victims who resembled her.{{sfn|Rule|2000|pp=431\u2013432}} Bundy dismissed this hypothesis: \"[T]hey ... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive\", he told Aynesworth. \"Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar ...

Many had corresponded with him, \"each believing that she was his only one\".

[[Dorothy Otnow Lewis]], a professor of psychiatry at the [[New York University School of Medicine]] and an authority on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of [[bipolar disorder]],{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=152}} but later changed her impression more than once.{{sfn|Rule|2009|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Michaud|Aynesworth|1999|p=331}} She also suggested the possibility of a [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy \"seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person&nbsp;... [she] suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger.\"{{sfn|Nelson|1994|p=154}} Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: \"He said, 'He became weird on me.'
