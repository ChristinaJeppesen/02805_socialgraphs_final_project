Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege, and the fighting was limited to small-scale raids and skirmishes. The narrow Boston Neck, which at that time was only about a hundred feet wide, impeded Washington's ability to invade Boston, and a long stalemate ensued. A young officer, [[Rufus Putnam]], came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood that could be erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness. Putnam supervised this effort, which successfully installed both the fortifications and dozens of cannon on Dorchester Heights that [[Henry Knox]] had laboriously brought through the snow from Fort Ticonderoga. The astonished British awoke the next morning to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them. General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his army could have done in six months. The British Army attempted a cannon barrage for two hours, but their shot could not reach the colonists' cannons at such a height. The British gave up, boarded their ships and sailed away.

Boston's harbor activity was significantly curtailed by the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] (adopted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]) and the [[War of 1812]]. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim. Manufacturing became an important component of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Old State House and State Street, Boston 1801.jpg|thumb|State Street, 1801]]\nDuring this period, Boston flourished culturally, as well, admired for its [[Classic book|rarefied literary life]] and generous [[the arts|artistic patronage]],<ref name=\"BosLitHist\">{{Cite web |date=July 30, 2012 |title=Home page |url=http://www.bostonliteraryhistory.com |access-date=May 22, 2012 |website=Forgotten Chapters of Boston's Literary History |publisher=The Trustees of Boston College |format=Exhibition at Boston Public Library and Massachusetts Historical Society |archive-date=February 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225045450/http://www.bostonliteraryhistory.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"BosLitHistMap\">{{Cite web |date=July 30, 2012 |title=An Interactive Map of Literary Boston: 1794\u20131862 |url=http://bostonliteraryhistory.com/sites/default/files/bostonliteraryhistorymap.pdf |access-date=May 22, 2012 |website=Forgotten Chapters of Boston's Literary History |publisher=The Trustees of Boston College |format=Exhibition |archive-date=May 16, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516025723/http://bostonliteraryhistory.com/sites/default/files/bostonliteraryhistorymap.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> with members of old Boston families\u2014eventually dubbed ''[[Boston Brahmin]]s''\u2014coming to be regarded as the nation's social and cultural elites.{{sfn|Kennedy|1994|p=44}} They are often associated with the [[American upper class]], [[Harvard University]];<ref>{{cite book |title=Visions of Belonging: New England Art and the Making of American Identity |first=Julia |last=B.
