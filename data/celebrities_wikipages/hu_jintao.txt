(PRC) from 2003 to 2013, and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)|chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) from 2004 to 2012. He was a member of the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP Politburo Standing Committee]], China's ''de facto'' top decision-making body, from 1992 to 2012. Hu was the [[paramount leader]] of China from 2002 to 2012.{{efn|\"[[Paramount leader]]\" is not a formal title; it is a reference occasionally used by media outlets and scholars to refer to the foremost political leader in China at a given time. There is no consensus on when Hu became the paramount leader or when his term ended. Hu became CCP general secretary, the top leader of the Chinese Communist Party in 2002, held the \"trio\" of top offices in the party, state and military\u2014general secretary, president and CMC chairman\u2014by 2004 and relinquished all three positions by 2013 to his successor.}}\n\nHu rose to power through the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), notably as [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary|Party Committee secretary]] for [[Guizhou]] province and the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], where his harsh repression of dissent gained him attention from the highest levels.<ref name=\"Ewing, 2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Ewing |first1=Richard Daniel |title=Hu Jintao: The Making of a Chinese General Secretary |journal=The China Quarterly |date=20 March 2003 |volume=173 |pages=17\u201334 |doi=10.1017/S0009443903000032 |s2cid=154666535 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/china-quarterly/article/abs/hu-jintao-the-making-of-a-chinese-general-secretary/17B33032553080A8B52A50A9CA9995A8}}</ref> He moved up to first secretary of the [[Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP Central Secretariat]] and [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] under CCP general secretary [[Jiang Zemin]]. Hu was the first [[Leader of the Chinese Communist Party|leader of the Communist Party]] from a generation younger than those who participated in the civil war and the founding of the republic. Influential sponsors from the older generation promoted his rapid rise, including [[Song Ping]], [[Hu Yaobang]], [[Deng Xiaoping]], and Jiang Zemin.<ref name=\"Ewing, 2003\"/>\n\nDuring his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with his colleague [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]], Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a [[Great power|major world power]]. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]], which aimed to build a \"[[Harmonious Socialist Society]]\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict. Under his leadership, the authorities also cracked down on social disturbances, ethnic minority protests, and dissident figures, which also led to many controversial events such as the [[2008 Tibetan unrest|unrest in Tibet]] and the passing of the [[Anti-Secession Law]]. In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"[[China's peaceful rise|China's peaceful development]]\", pursuing [[Soft power of China|soft power]] in international relations and a corporate approach to diplomacy. Throughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.\n\nHu possessed a modest and reserved leadership style. His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Elegant|first=Simon|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1668457,00.html|title=In China, Hu is the Man to See|magazine=Time|date=4 October 2007|access-date=13 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619115625/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1668457,00.html|archive-date=19 June 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye.

In 1980, [[Deng Xiaoping]] implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, [[Song Ping]], the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission.<ref>Nathan & Gilley, p. 40</ref> Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\nIn 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the [[All-China Youth Federation]].<ref name=\"PeoplesDailyBio\">{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/people/hujintao.shtml|title=Hu Jintao|work=[[People's Daily]]|access-date=16 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619113445/http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/data/people/hujintao.shtml|archive-date=19 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Ewing, 2003\" /> His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of [[Hu Yaobang]] (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping's suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the [[Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Party School]].<ref>Nathan & Gilley, p. 42</ref> Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the [[Communist Youth League of China|Communist Youth League]] Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader.

Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-[[Han Chinese|Han]] sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 [[People's Armed Police]] into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance.<ref name=\"jt\">{{cite web|last=Tkacik|first=John|title=Who's Hu?

Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense. In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control.

Whether Hu provided \"inspiration\" for the PLA on 4 June is a matter of debate, but it was clear that Hu's actions in Lhasa earned him unprecedented attention in the upper echelons of party power, including by \"paramount leader\" Deng Xiaoping. When tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, Hu was one of the first regional leaders to publicly declare his support for the central authorities.<ref name=jt/>\n\nHu experienced high-altitude sickness in June 1990, and returned to Beijing, but remained in his position for another two years, during which he achieved little.

Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.<ref>Nathan & Gilley, pp.42-43</ref> Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\nIn 1992, Hu took charge of the [[Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party]], which oversaw day-to-day operations of the [[Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|CCP Central Committee]], and the Central Party School, which was convenient for him to bring up his own supporters among senior CCP cadres. Hu was also put in charge of the ideological work of the CCP. Although Hu was considered heir apparent to Jiang, he always took great care to ensure that Jiang be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu promoted Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"[[Three Stresses]]\"{{spaced ndash}} \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\"{{spaced ndash}} giving speeches to promote it. In 2001, he publicized Jiang's [[Three Represents]] theory, which Jiang hoped to place himself on the same level as other [[Marxist]] theoreticians.<ref>Nathan & Gilley, p. 84</ref> In 1998, Hu became vice president, and Jiang wanted Hu to play a more active role in foreign affairs.

Hu's political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans&nbsp;\u2014 a \"[[Harmonious Socialist Society]]\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the [[Scientific Development Concept]], which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms.<ref name=Kuhn/> The Scientific Development doctrine was written into the Communist Party and State Constitutions in [[17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party|2007]] and [[2008 National People's Congress|2008]], respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by [[Deng Xiaoping]] and implemented by [[Jiang Zemin]], from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his tenure he continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.\n\nWhat emerges from these philosophies, in Hu's view, is a country with a systematic approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous \"nonpublic\" (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in Hu's vision, to a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\". In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophies, which have created a new \"China Model\" of governance, serve as a legitimate alternative to the West's \"Democracy Model\", particularly for developing countries. In Hu's words, \"A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality.\"<ref name=Kuhn/> Such a society, he says, will give full scope to people's talent and creativity, enable all the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government. Hu even emphasized the potential of religious communities to contribute to economic and social development under the banner of \"Building a Harmonious Socialist Society.\"<ref name=\"georgetown1\">{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/china |title=China |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |access-date=14 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316102321/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/china |archive-date=16 March 2013 }} See drop-down essay on \"An Era of Opening\"</ref>\n\nWestern criticism of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability but does not lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China's [[Social issues in the People's Republic of China|multi-faceted social problems]].<ref name=Kuhn/> Hu's pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values\u2014maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally practiced, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the gap between rich and poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.<ref name=\"Zhao Suisheng 2010\">Zhao Suisheng, \"Chinese foreign policy under Hu Jintao: The struggle between low-profile policy and diplomatic activism.\" ''Hague Journal of Diplomacy'' 5.4 (2010): 357-378.</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Hu gave an unprecedented showing and ordered all cadres from the five major power functions to stop the tradition of going to the [[Beidaihe District|Beidaihe]] seaside retreat for their annual summer meeting, which, before, was commonly seen as a gathering of ruling elites from both current and elder cadres to decide China's destiny, and also an unnecessary waste of public funds. The move was seen by the Chinese public as symbolic of Hu's attitude towards corruption.\n\nIn June 2007, Hu gave an important speech at the [[Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party|Central Party School]] that was indicative of his position of power and his guiding philosophies. In the speech Hu used a very populist tone to appeal to ordinary Chinese, making serious note of the recent challenges China was facing, especially with regards to income disparity. In addition, Hu noted the need for \"increased democracy\" in the country.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratization in China, Korea and Southeast Asia?: Local and National Perspectives (Politics in Asia)|last=Zhou|first=Kate Xiao|publisher=Routledge; 1 edition}}</ref>\n\n===Taiwan===\nEarly in his [[Hu\u2013Wen Administration|leadership]], Hu faced a pro-independence counterpart in then ROC president [[Chen Shui-bian]]. Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the [[1992 consensus]]. Chen Shui-bian and [[Democratic Progressive Party|his party]] had continued to express an ultimate goal of [[de jure]] [[Taiwanese independence]], and made statements on the [[political status of Taiwan]] that the PRC considers provocative. Hu's initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches. On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan. On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to [[Chinese unification]] as an ultimate goal. While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with [[Taiwan]] as in his [[17 May Statement]], where he offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China.<ref name=\"Zhao Suisheng 2010\"/>\n\nAfter Chen's re-election in 2004, Hu's government changed tactics, conducting a no-contact policy with Taiwan due to Chen and the DPP's independence leanings and repudiation of the 1992 consensus. The government maintained its military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the [[Anti-Secession Law]] was passed by the [[National People's Congress]], formalizing \"non-peaceful means\" as an option of response to a declaration of independence in Taiwan.\n\nHu's government increased contacts with the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), its erstwhile foe in the [[Chinese Civil War]], and still a major party in Taiwan. The increased contacts culminated in the [[2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China]], including a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman [[Lien Chan]] in April 2005. This was the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the conclusion of World War II.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sisci |first=Francesco |title=Strange cross-Taiwan Strait bedfellows |work=Asia Times |date=5 April 2005 |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/GD05Ad08.html |access-date=15 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512150111/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/GD05Ad08.html |archive-date=12 May 2008 |url-status=unfit }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Zhong |first=Wu |title=KMT makes China return in historic trip to ease tensions |work=The Standard |date=29 March 2005 |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Front_Page/GC29Aa02.html |access-date=16 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602220112/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/stdn/std/Front_Page/GC29Aa02.html |archive-date=2 June 2008 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 March 2008, the Kuomintang under [[Ma Ying-jeou]] won the presidency in Taiwan, and a majority in the [[Legislative Yuan]].

On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao met with Taiwan's vice president-elect [[Vincent Siew]] in the latter's role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the [[Boao Forum for Asia]]. On 28 May 2008, Hu met with KMT chairman [[Wu Poh-hsiung]], the first meeting between the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties. During this meeting, Hu and Wu agreed that both sides should re-commence official dialogue under the 1992 consensus &ndash; that \"both sides recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on its definition.\" Wu committed the new government in Taiwan against Taiwanese independence; Hu committed his government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and \"international living space\", with a priority given to allowing Taiwan to participate in the [[World Health Organization]].\n\nIn addition to the party-to-party dialogue, de facto governmental dialogue took place via the [[Straits Exchange Foundation]] and the [[Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits]] in June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Both Hu and his new counterpart [[Ma Ying-jeou]] agreed that the 1992 Consensus is the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. On 26 March 2008, Hu Jintao held a telephone talk with then US president [[George W. Bush]], in which he became the first Chinese leader to officially recognize the 1992 Consensus.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chinese, U.S. presidents hold telephone talks on Taiwan, Tibet |publisher=Xinhuanet |date=27 March 2008 |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/27/content_7865209.htm |access-date=15 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512002546/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-03/27/content_7865209.htm |archive-date=12 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After several months of negotiations, in December 2008, the two sides agreed on the resumption of the [[Three Links]], i.e., a re-opening of mail, trade, and direct air links between the two sides.

Whether this is Hu's contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory is debatable, but its general reception with the Chinese public has been moderate. Its promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and [[World Expo 2010]] in Shanghai. The codes differ from the ideologies of his predecessors, namely, Jiang's Three Represents, [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], and [[Mao Zedong Thought]] in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.<ref>Guoxin Xing, \"Hu Jintao's Political Thinking and Legitimacy Building: A Post-Marxist Perspective.\" ''Asian Affairs'' 36.4 (2009): 213-226.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nHu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|global financial crisis]] relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely.<ref name=chengli>{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Cheng|author2=Eve Cary|title=The Last Year of Hu's Leadership: Hu's to Blame?|journal=Jamestown Foundation: China Brief|date=20 December 2011|volume=11|issue=23|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38811&cHash=c0006cd99bfe551991fcf1924d37c0cf|access-date=2 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530050317/http://www.jamestown.org/programs/chinabrief/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=38811&cHash=c0006cd99bfe551991fcf1924d37c0cf|archive-date=30 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Hu's achievements included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first manned space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] and the [[2010 Shanghai Expo]].<ref name=chengli/> In addition, Hu's \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a [[Kuomintang]] government in Taipei, improved the [[Cross-Strait relations|relationship between mainland China and Taiwan]]. Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu's tenure. In addition, Hu and premier [[Wen Jiabao]]'s populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the [[SARS]] public health crisis and the massive expansion of [[Healthcare reform in China|health insurance coverage]] for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically.

While there were some attempts to increase transparency in the expenditures of official organs and bureaucrats, deeply entrenched systemic issues that were contributing to the growth of corruption remained unresolved. In addition, the massive corruption scandal that ensnared the military shortly after Hu's departure from office showed that Hu was unable to tackle entrenched interests in the military. In his own departing speech at the 18th Party Congress, Hu emphasized the potentially devastating effects that unchecked corruption would have on the party and the country. Moreover, the Hu administration's insistence on censorship and the curtailing of freedom of speech drew extensive criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments,<ref name=chengli/> while artists and writers inside the country chided increased restrictions on cultural expressions during Hu's term. Although in the early years of his tenure Hu attempted to pioneer a form of \"intraparty democracy\" that called for greater participation from lower-ranked members to determine policy and select the leadership, there was little evidence of meaningful changes to the party's governing structure and decision-making process.<ref name=talkchange/>\n\nConsensus-based decision-making became a hallmark of the Hu era. Hu was never a strongman, did not rule by fist, and was often seen as first-among-equals with his [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|Politburo Standing Committee]] colleagues. Some called China's political landscape during Hu's era one of \"nine dragons taming the water\" ({{zh|s=\u4e5d\u9f99\u6cbb\u6c34|labels=no}}), that is, nine PSC members each ruling over their own fief. In addition, Hu not only faced a profusion of special interest groups and political factions within the party, his ability to implement a cohesive program was also constrained by the influence of former leader [[Jiang Zemin]].<ref name=hujintao>{{cite news|last1=Zhang|first1=Guangzhao|script-title=zh:\u516c\u6b63\u8bc4\u4ef7\u80e1\u9526\u6d9b\u7684\u5341\u5e74|url=http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001047627?full=y|work=Financial Times Chinese|language=zh-hans|date=21 December 2012|access-date=17 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162147/http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001047627?full=y|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Consequently, there is debate on how much power Hu held personally to effect change.
