Mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] from 1983 to 2002, he was [[Ministry of the Economy and Finance (France)|Minister of the Budget]] under Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995) during [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]]'s second term. During [[Jacques Chirac's second term as President of France|Jacques Chirac's second presidential term]] he served as [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] and as [[Minister of Finances (France)|Minister of Finances]]. He was the leader of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP) party from 2004 to 2007.\n\nHe won the [[2007 French presidential election]] by a 53.1% to 46.9% margin against [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]], the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS) candidate. During his term, he faced the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] (causing a [[Late-2000s recession|recession]], the [[European debt crisis|European sovereign debt crisis]]), the [[Russo-Georgian War]] (for which he negotiated a ceasefire) and the [[Arab Spring]] (especially in [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], and [[Syria]]). He initiated the [[Liberties and Responsibilities of Universities (France)|reform of French universities]] (2007) and the [[Pensions in France|pension reform]] (2010). He married Italian-French singer-songwriter [[Carla Bruni]] in 2008 at the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]] in Paris.\n\nIn the [[2012 French presidential election]], Sarkozy was defeated by the PS candidate [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]], by a 3.2% margin. After leaving the presidential office, Sarkozy vowed to retire from public life before coming back in 2014, being subsequently reelected as UMP leader (renamed [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] in 2015). Being defeated at the [[2016 The Republicans (France) presidential primary|Republican presidential primary]] in 2016, he retired from public life. He was [[Nicolas Sarkozy corruption trial|charged with corruption]] by French prosecutors in two cases, notably concerning the [[Alleged Libyan financing in the 2007 French presidential election|alleged Libyan interference in the 2007 French elections]]. In 2021, Sarkozy [[Nicolas Sarkozy corruption trial|was convicted]] of corruption in two separate trials. His first conviction resulted in him receiving a sentence of three years, two of them suspended and one in prison; he has appealed against the ruling. For his second conviction, he received a one-year sentence, which he is allowed to serve under home confinement.\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Family background ===\n{{Main|Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy}}\n\nSarkozy was born in Paris, and is the son of [[Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy|P\u00e1l Istv\u00e1n Ern\u0151 S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy de Nagy-B\u00f3csa]]{{NoteTag|\"Sarkozy\" is the westernized, or internationalized, version of his Hungarian name. In Hungarian the given name comes last rather than first. The French aristocratic particle \"de\" is also used instead of the Hungarian aristocratic ending \"-i\". This westernization of Hungarian names is frequent, particularly for people with an aristocratic name. For example the leader of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, whose Hungarian name is nagyb\u00e1nyai Horthy Mikl\u00f3s, is known in English as [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy|Mikl\u00f3s Horthy de Nagyb\u00e1nya]]. The French name of P\u00e1l S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy de Nagy-B\u00f3csa changed in 1948 to Paul \u00c9tienne Arnaud Sark\u00f6zy de Nagy-Bocsa, when P\u00e1l was translated as Paul in French, and the acute accents on the \"a\" of Sark\u00f6zy and the \"o\" of Bocsa were dropped as these letters never carry an acute accent (''accent aigu'') in French. The [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] on the \"o\" of S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy was kept, probably because French typewriters allow this combination, whereas it is impossible to write \"a\" or \"o\" with an acute accent using a French typewriter.}} ({{lang-hu|<!--Leave the lower case 'n' please, it's not an error!-->nagyb\u00f3csai S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy P\u00e1l}}; {{IPA-hu|\u02c8n\u0252\u025fbo\u02d0t\u0361\u0283\u0252i \u02c8\u0283a\u02d0rk\u00f8zi \u02c8pa\u02d0l||Pal_sarkozy.ogg}}\u2014in some sources ''Nagy-B\u00f3csay S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy P\u00e1l Istv\u00e1n Ern\u0151''),<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/opinion/15tue4.html | title=The New French President's Roots Are Worth Remembering | date=15 May 2007 | access-date=28 September 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Serge | last=Schmemann | archive-date=23 July 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723115200/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/opinion/15tue4.html | url-status=live }}</ref> (born 5 May 1928), a [[Protestant]] [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and [[Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy|Andr\u00e9e Jeanne \"Dadu\" Mallah]] (12 October 1925 \u2013 12 December 2017),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ledauphine.com/france-monde/2017/12/13/la-mere-de-nicolas-sarkozy-andre-mallah-dite-dadu-est-morte | title=La m\u00e8re de Nicolas Sarkozy, Andr\u00e9e Mallah dite \"Dadu\", est morte | date=13 December 2017 | publisher=Le Dauphin\u00e9 | access-date=20 July 2020 | archive-date=21 July 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200721035205/https://www.ledauphine.com/france-monde/2017/12/13/la-mere-de-nicolas-sarkozy-andre-mallah-dite-dadu-est-morte | url-status=live }}</ref> whose [[Ottoman Greeks|Ottoman]] [[Greek Jew]]ish father converted to Catholicism to marry Sarkozy's French Catholic maternal grandmother.<ref name=BBCProf>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm |title=Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy |work=BBC News |date=26 July 2009 |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-date=1 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401164649/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3673102.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/22741|title=A Greek book on Nicolas Sarkozy|publisher=The European Jewish Press|access-date=12 April 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417061636/http://www.ejpress.org/article/22741|archive-date=17 April 2008}}</ref> They were married in the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois-de-Sales church, [[17th arrondissement of Paris]], on 8 February 1950, and divorced in 1959.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/noble/sarkozy.html |title=Ancestry of Nicolas Sarkozy |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-date=27 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827220612/http://www.wargs.com/noble/sarkozy.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Early life===\nDuring Sarkozy's childhood, his father founded his own advertising agency and became wealthy. The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy's maternal grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the [[17th arrondissement]] of Paris.

According to Sarkozy, his staunchly [[Gaullist]] grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was raised Catholic.<ref name=BBCProf/>\n\nSarkozy said that being abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today.

Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the [[May 1968 events in France|May '68]] student movement and was still a stronghold of [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] students.

His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Worship]]: in this role he created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]] (CFCM). Previously, he was a d\u00e9put\u00e9 in the [[French National Assembly]]. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including [[Finance Minister]].\n\n===In Government: 1993\u20131995===\nSarkozy's political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. A member of the [[Neo-Gaullist]] party RPR, he went on to be elected [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor [[Achille Peretti]]. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. A more senior RPR councillor, [[Charles Pasqua]], wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy took that opportunity to propel himself into the office of mayor.<ref>''[[Le Parisien]]'', 11 January 2007</ref> He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000.

Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Jacques Chirac]]. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of \u20ac200&nbsp;billion (US$260&nbsp;billion) (FY 1994\u20131996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP.{{NoteTag|See also [[:fr:Dette publique de la France|Dette publique de la France]] {{in lang|fr}}}} According to the [[Maastricht Treaty]], the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France's GDP.\n\nIn 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed \u00c9douard Balladur for [[President of France]]. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power.\n\nHowever, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the [[1997 French legislative election|1997 parliamentary election]], as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader [[Philippe S\u00e9guin]] resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the [[1999 European Parliament election in France|1999 European Parliament election]], winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident [[Rally for France]] of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.\n[[File:Sarkozy-congres-ump.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy speaking at the congress of his party, 28 November 2004]]\nIn 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see [[2002 French presidential election]]), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for President in 1995.<ref>[http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html Sauced Sarkozy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902135114/http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html |date=2 September 2013 }} Felice E.

Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] became clear.\n\nIn party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between ''sarkozystes'', such as Sarkozy's \"first lieutenant\", [[Brice Hortefeux]], and Chirac loyalists, such as [[Jean-Louis Debr\u00e9]].\n\nSarkozy was made Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]]) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]].

This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.\n\n===First term as Minister of the Interior: 2002\u20132004===\n\nTowards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004.\n\nSarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the [[Islam in France|Muslim community]]. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Conseil fran\u00e7ais du culte musulman]] (\"French Council of the Muslim Faith\"), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.<ref>''[[Journal Officiel de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise|JO associations]]'', 28 May 2003</ref> In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public funds<ref>[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&sec=59&con=2 WorldWide Religious News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224071400/http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&sec=59&con=2 |date=24 December 2008 }}</ref> so that they are less reliant on money from outside France.

In 2005, he supported a \"yes\" vote in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], but the \"No\" vote won.\n\nThroughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France's economic and social policies.

Sarkozy rejects this label of ''lib\u00e9ral'' and prefers to call himself a pragmatist.\n\nSarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with [[:wikt:quota|quota]]s designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy.
